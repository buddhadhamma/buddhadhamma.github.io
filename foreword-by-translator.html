<p>It is said that a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first
step. The first step, however, may be initiated by many different
causes. The journey of completing this translation of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> in
a sense began accidentally, or at least serendipitously.</p>
<p>In November 1994, after completing my 7-year training as an <em>anāgārika</em>
(white-robed novice) and newly-ordained bhikkhu (<em>nāvaka</em>) in the
monasteries situated in the UK led by Ven. Ajahn Sumedho (Tahn Chao Khun
Rājasumedhācāriya), I asked permission from the elders in the UK to
spend some time in Thailand, the spiritual home of the branch
monasteries connected to the Luang Por Chah tradition. My request was
granted and I was given a oneway ticket.</p>
<p>With only a rudimentary understanding of the Thai language, I went first
to Wat Pah Nanachat in Ubon Ratchathani, where Ven. Ajahn Jayasaro was
currently the acting abbot. Coincidentally, during the first month while
I was there, the community was blessed with a rare visit by Ven. Phra
Payutto, who spent several days giving teachings in English. I had of
course heard of Tahn Chao Khun Payutto, whose scholarship was renowned
in the Western monasteries and whose books – in particular his
<em>Dictionary of Buddhism</em> – was widely read. I also knew that he had
lectured at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, where I had studied
comparative religion as an undergraduate.</p>
<p>During those days at Wat Pah Nanachat he gave a talk on happiness.
Although I hadn’t ever heard anyone emphasize the central importance of
happiness in Buddhist practice at all levels of the Path, it wasn’t so
much the subject of the talk as the manner of the presentation that
moved me so deeply. Than Chao Khun radiated happiness – he seemed to
embody the joy of one who has tasted the fruits of happiness and who
wishes to impart the accompanying knowledge with others. It is not an
exaggeration to say that I was moved to tears. Although this was an
inchoate form of bliss, based on devotion, it nonetheless infused me
with energy and interest. His talk had served its purpose.</p>
<p>I spent most of the next six years walking tudong<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> in Thailand as
well as living in a remote branch monastery – Wat Phoo Jorm Gorm – by
the Mekong River bordering Laos. As a monk, and even before that, I
always had a strong academic leaning. Rather than using a standard
course book or language teacher, I learned Thai primarily by carrying
small Dhamma books (by Ajahn Buddhadasa, Tahn Chao Khun Paññānanda,
Luang Por Chah, etc.) on my travels. For long periods of time these
books were my companions. In 2001 I felt the need to deepen my
theoretical or academic understanding of Buddhism, in part because as an
11-vassa monk (and thus officially a ‘Thera’ or ‘Ajahn’) I was expected
to provide more formal teachings to the lay community.</p>
<p>I decided to ask permission from Ven. Phra Payutto to live with him at
Wat Nyanavesakavan in Nakhon Pathom province. Ajahn Jayasaro took me to
meet him. Rather than granting permission immediately, Tahn Chao Khun
looked at me and asked: ‘What are you going to do here?’ Obviously this
was no place to simply eat and lay back. I replied that I wanted to read
the Tipiṭaka in Thai. Tahn Chao Khun seemed satisfied with this answer.</p>
<p>Not long after moving to Wat Nyanavesakavan, I asked Tahn Chao Khun
about the <em>Buddhadhamma</em> translation project. I knew that Mr. Bruce
Evans (formerly Puriso Bhikkhu) had spent several years working on this
book during the 90’s. Two of the chapters – on Dependent Origination
and on Kamma – had been published and very well received. But for some
reason, the project had come to a standstill. Tahn Chao Khun asked me
whether I would be willing to look at the unfinished manuscript and see
whether it could be polished up and made ready for publication. Very
soon, however, it became apparent that editing or rewriting someone
else’s work, at least in this case, was significantly more difficult
than translating the entire text from scratch.</p>
<p>And so the journey began. At first it seemed like walking through a
garden filled with exotic flowers, set on gentle foothills. I had no
specific destination in mind. It was simply a matter of replacing my
original goal of reading the Tipiṭaka with this new activity. I would
joke with people, saying that it would take me several lifetimes to
complete the entire translation.</p>
<p>In 2003 I returned to the UK and acted as abbot of Hartridge Buddhist
Monastery in Devon. In my spare time I would work on the translation,
until, in 2007, I completed chapter 3 (I chose not to work sequentially
on the text, but rather selected subjects that were of particular
interest to me at the time). This was published as a separate volume
titled <em>The Three Signs: Anicca, Dukkha &amp; Anattā in the Buddha’s
Teachings</em>. The book was sponsored by Khun Sirichan Bhirombhakdi and her
two daughters.</p>
<p>In 2007, after having struggled with a debilitating physical illness
over the entire nineteen years of my monastic life, I decided to disrobe
and see if life as a layman would bring about an improvement of health.
Whereas it appeared as if the translation project would come to an
abrupt halt, or enter a period of long abeyance, things in fact took an
opposite turn, impelling me, metaphorically, from the foothills into
elevated heights, where rhododendron trees bloom and the tree line gives
out to expansive, moraine-sculpted valleys. Only weeks after disrobing
in the UK I received a phone call from Khun Sirichan, urging me to
return to Thailand and continue with the <em>Buddhadhamma</em> project. She
made it clear that, in her mind, it was irrelevant whether I was in
robes or not – she wished to support me and enable this valuable
enterprise to be sustained. And so a new chapter of my life began.</p>
<p>Once in Thailand, I continued on the translation in earnest.
Fortuitously, Khun Yongyut Dhanapura, the president of the Buddhadhamma
Foundation, heard about the work I was doing and proposed that I
continue with this project under the auspices of this organization. This
enabled me to have all the proper documentation to stay longterm in
Thailand and also to receive a salary so that I could earn a living.
Here the journey began its most regular and consistent interval. One
step at a time, one page of translation a day.</p>
<p>Although the actual translation of the text was completed in November
2014, it has taken another two years to attend to all the necessary
details involved in preparing the text for publication. Ven. Ajahn
Jayasaro kindly read through the manuscript and we met regularly to make
corrections and improvements. After this, the entire formal preparation
for publication began – selecting fonts, font sizes, margins &amp; spacing,
hyphenations, index, bibliography, contents, etc.</p>
<p>The journey now comes to end, although I hope the book itself will have
a life of its own and travel into the world. Although I don’t claim to
have reached a summit – that honour rests with the author – I have
reached a high saddle or plateau, circumambulating with devotion Tahn
Chao Khun’s crowning achievement. As a bonus I have been afforded rare
glimpses and insights into the Dhamma. The project would never have
reached this stage without devotion and love – a faith and devotion in
Tahn Chao Khun’s ability to elucidate the Buddha’s teachings and a love
of truth and goodness. Those of you who read the chapter on desire will
recognize this latter quality as <em>chanda</em> – the first factor of the
four roads to success.</p>
<p>It was perhaps an audacious step to use <em>Buddhadhamma</em> as my sharpening
stone in learning the skills of translation. I was not a proficient
translator or writer when I began this project. In this light, I have
most likely not done full justice to the original Thai book. It is
possible that I may have translated some passages incorrectly. If as
readers you have doubt about any of the material, I have inserted the
page numbers of the Thai edition into the text, in curly brackets, so
that you can compare the English with the original. I have confidence,
however, that with the help of my editors, in particular Ven. Ajahn
Jayasaro, the book contains no blatant distortions or discrepancies.</p>
<p>Besides attempting to capture the meaning of the original Thai text, it
has also been a challenge to find a suitable style of translation.
Developing such a style was part of the evolution of translating this
book. I think it is fair to say that the way in which ideas are formally
conveyed in the Thai language differs from the traditional method of
English compositions. One friend explained the distinction thus: Thai
follows an inductive method whereas English traditionally follows a
deductive method. Whether this is an accurate description or not, the
text of the Thai edition of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> often follows what I would
describe as a series of concentric circles, returning repeatedly to a
similar premise. Using this same method in the English translation
seemed inappropriate. If one is not used to this style, one can easily
feel that, rather than adding layers of meaning and elucidation, one is
encountering unnecessary repetition or redundancy. I have therefore
reorganized the text accordingly, on many levels: paragraphs, chapter
sections, and even entire chapters have been shifted. When key changes
were made I consulted with the author to receive his approval. In any
case, I can state with conviction that I have neither removed any
important text or added my own interpolations.</p>
<p>One major task involved locating equivalent scriptural references used
in the footnotes. This was not difficult with references to the Pali
Canon, since the BUDSIR program (version 7) developed by Mahidol
University contains a quick and easy to use search option for finding
the corresponding Pali Text Society page numbers, matching the page
numbers in the Thai Pali Tipiṭaka. The challenge was greatly multiplied,
however, when faced with references to the commentaries,
sub-commentaries, and other non-canonical texts. In most cases, I would
have to copy the relevant Pali passage using the BUDSIR program, which
does not give the PTS page numbers, and then try to match it by typing
Pali terms in Roman script and pasting them into the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana
Tipiṭaka program (version 4.0), which does provide pages numbers, or
sometimes only headings, to the PTS editions. The BUDSIR program is
based on the Siam Raṭṭha Pāli Tipiṭaka (supplemented by the Thai
translation called the Royal Tipiṭaka) which is the source of the
references in <em>Buddhadhamma</em> (see bibliography). It is quite possible
that there are errors with some of these footnote references. If readers
spot any errors I would be grateful if you contact me so that I can make
corrections for future printings. In the case where numbers are in
brackets this indicates that I was unable to find an equivalent PTS (or
other Roman alphabet) page number. Again, hopefully these will be
updated in the future.</p>
<p>So many people have been supportive and helpful with this project that
it is impossible to name everyone. The most important people are as
follows:</p>
<p>First and foremost, my gratitude extends to Ven. Phra Payutto, who,
besides being a constant inspiration and beacon of wisdom and
compassion, has bestowed so much trust and confidence in my ability to
complete this project at a required quality and standard. Although, due
to his many other responsibilities and limitations on the physical
level, he has not been able to read through the entire English
translation, he has always answered my questions and doubts punctually
when they arose. Although I may have been able to reflect some of his
depth of wisdom and intellectual brilliance, it is beyond my powers to
transport his beaming smile and radiant kindness to the reader. Those of
you who have had the good fortune to meet him know what I’m talking
about.</p>
<p>Second, I give my thanks to Ven. Ajahn Jayasaro, who has provided me
with so much encouragement on many levels throughout the past fifteen
years (and beyond that). He shares a similar devotion to Tahn Chao Khun
Payutto, as well as a love for language. Our time poring over this
manuscript has deepened my respect for and friendship with him.</p>
<p>Third, I thank Khun Sirichan Bhirombhakdi for acting as the catalyst in
bringing me back to Thailand to continue this work until it reached
completion. Sometimes we must hear the words ‘I believe in you’ to
overcome inertia or other mental obstacles.</p>
<p>Fourth, this project would not have been completed without the
enthusiasm and support by Khun Yongyut Thanapura, president of the
Buddhadhamma Foundation. It was through his initiative and longterm
vision that this book has materialized.</p>
<p>My mother and stepfather – Karin &amp; Jon Gunnemann, and my father and
step-mother – Basil &amp; Subithra Moore, have given me material and
emotional support over the years, including a time when I was between
jobs. Important editors and proofreaders over the years include: Ven.
Gavesako Bhikkhu, Ven. Cittasaṁvaro Bhikkhu, Ron Lumsden, Max
Mackay-James, and Martin Seeger. I thank Mr. Bruce Evans for letting me
consult with his earlier translations of <em>Buddhadhamma</em>, a work he did
with great dedication. Other people who have provided notable support
include Mr. Sian Mah and Mrs. Chantana Ouysook.</p>
<p>May these collective efforts help to bring light and peace to the world
through the power of wisdom and understanding. The Buddha bequeathed the
Dhammavinaya to us, to safeguard and uphold. This entails more than
simply keeping copies of the Tipiṭaka in glass-fronted bookshelves.
Although the realization of the Buddha’s teachings may be summarized as
a fulfilment of the four duties vis-à-vis the Four Noble Truths, i.e.
understanding suffering, removing its cause, realizing its cessation,
and cultivating the Path, or more succinctly, knowing suffering and the
end of suffering, many tools and skilful methods may be needed to
accomplish this goal. The beauty of the Buddha’s teachings is that they
provide us with a treasure chest of insights and guidelines. Another
metaphor is that the Dhamma is a multifaceted diamond. No matter from
what direction you pick it up, it offers invaluable glimpses of truth
which may be used to cut through the shrouds of delusion. These
teachings were expanded upon and elucidated by later commentarial
authors. Ven. Phra Payutto’s gift and genius here is to present the
canonical and post-canonical teachings in a lucid integrated whole, a
watertight vessel for taking us to the other shore. The work to be
undertaken is still ours to do, but the Path, and its many obstacles,
has been clearly outlined and revealed.</p>

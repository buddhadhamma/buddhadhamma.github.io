<h2><a class="header" href="#the-role-of-reflection-in-a-wholesome-way-of-life" id="the-role-of-reflection-in-a-wholesome-way-of-life">The Role of Reflection in a Wholesome Way of Life</a></h2>
<p>For people to find true happiness they must live their lives correctly
and relate to things properly, including their own personal lives, their
society, technology, and their natural environment. Those people who
live their lives correctly experience a personal happiness inherently
conducive to the happiness of others.</p>
<p>The expression to live one’s life correctly, or to relate to all things
properly, is a general or undetailed reference to spiritual practice.
For a clearer description one must separate and distinguish correct
practice into various minor activities, and examine many aspects of a
person’s life. It is useful therefore to describe the different parts of
spiritual practice, which together comprise the entirety of living one’s
life correctly. Hereby, one defines the subtleties of living correctly,
revealing the different aspects of proper practice.</p>
<p>From one perspective, to live one’s life is to struggle for survival, to
try and escape from oppressive and obstructive forces, and to discover
wellbeing. In brief, this aspect to life is the solving of problems or
the ending of suffering. Those people who are able to solve and escape
from problems correctly reach true success in life and live free from
suffering. Therefore, to live correctly and with success can be defined
as an ability to solve problems.</p>
<p>From another perspective, to live one’s life is to engage in various
activities, manifesting as different forms of physical and verbal
behaviour. When such activity is not expressed outwardly, then it
manifests internally, as mental behaviour. This refers to acts of body,
speech and mind, which are technically referred to as volitional
physical actions (<em>kāya-kamma</em>), verbal actions (<em>vacī-kamma</em>), and
mental actions (<em>mano-kamma</em>). Collectively, they are referred to as
kamma by way of the three ‘doorways’ (<em>dvāra</em>).</p>
<p>From this perspective life consists of engaging in these three kinds of
actions. Those people who perform these three actions correctly live
their lives well. Therefore, to live correctly and with success can be
defined as knowing how to act, speak, and think – to be skilled at
performing physical actions (including one’s work and profession),
speaking (or communication in general), and thinking. {608}</p>
<p>From yet another perspective, an analysis of human life reveals that it
consists of various forms of cognition, of experiencing objects of
awareness or sense stimuli, which are collectively referred to as ‘sense
objects’ (<em>ārammaṇa</em>). These sense impressions pass through or manifest
by way of the six sense bases (<em>āyatana</em>): the eye, ear, nose, tongue,
body, and mind. The receiving of these sense impressions consists of
seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, contacting tactile impressions, and
cognizing mind objects: i.e, to see, to hear, to smell, to taste, to
feel physical feelings, and to think.</p>
<p>The response and attitudes of people in regard to cognition of these
sense stimuli have a crucial bearing on their lives, conduct, and
fortune. If they respond to sense impressions solely with delight and
aversion, with likes and dislikes, the chain of distress is set in
motion. If they respond in the manner of recording information, however,
and see things according to the truth – see things according to cause
and effect – they will go in the direction of wisdom and towards a true
solution to problems.</p>
<p>A factor that is no less vital than the response and attitudes towards
sense impressions is the ability to select sense objects. For example,
one may incline towards and choose to listen to and watch those things
which gratify desire, or one may choose to listen to and observe those
things that support wisdom and enhance the quality of the mind.</p>
<p>From this perspective to live correctly and successfully can be defined
as knowing how to receive and select sense impressions – to be skilled
at seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, contacting tactile objects, and
thinking.</p>
<p>There is one more perspective to take into consideration. One way to
describe human life is to highlight the engagement and relationship to
phenomena in order to derive benefit from these things.</p>
<p>For most people the consumption or enjoyment of sense pleasures plays a
very significant role. When engaging with people or things in their
surroundings, whether this be their society or the natural environment,
most people seek to derive some kind of benefit or advantage from them
in order to satisfy their wishes or to gratify their desires. In other
words, when they wish to satisfy desires they go out and engage with
these people and things.</p>
<p>The preceding factor – of looking at life as a process of cognition –
contains two aspects: that of pure cognition, say of seeing and hearing,
and that of engagement, say of looking and listening. The skill of
receiving and selecting sense impressions (e.g. a skill at seeing or
hearing) is related to this factor of engagement.</p>
<p>To engage with or to consume things properly is a vital factor in
determining and shaping a person’s life and degree of happiness.
Therefore, to live correctly and successfully can be defined as being
skilled in engaging with and relating to things. In the context of
society this refers to knowing how to relate and associate with other
people. In the context of material things and the natural environment
this refers to knowing how to use and consume things properly.</p>
<p>In sum, a correct and successful way of life encompasses several
subsidiary forms of behaviour and is comprised of various aspects,
notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>From the perspective of escaping from problems, one is skilled at
solving them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the perspective of performing actions, one is skilled at
thinking, speaking (or communicating), and performing physical
deeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the perspective of receiving sense impressions, one is skilled
at seeing, listening, smelling, tasting, contacting tactile
impressions, and thinking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the perspective of engagement or consumption, one is skilled at
using and consuming things, and at relating to other people. {609}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To practise these various aspects of life properly is referred to as
‘living one’s life correctly’, ‘knowing how to live’, or ‘being skilled
at conducting one’s life’. According to Buddha-Dhamma, a life lived in
such a manner is considered a virtuous life.</p>
<p>These various aspects of life, or aspects of spiritual practice, can be
summed up by the phrase: ‘knowing how to think’ or ‘being skilled at
reflection’. They all involve the process of thinking, which is a vital
factor for living one’s life correctly. Thinking plays an important role
on many levels, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the context of cognition, thinking is the meeting point, where
various information and data gathers and assembles. It is where data
is analyzed, shaped, and applied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the context of volitional actions, thinking is the starting
point, which leads to outward verbal and physical expressions – to
speech and physical action. Moreover, it is the command centre,
which determines or controls speech and physical deeds, according to
one’s thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the relationship between these two forms of behaviour, thinking
is the centre point – it is the link between cognition and
volitional actions. When one experiences things by way of the sense
bases, and then gathers, processes, and analyzes this sense data,
thinking dictates the consequent outward expressions of speech and
physical actions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, correct thinking or the skill of reflection is the seat of
administration in regard to correct living in its entirety. It is the
leader, guide and director for all other aspects of right practice. When
one is able to think correctly, one is also able to speak correctly, act
correctly, and solve problems correctly. One is skilled at seeing,
hearing, eating, using material things, consuming things, and
associating with others – one is skilled at living. A skill in thinking
and reflection leads to a virtuous life.</p>
<p>A decisive factor determining a person’s skill in regard to volitional
action is spiritual balance. Generally speaking, in this context the
terms ‘skill’ and ‘balance’ have the same meaning. To act skilfully is
to act in a correct, even way, giving rise to desired results according
to one’s intentions and objectives. One acts in a way that is accurate,
coherent, direct, and consistent, enabling one to reach one’s goal in
the most optimum way, without creating any kinds of harm or faults.</p>
<p>In the context of reaching one’s goal, the Buddhist teachings give great
emphasis to the characteristics of faultlessness, freedom from
affliction, and suitability, the meanings of which are encompassed in
the word ‘spiritual balance’. Thus the term ‘skill in conducting one’s
life’ can be defined as ‘living a balanced life’: to live with
moderation and in a suitable way in order to attain the goal of life in
a truly blameless and joyful manner.</p>
<p>The technical term for a life of balance, for suitable practice, or for
a virtuous life is the ‘middle way’ (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>), which refers
to the Path (<em>magga</em>): the Noble Eightfold Path. The Middle Way is the
virtuous, sublime life, free from harm and affliction, leading to utter
safety and complete happiness.</p>
<p>Buddha-Dhamma teaches that in order to live correctly or to lead a
virtuous life one must pass through a process of spiritual training and
study. One can say that the Path arises as a result of spiritual
training. Just as skilful reflection is the guiding principle of a
virtuous life or of the Path, so too, cultivating one’s skills in the
area of thinking is the leading factor in formal spiritual training
(<em>sikkhā</em>). {610}</p>
<p>Within the process of spiritual training, developing a skill in
reflection leads to correct understanding, correct ideas, and even
correct beliefs, which are collectively referred to as ‘right view’
(<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>), which is the mainstay of a virtuous life in its
entirety. The cultivation of right view is the gist of wisdom
development, which is at the heart of spiritual training.</p>
<p>A skill in reflection involves many methods of thinking and analysis.
Developing such skill in reflection is a unique form of spiritual
training and cultivation.</p>

<p>Before discussing the various methods of thinking, let us review the
role of thinking in spiritual training, especially in the area of wisdom
development, which is the core of such training.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#commencement-of-training" id="commencement-of-training">Commencement of Training</a></h3>
<p>The essence of spiritual training is self-development, with wisdom
development at its core. The key elements of such training are correct
understanding, opinions, ways of thinking, attitudes, and values, which
benefit one’s life and society and conform to truth. In short, this
refers to ‘right view’ (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
<p>When one understands things correctly, one’s thoughts, speech, and
physical actions – that is, all of one’s actions – will be correct,
virtuous, and beneficial, leading to the end of suffering.</p>
<p>Conversely, if one has incorrect understanding, values, attitudes, and
ways of thinking – collectively referred to as ‘wrong view’
(<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>) – all of one’s actions, including one’s thoughts,
speech, and physical actions, will also be incorrect. Instead of solving
problems and ending suffering, one will create more suffering,
accumulate problems, and increase trouble.</p>
<p>Right view can be separated into two levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, those kinds of views, thoughts, opinions, beliefs,
preferences, and values which are connected to an awareness of one’s
actions and the effects of such actions, or which foster a sense of
personal accountability. One sees things correctly in the light of
Dhamma teachings. The precise term for this kind of view is
‘knowledge of being an owner of one’s deeds’ (<em>kammassakatā-ñāṇa</em>).
It is mundane right view (<em>lokiya-sammādiṭṭhi</em>) and pertains to the
level of moral conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, those views and ways of thinking which help to discern how
all conditioned things exist in accord with the law of causality. It
is an understanding of things according to how they really are. One
is not biased by preferences and aversions or swayed by how one
wants things to be or not be. It is a knowledge in harmony with
natural truth and is technically referred to as ‘knowledge
consistent with truth’ (<em>saccānulomika-ñāṇa</em>). It is right view
aligned with transcendent understanding and pertains to the level of
absolute truth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wrong view (<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>), likewise, is comprised of two kinds: those
views, notions, and values which deny a sense of personal accountability
– a refusal to admit one’s own responsibility; and an ignorance of the
world as it really is – the formation of deluded images according to
how one personally wants the world to be. {611}</p>
<p>In any case, the internal spiritual training of an individual begins
with and continues as a result of an engagement with his or her external
environment; it is dependent on external influences which act as a
source of motivation or as conditioning factors. If one receives
teachings, advice, and transmissions from correct sources, or if one is
able to select, discern, contemplate and engage with things properly,
right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>) will arise and true training will ensue.</p>
<p>Conversely, if one receives incorrect teachings, advice and
transmissions, or if one in unable to reflect on, consider, and gain
insight into one’s experiences, wrong view (<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>) will arise
and one will train incorrectly or not train at all.</p>
<p>To review, there are two basic sources of spiritual training, which are
called the ‘prerequisites of right view’:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The external factor of the instruction of others (<em>paratoghosa</em>):
the words or utterance of others. This refers to social influences
and transmissions, for example from parents, teachers, friends,
associates, books, the media, and one’s culture. These outside
influences provide correct information and teachings and they
encourage one to go in a wholesome direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The internal factor of wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>): to be
skilled at reflection; to apply proper methods of thinking and
reasoning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly, there are two sources to wrong training or to a lack of
spiritual training, which are the prerequisites of wrong view:
incorrect, unwholesome instruction by others and an absence of wise
reflection – an inability to reflect wisely.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#process-of-training" id="process-of-training">Process of Training</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the essence of spiritual training is right view.
When right view is firmly established, spiritual training proceeds
effectively.</p>
<p>This process is divided into three major stages, which collectively are
referred to as the three trainings or the threefold training:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Training in higher virtue (<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>): training in the area
of conduct, moral discipline, and uprightness in physical actions,
speech, and livelihood. It can be simply referred to as ‘virtue’
(<em>sīla</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training in higher mind (<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>): the training of the
mind, the cultivation of spiritual qualities, and the development of
mental strength, mental aptitude, and mental health. It can be
simply referred to as ‘concentration’ or ‘mental collectedness’
(<em>samādhi</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training in higher wisdom (<em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>): the development of
wisdom, giving rise to a knowledge of things as they truly are, a
discernment of the causal nature of things, which enables one to
solve problems in line with cause and effect; a thorough
understanding of phenomena, to the extent that one is able to
liberate the mind from all clinging and attachment, eliminate mental
defilement, and bring an end to suffering – to live with a mind
that is free, pure, joyous and bright. It can be simply referred to
as ‘wisdom’ (<em>paññā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The formulation of these three trainings is directly connected to the
teaching referred to as the Noble Path (<em>ariya-magga</em>): the ‘supreme
way’, the ‘noble method for solving problems belonging to the noble
ones’, or the ‘path leading to the cessation of suffering and to the
state of awakening’.</p>
<p>The Noble Path contains eight essential factors or eight aspects of
practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>): correct views, ideas, opinions,
beliefs, attitudes and values; to see things according to causes and
conditions; to see things in harmony with truth or with reality.
{612}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right thought (<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>): thoughts, considerations, and
motives which do not harm oneself or others, are not corrupted by
defilement, and are conducive to wellbeing and happiness, for
example: thoughts of renunciation, well-wishing, kindness, and
benefaction; pure, truthful and righteous thoughts; thoughts free
from selfishness, covetousness, anger, hatred, and malice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right speech (<em>sammā-vācā</em>): honest and upright speech; speech that
is not abusive, deceitful, divisive, slanderous, coarse, trivial, or
pointless; speech that is polite and gentle, promoting friendship
and harmony; rational, beneficial speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right action (<em>sammā-kammanta</em>): righteous, beneficial actions;
non-oppressive, non-harmful actions; actions that build good
relationships, promote cooperation, and lead to a peaceful society.
Specifically, this refers to actions that are not involved in or
contributive to killing or physical injury, to violating the
belongings of others, or to violating the rights of others in regard
to their spouse or cherished items and people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right livelihood (<em>sammā-ājīva</em>): earning a living in righteous
ways, which do not cause trouble or harm to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right effort (<em>sammā-vāyāma</em>): righteous effort, that is: to strive
to prevent and avoid unarisen evil, unwholesome qualities; to strive
to abandon and eliminate arisen evil, unwholesome qualities; to
strive to establish and foster unarisen wholesome qualities; and to
strive to cultivate, increase, and perfect arisen wholesome
qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right mindfulness (<em>sammā-sati</em>): to be vigilant and attentive; to
sustain attention on whichever necessary task one faces in the
moment; to be circumspect about one’s activities; to recollect those
virtuous, supportive, or required factors connected to a specific
activity; to not be absentminded, careless, or negligent. Most
notably, this refers to mindfulness fully attentive to one’s own
physical activities, feelings, state of mind, and thoughts. One does
not allow alluring or annoying sense impressions to lead one astray
or to cause confusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right concentration (<em>sammā-samādhi</em>): firmly established attention;
the mind is focused on an activity or on an object of attention
(<em>ārammaṇa</em>); the mind is one-pointed, calm, relaxed, pure, bright,
and strong; it is malleable and engaged, ready for the effective
application of wisdom; it is not distracted, disturbed, confused,
stressed, rigid, or despondent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The threefold training is designed to bear fruit according to the
principles of practice inherent in the Noble Eightfold Path. This
training generates and develops the eight Path factors. A Dhamma
practitioner makes full use of these Path factors and gradually solves
problems until he or she reaches the complete end of suffering. The
relationship between the threefold training and the Eightfold Path is as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Training in higher virtue: aspects of training giving rise to right
speech, right action, and right livelihood. These three Path factors
are cultivated to the point where one reaches the standard of a
noble being in regard to moral conduct, discipline, and skilful
social interaction. This is the basis for developing the power of
mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training in higher mind: aspects of training giving rise to right
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. These three Path
factors are cultivated to the point where one reaches the standard
of a noble being in regard to spiritual qualities, power of mind,
mental capability, and mental health. This is the basis for
developing wisdom. {613}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training in higher wisdom: aspects of training giving rise to right
view and right thought. These two Path factors are cultivated to the
point where one reaches the standard of a noble being in regard to
wisdom. One’s mind is bright, joyous, and freed from all forms of
grasping and affliction; one reaches true deliverance of mind by way
of wisdom.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned above, right view – the mainstay of spiritual training –
arises dependent on two factors (the prerequisites of right view), which
are the source, origin and starting point of practice. Therefore, in the
activities pertaining to spiritual training special emphasis should be
given to these two factors. Indeed, the expression ‘providing training’
relates precisely to these two factors. As for the three stages of
training – <em>sīla</em>, <em>samādhi</em>, and <em>paññā</em> – they are used simply as
reference points for creating a supportive environment and for ensuring
that the direction of practice proceeds according to proper principles.</p>
<p>Based on this understanding one is able to outline spiritual training as
shown on
Figure <a href="#fig-outline-spiritual-training">Outline of Spiritual Training</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<h3><a class="header" href="#basic-elements-of-spiritual-training" id="basic-elements-of-spiritual-training">Basic Elements of Spiritual Training</a></h3>
<p>From the above section we see that thinking or reflection comprises one
of the two initial factors or sources of spiritual training. To gain a
clear understanding of the vital role of thought, however, it should be
explained in conjunction with the second factor, of the teachings by
others:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these two conditions giving rise to right view: the
words of others and wise reflection.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> {614}</p>
<p><em>A. I. 88.</em></p>
<p>In reference to external factors, I know not of any other single
factor so conducive to great benefit as having a virtuous friend.</p>
<p>In reference to internal factors, I know not of any other single
factor so conducive to great benefit as wise reflection.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These two prerequisites of right view can also be called the forerunners
to spiritual training. They are the wellspring of right view, which is
the starting point and key principle of spiritual practice in its
entirety. Let us review these factors in more depth:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The words of others (<em>paratoghosa</em>): external motivation and
influence; teachings, advice, instruction, transmission, schooling,
proclamations, information, and news coming from external sources.
This also includes imitating or emulating others’ behaviour and
ideas. It is an external or social factor.</p>
<p>Examples of such sources of learning include: one’s parents,
teachers, mentors, friends, companions, co-workers, bosses, and
employees; famous and esteemed people; books, other forms of media,
and religious and cultural institutions. In this context, it refers
specifically to those external influences leading one in a correct,
wholesome direction and providing correct knowledge, and in
particular those enabling one to attain the second factor of wise
reflection.</p>
<p>A person with suitable attributes and qualities, who is able to
perform the function of instruction well, is called a virtuous
friend (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>). Generally speaking, for a virtuous friend
to act effectively and succeed in instructing others, he or she must
be able to instil confidence in the student or practitioner, and
therefore the method of learning here is referred to as the ‘way of
faith’.</p>
<p>If the persons offering instruction, for example parents or
teachers, are unable to establish a sense of trust in the pupil (or
child, as the case may be), who subsequently develops greater
interest and trust in another source of information and thinking,
say in the words of a movie star transmitted via the media, and if
this alternative information is bad or wrong, the process of
learning or training is beset by danger. The end result may be a
wrong form of learning or an absence of true learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>); skilful modes of thinking;
systematic thinking; the ability to contemplate and discern things
according to how they truly exist, for example the recognition that
a specific phenomenon ‘exist just so’. One searches for causes and
conditions, inquires into the source of things, traces the complete
sequence of events, and analyzes things in order to see things as
they are and as conforming to the law of causality. One does not
attach to or distort things out of personal craving and clinging.
Wise reflection leads to wellbeing and an ability to solve problems.
This is an internal, spiritual factor and may be referred to as the
‘way of wisdom’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these two factors, wise reflection is essential and indispensable.
Spiritual training truly bears fruit and its goal is reached as a result
of wise reflection. Indeed, it is possible for wise reflection to
initiate spiritual training without the assistance of external
influences. If one relies on the first factor of external instruction,
it must lead to wise reflection for one’s training to reach completion.
Intuition, insight, and the discovery and realization of truth is
accomplished by way of wise reflection. {615}</p>
<p>Having said this, one should not underestimate the power of the first
factor, of the instruction by others, because only a minute number of
individuals do not need to rely on this factor – those who can progress
solely by the application of wise reflection. These individuals, like
the Buddha, are exceptional. Almost everyone in the world relies on the
instruction by others to help show the way.</p>
<p>All forms of formal and systematic education, both in the past and in
the present, and all forms of schooling in the field of the arts and
sciences are matters pertaining to this factor of the ‘words of others’
(<em>paratoghosa</em>). The wholesome transmission of knowledge by way of
virtuous friends thus deserves the utmost care and attention.</p>
<p>A point that needs to be reiterated here is that in providing an
education or skilful instruction, a virtuous friend needs to constantly
keep in mind that this instruction must act as a catalyst for the
arising of wise reflection in the students.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#thinking-conducive-to-spiritual-training" id="thinking-conducive-to-spiritual-training">Thinking Conducive to Spiritual Training</a></h3>
<p>Thinking is linked to and follows cognition. The process of cognition
begins at the point where a sense base (<em>āyatana</em>) encounters a sense
object (<em>ārammaṇa</em>). At this point consciousness arises (<em>viññāṇa</em>) –
the awareness of a sense object – for example seeing a form, hearing a
sound, or knowing a mental object. When this process is complete it is
called ‘cognition’, or literally, according to the Pali, as ‘contact’
(<em>phassa</em>).</p>
<p>With cognition there arises some form of sensation (<em>vedanā</em>), say of
pleasure and ease, suffering and discomfort, or a neutral feeling.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>
At the same time, there arises perception (<em>saññā</em>) – the naming,
designation, or recognition of the sense object. From here there follows
thinking (<em>vitakka</em>) – thoughts, reflections and deliberations.</p>
<p>This process of cognition is the same, regardless of whether one
encounters and experiences something externally, or whether one thinks
of something and contemplates it in the mind.</p>
<p>Using the act of seeing as an example, this process can be illustrated
as follows (similar to earlier at Figure <a href="six-sense-spheres.html#fig-cognitive-process-simple">The Cognitive Process (Simple Form)</a> in Chapter 2. Six Senses).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Eye (<em>āyatana</em>) +<br />
physical form (<em>ārammaṇa</em>) +<br />
seeing (<em>cakkhu-viññāṇa</em>) =<br />
contact (<em>phassa</em>) →<br />
sensation (<em>vedanā</em>) →<br />
perception (<em>saññā</em>) →<br />
thinking (<em>vitakka</em>)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The act of thinking plays a very important role in determining a
person’s personality and way of life, as well as shaping society as a
whole. Thinking, therefore, is an essential factor in spiritual
training. Thinking, however, is itself determined by various factors and
conditions.</p>
<p>One factor which exerts a powerful influence on thinking is sensation
(<em>vedanā</em>), in particular the feelings of pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, when people contact sense impressions and experience
feelings, unless other factors enter to correct or intercept the
process, these feelings determine the way a person thinks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the feelings are pleasurable or comforting one delights in them;
one wishes to acquire or consume the object (this is craving –
<em>taṇhā</em> – in an affirmative sense).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the feelings are painful or oppressive one is averse to them; one
wishes to escape from or eliminate the object (this is craving in an
adversative sense). {616}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point a person creates elaborate thoughts and ideas about the
sense object acting as the source of that feeling. The object becomes
the focus of a person’s thinking, accompanied by <em>saññā</em> – memories and
perceptions of this object. These proliferations of thought follow the
course of the person’s likes and aversions. The determining factors for
thought are a person’s accumulated proclivities, prejudices, habits,
disposition, and mental defilements (collectively referred to as mental
formations – <em>saṅkhāra</em>). He or she thinks within the confines and
limitations and along the line of these mental formations. Expressions
of speech and physical actions may then follow in the wake of these
thoughts.</p>
<p>Even if these thoughts are not expressed as outward actions, they still
have an impact on a person’s mind. They limit and constrict the mind and
create various forms of mental distress, agitation, disturbance,
depression, and confusion. Thoughts related to specific subjects can
create mental bias and distortion, resulting in a failure to see things
according to the truth, while some thoughts may be tainted by greed or
hostility.</p>
<p>In the case that one experiences neutral sensations – neither
pleasurable nor painful – if one is not skilled at reflection and
allows oneself to remain under their influence, one’s thinking will be
aimless and incoherent or completely stifled. This is an unfavourable
and unwholesome situation, leading to problems and greater suffering.</p>
<p>The main factors of this process can be illustrated thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Contact (<em>phassa</em>) →<br />
sensation (<em>vedanā</em>) →<br />
craving, both affirmative and adversative (<em>taṇhā</em>) →<br />
suffering (<em>dukkha</em>)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For most people this process of compounding problems occurs almost
continually. In a single day it may occur repeatedly and countlessly.
The life of a person lacking spiritual training tends to be dominated
and determined by this way of thinking. It requires no intelligence,
understanding, or special capability. It is the most basic way in which
a human being operates. And the more a person has accumulated the habit
of thinking in this way, the easier this process unfolds automatically,
as if stuck in a pre-established rut.</p>
<p>Because this process functions without any guidance by mindfulness and
wisdom, it generates ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>). Rather than being conducive
to solving problems, it creates more problems and increases suffering.
It is antithetical to spiritual training. Technically, it is thus
referred to as the ‘mode of conditionality leading to suffering’.</p>
<p>The basic attribute of this way of thinking is that it serves to gratify
craving. In sum it can be referred to as the ‘process of thinking that
panders to craving’, ‘thinking that causes problems’, or simply as the
‘cycle of suffering’.</p>
<p>The beginning of spiritual training begins with the application of
mindfulness and wisdom. Here, a person no longer allows this
aforementioned process of thinking or mode of conditionality to function
unabated and unchecked. One uses mindfulness, wisdom, and other
spiritual factors to interrupt or reduce the flow of this way of
thinking, resulting in a severance of the cycle or a transformation and
altered course of thinking. One begins to be liberated – to no longer
be enslaved by this process of thinking. {617}</p>
<p>At first, an altered course of thinking may result from views or
traditional ways of thinking transmitted by external sources, say by
other people or social institutions, to which one adheres out of faith.
Generally speaking the most such external instruction can do is to deter
or restrain one from blindly following a course of thinking pandering to
craving, or perhaps it can provide one with an alternative fixed pattern
of thinking. But it does not necessarily lead to a progressive,
independent way of thinking. If the instruction is exceptional, however,
it can generate the kind of faith that leads people to think for
themselves.</p>
<p>An example of instruction that leads to a strictly prescribed,
unyielding form of faith, and is not a vehicle for further
contemplation, is to have others believe that everything in the world is
governed and controlled by some divine being or occurs randomly or by
accident. If one believes in such teachings, all one has to do is wait
for the will of God or leave everything up to fate. One need not
investigate or reflect on things.</p>
<p>Conversely, an example of instruction that generates a kind of faith
leading to contemplation is to have others believe that all things exist
according causes and conditions. If one believes this then no matter
what happens one will investigate and probe into the underlying causes
and conditions, and one will develop an increased knowledge and
understanding.</p>
<p>Wholesome thinking and contemplation induced by a faith in external
instruction begins with wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>). In other
words, skilful instruction generates a faith leading to wise reflection.</p>
<p>With the arising of wise reflection, spiritual training has begun. From
this point a person applies and develops wisdom, which helps to solve
problems and is the path to the cessation of suffering. In a nutshell,
thinking that supports and promotes wisdom <em>is</em> spiritual training.</p>
<p>Wise reflection plays an especially important role by preventing feeling
(<em>vedanā</em>) from producing craving (<em>taṇhā</em>). When one applies wise
reflection, one experiences feeling but without it leading to craving.
And when there is no craving, one does not create fanciful ideas
(’mental proliferation’) subject to the power of craving.</p>
<p>When one severs thinking processes pandering to craving, skilful,
systematic reflection leads to the path of wisdom development and to the
end of suffering. The two kinds of thinking can be illustrated as shown
on
Figure <a href="#fig-two-kinds-of-thinking">Two Kinds of Thinking</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">Two Kinds of Thinking</span><a id="fig-two-kinds-of-thinking"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/two-kinds-of-thinking.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>In any case, for ordinary people, even if they have begun a spiritual
training, these two ways of thinking arise alternately, and one way of
thinking may interfere with the other. For example, the first process
may unfold until it reaches craving, but then wise reflection steps in
to cut off the process and steer it in a new direction. Or the latter
process may reach the stage of wisdom, yet craving in a new guise
hijacks the process. It can thus occur that the fruits of wisdom are
corrupted to serve the interests of craving. {618}</p>
<p>When those persons who have completed spiritual training think, they
apply analytical reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>). When they are not
thinking they abide mindfully in the present moment, that is, they are
attentive to those activities in which they are engaged.</p>
<p>To say that one applies analytical reflection when one thinks also
implies that one applies mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), because wise reflection
is a source of nourishment for mindfulness. When thinking proceeds in a
systematic, purposeful way, attention does not stray or drift aimlessly.
Mindfulness then functions to keep attention on the tasks at hand.</p>
<p>Analytical reflection is thus a key factor in spiritual training,
connected to the essential stage of wisdom development. It is required
for living a virtuous life, helping to solve problems and acting as a
refuge for people.</p>
<p>In the gradual process of wisdom development, wise reflection is part of
a stage beyond faith, because at this stage a person begins to think
independently from others.</p>
<p>Within the system of spiritual training, wise reflection is an internal
factor, connected to the development and application of thought. It can
be defined as a proper method of thinking, methodical thinking, or
analytical thinking, and it has the following attributes: it prevents
one from looking at things superficially; it leads to self-reliance; and
it leads to liberation, freedom from suffering, true peace, and pure
wisdom, which are the highest goals of Buddhism.</p>
<p>The preceding material has presented a general introduction to the two
initial factors of spiritual training: the utterances of others
(<em>paratoghosa</em>), which can also be described as having a virtuous friend
(<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>), which is an external factor and a matter dealing with
faith; and wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), which is an internal
factor and a matter dealing with wisdom.</p>
<p>From here on in this chapter the focus will be solely on wise
reflection, to elucidate the methods of thinking distinctive to
Buddha-Dhamma. {619}</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#definition-of-wise-reflection" id="definition-of-wise-reflection">Definition of Wise Reflection</a></h2>
<p>The compound term <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em> is comprised of the two words
<em>yoniso</em> and <em>manasikāra</em>.</p>
<p><em>Yoniso</em> is derived from the word <em>yoni</em> (’origin’, ‘place of birth’,
‘womb’) and is variously translated as ‘cause’, ‘root’, ‘source’,
‘wisdom’, ‘method’, ‘means’, or ‘path’. (See
Note <a href="#note-yoniso-path">Yoniso: A Means and a Path</a>)</p>
<p><em>Manasikāra</em> is translated as ‘mental activity’, ‘thinking’,
‘consideration’, ‘reflection’, ‘directing attention’, or
‘contemplation’. (See
Note <a href="#note-manasikara-synonyms">Synonyms of Manasikāra</a>)</p>
<p>As a compound the term <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em> is traditionally defined as
‘skilfully directing attention’. The commentaries and sub-commentaries
elaborate on this definition and explain the nuances of this term by
presenting various synonyms, as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Upāya-manasikāra</em>: ‘methodical reflection’; to think or reflect by
using proper means or methods; systematic thinking. This refers to
methodical thinking that enables one to realize and exist in harmony
with the truth, and to penetrate the nature and characteristics of
all phenomena. {622}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Patha-manasikāra</em>: ‘suitable reflection’; to think following a
distinct course or in a proper way; to think sequentially and in
order; to think systematically. This refers to thinking in a
well-organized way, e.g. in line with cause and effect; to not think
in a confused, disorderly way; to not at one moment be preoccupied
by one thing and then in the next moment jump to something else,
unable to sustain a precise, well-defined sequence of thought. This
factor also includes the ability to guide thinking in a correct
direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kāraṇa-manasikāra</em>: ‘reasoned thinking’; analytical thinking;
investigative thinking; rational thinking. This refers to inquiry
into the relationship and sequence of causes and conditions; to
contemplate and search for the original causes of things, in order
to arrive at their root or source, which has resulted in a gradual
chain of events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Uppādaka-manasikāra</em>: ‘effective thinking’; to apply thinking in a
purposeful way, in order to yield desired results. This refers to
thinking and reflection that generates wholesome qualities, e.g.:
thoughts that rouse effort; an ability to think in a way that
dispels fear and anger; and contemplations which support mindfulness
or which strengthen and stabilize the mind.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These four definitions describe various attributes of the kind of
thought referred to as ‘wise reflection’ (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>). At any
one time, wise reflection may contain all or some of these attributes.
These four definitions may be summarized in brief as ‘methodical
thinking’, ‘systematic thinking’, ‘analytical thinking’, or ‘thinking
inducing wholesomeness’. It is challenging, however, to come up with a
single definition or translation for <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>. Most
translations will only capture limited nuances of this term and are not
comprehensive. The alternative is to give a lengthy definition, as
presented above.</p>
<p>The difficulty of translating this term notwithstanding, there are
prominent attributes of this way of thinking which can be used to
represent all the other attributes and which can be translated in brief,
for example: ‘methodical thinking’, ‘skilful thinking’, ‘analytical
thinking’, and ‘investigative thinking’. Once one has gained a thorough
understanding of this Pali term, it is convenient to rely on a concise
translation like ‘wise reflection’, ‘systematic reflection’, or ‘careful
attention’. (See
Note <a href="#note-yoniso-translation">Traslation of Yoniso Manasikāra</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Traslation of Yoniso Manasikāra</span><a id="note-yoniso-translation"></a></p>

reflection, critical reflection, analytical reflection, etc. [Trans.:

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned the relationship between the internal factor of
wise reflection and the external factor of instruction by others or
virtuous friends. Here, let us focus more closely on how a virtuous
friend, by relying on the principle of faith, can help those people who
are unskilled at thinking for themselves and applying wise reflection.</p>
<p>In respect to the first three attributes of wise reflection described
above, virtuous friends are only able to point out or throw light on
specific truths, but practitioners must contemplate and gain
understanding by themselves. When it comes to the stage of true
understanding, faith is inadequate.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> In regard to these three
attributes, faith is thus extremely limited. {623}</p>
<p>In respect to the fourth attribute (reflection generating wholesome
qualities), however, faith plays a powerful role. For example, some
people are weak and easily daunted or think in irrational and harmful
ways. If a virtuous friend is able to establish faith in such people,
this will be very helpful for them. He or she may inspire and encourage
them by using skilful means. Having said this, there are some people who
are naturally endowed with wise reflection and are able to think for
themselves. In discouraging or distressing situations they are able to
effectively motivate themselves and think of ways to address the
problem.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if one has evil friends or applies unwise attention,
despite finding oneself in good circumstances and encountering good
things, one is likely to think or act in bad ways. For instance, when
discovering a pleasant, secluded place, a bad person may think of it as
a suitable place to commit a crime. In a similar vein, some people are
highly suspicious – when they see someone else smile, they think that
they are being ridiculed or insulted.</p>
<p>If one allows this course of thinking to proceed unimpeded, unwise
attention will nourish and strengthen such unwholesome states of mind.
For example, a person who habitually sees things in a negative light
will begin to see others as adversaries. Similarly, a person who is
habitually afraid and sees others as thinking ill of him may develop a
mental disorder of paranoia.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Depending on either wise reflection or unwise reflection, the same
subject matter may result in very different behaviour for different
people. For example, one person may think of death with improper
attention and consequently experience fear, depression, apathy, or
confusion. Another person may think of death with wise reflection and
thus appreciate the need to abstain from unwholesome actions. He or she
will be calm, heedful, and ardent, hastening to perform good deeds.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>In terms of insight into reality, wise reflection is not wisdom itself,
but rather a condition for the arising of wisdom, that is, wise
reflection generates right view. The Milindapañhā describes the
difference between reflection and wisdom thus:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, animals such as goats, sheep, cows, buffalo, camels, and
donkeys possess a form of reflection (<em>manasikāra</em> – ‘mental
application’), but they do not possess wisdom (nor is their
reflection ‘analytical’ – <em>yoniso</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, <em>manasikāra</em> has the characteristic of contemplation and
reflection, whereas wisdom (<em>paññā</em>) has the characteristic of
severing. <em>Manasikāra</em> gathers together and submits ideas to wisdom,
which is then able to eliminate mental defilement, similar to a man
grasping an ear of rice by his left hand, enabling him to
successfully harvest it with a sickle held in his right hand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this interpretation, <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em> is a kind of mental
engagement (<em>manasikāra</em>) leading to an application and development of
wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> {624}</p>
<p>The Papañcasūdanī states that unwise attention (<em>ayoniso-manasikāra</em>) is
the root source of the round of rebirth (<em>vaṭṭa</em>), causing beings to
accumulate problems and to swim around in suffering. This text also
explains that, when it is allowed to prosper, unwise attention increases
both ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>) and the craving for becoming (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>).
With the arising of ignorance the cycle of Dependent Origination begins,
starting with ignorance acting as the condition for volitional
formations (<em>saṅkhāra</em>), and completed with the arising of the whole
mass of suffering. The beginning of the cycle of Dependent Origination
can also be designated by the arising of craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), starting
with craving acting as a condition for grasping, and similarly completed
with the mass of suffering.</p>
<p>Conversely, wise reflection is the root cause for the cycle of ‘turning
away’ (<em>vivaṭṭa</em>), enabling one to escape from the whirlpool of
suffering and to truly solve problems. With the arising of wise
reflection a person begins to practise according to the Eightfold Path,
with right view as the leading factor. Right view here is equivalent to
true knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>). With the arising of true knowledge, ignorance
ceases. With the end of ignorance the cessation cycle (<em>nirodha-vāra</em>)
of Dependent Origination is set in operation, leading gradually to the
cessation of suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> These processes can be illustrated thus:</p>
<p>Round of rebirth (<em>vaṭṭa</em>):</p>
<p>Unwise reflection (<em>ayoniso-manasikāra</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>) →<br />
volitional formations (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) ...<br />
aging, death, sorrow, lamentation =<br />
the arising of suffering.</em></p>
<p>Craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) →<br />
grasping (<em>upādāna</em>) ...<br />
aging, death, sorrow, lamentation =<br />
the arising of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cycle of ‘turning away’ (<em>vivaṭṭa</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) →<br />
cultivation of the Path (<em>magga-bhāvanā</em>):<br />
right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>) =<br />
true knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>) →<br />
the cessation of ignorance →<br />
the cessation of volitional formations ...<br />
the cessation of suffering.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em> has a wide range of meaning, including
thinking concerned with moral issues and thinking in line with virtuous
and truthful principles which one has studied and understood. Basic
levels of contemplation which do not require a profound degree of wisdom
include: thoughts of amicability, thoughts of lovingkindness, thoughts
of generosity and assistance, and thoughts of generating inner strength,
determination, and courage. Some contemplations, however, require
refined and subtle degrees of wisdom, for example an analysis of
subsidiary factors or an investigation into causes and conditions.</p>
<p>Because the meaning of wise reflection is so comprehensive, everyone is
capable of applying it, especially elementary levels of contemplation.
All people need to do is direct their course of thinking in a wholesome
direction, corresponding to teachings they have received and ideas they
have nurtured. This basic form of wise reflection helps to generate
mundane right view and is greatly influenced by faith, which comes about
through the words of others (<em>paratoghosa</em>), including one’s education,
culture, and the presence of virtuous friends. Faith acts as an anchor
for the mind and an internal force. When a person cognizes a sense
object or encounters a particular situation, the course of his or her
thinking is directed by the force of faith, as if faith has already dug
a channel for thinking to go. {625}</p>
<p>For this reason the Buddha stated that (correct) faith is the
nourishment for wise reflection.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> External instruction from virtuous
friends, which uses faith as a channel, is able to gradually increase
understanding and introduce a person to new ideas, for example by way of
consultation and by asking questions to clear up doubts.</p>
<p>When it is applied repeatedly and nourished by faith, proper reflection
develops and becomes more agile, deepening wisdom. When one contemplates
and sees that the teachings one has received are truly correct and
beneficial, one becomes more confident and faith increases. In this way,
wise reflection enhances faith.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup> It urges people to make greater
effort in their studies, until eventually their own reflections lead
them to realization and deliverance.</p>
<p>Here, a person’s spiritual practice relies on an integration between
internal and external factors. Wholesome influence from external sources
is implied in the phrase: ‘Be your own refuge, with no one else as your
refuge.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup> The Buddha did not reject external influences. Indeed,
external influences and the quality of faith are extremely important,
but the key determining factor lies within, that is, wise reflection.</p>
<p>The more one is able to apply wise reflection, the less one relies on
external factors. Similarly, if someone does not apply wise reflection
at all, any amount of help from virtuous friends is in vain.</p>
<p>As most students of Buddhism know, mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) is a vital
factor that is required for every activity. The problem arises, however,
of how to establish mindfulness in time and, once it is established, how
to sustain it in a consistent, continuous way so that it is not broken
and does not slip away.</p>
<p>In this context, there are teachings which explain how wise reflection
nourishes mindfulness, assisting the establishment and the uninterrupted
flow of mindfulness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>If one possesses systematic, coherent, and effective reflection, one is
able to sustain mindfulness consistently. If one is unable to reflect
properly, however, or if one’s thinking is ineffectual or aimless,
mindfulness will keep slipping away and one will be unable to sustain
it. It is neither correct nor possible to truly compel or constrain
mindfulness. The correct course is to nourish mindfulness and to
generate its supportive conditions. If these conditions are present,
mindfulness arises – this is part of a natural process. One thus needs
to act in accord with this process.</p>
<p>The function of wise reflection is to cut off ignorance and craving (or
in an affirmative sense, it summons wisdom and wholesome qualities).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when a person encounters a sense object, the process
of thinking begins immediately. At this point two distinct forces vie
with one another:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If ignorance and craving are able to seize control of thinking, the
thought process will be subject to these factors and shaped by
mental formations based on likes and dislikes and on pre-established
concepts and ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If wise reflection is able to bar and cut off ignorance and craving,
it will lead thinking in a correct direction, resulting in a thought
process free from these negative factors. The corrupted thought
process is replaced by the process of knowing and seeing
(<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>) or of true knowledge and liberation
(<em>vijjā-vimutti</em>). {626}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally speaking, when ordinary, unawakened beings encounter a sense
object, their thinking follows the course of ignorance and craving. They
overlay the experience with their likes and dislikes, or with their
pre-established ideas. This is the point at which thoughts connected to
that experience or sense object begin to be shaped and moulded by
ignorance and craving, a process which occurs because of a person’s
accumulated habitual tendencies.</p>
<p>To be influenced by ignorance and craving in one’s thinking is to see
things as one wants them to be or not to be. One’s thinking is bound by
personal attachments and aversions. This results in an incorrect
discernment of things, in prejudices based on preferences and aversions,
in misunderstanding, and in distorted conceptions. Moreover, it is a
cause for confusion, listlessness, loneliness, despondency, fear,
gratification and subsequent disappointment, stress, and frustration,
all of which are various forms of mental affliction.</p>
<p>Reflecting wisely entails seeing things according to the truth or
according to causal relationships, not according to ignorance and
craving. In other words, one sees things according to their own nature,
not according to one’s wishes and desires.</p>
<p>When unawakened persons experience something, their thoughts immediately
align themselves with likes and dislikes. The function of wise
reflection is to cut off this process and to seize the active role. It
then directs the course of thinking in a pure, systematic direction, by
contemplating according to causes and conditions. The result is that one
understands the truth and generates wholesome states, or at the very
least one responds to things in the most appropriate way.</p>
<p>Wise reflection allows people to make good use of thinking, to be a
master of their own thoughts, to call upon thinking in order to solve
problems and to live at ease. This is the opposite to unwise reflection,
which allows thoughts to manipulate and enslave the mind, to drag people
into difficulty, oppress them in various ways, and take away their
independence. Note also that in the course of wise reflection,
mindfulness and clear comprehension are constant factors inherent in the
process, because wise reflection constantly nourishes these factors.</p>
<p>In sum, wise reflection cuts off ignorance and craving. These two
negative qualities always appear in tandem, although in some cases
ignorance is prominent and craving unpronounced, while at other times
craving is dominant and ignorance concealed.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup> Given this fact, it is
possible to present two definitions for wise reflection, according to
the dominant role of either ignorance or craving: wise reflection is a
form of thinking that cuts off ignorance; or it is a form of thinking
that cuts off craving. The distinction is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When ignorance is dominant, thinking gets stuck on and revolves
around a single theme in a confused and disconnected way. One does
not know which direction to go, or else one’s thoughts are
incoherent, disordered, and irrational, for example in the case of
someone who is caught in fear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When craving is dominant, thinking inclines in the direction of
likes and dislikes, preferences and aversions, or attachment and
revulsion. One is preoccupied with those things one likes or
dislikes, and one’s thinking is shaped in accord with pleasure and
displeasure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This distinction notwithstanding, on a profound level ignorance is the
source of craving, and craving reinforces ignorance. Therefore, if one
is to eliminate all affliction and unwholesomeness completely, one must
go to the source and eliminate ignorance. {627}</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#ways-of-reflecting-wisely" id="ways-of-reflecting-wisely">Ways of Reflecting Wisely</a></h2>
<p>The ways of reflecting wisely here refers to the practical application
of <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>. Although there are many methods for applying
wise reflection, technically speaking they are divided into two main
categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wise reflection aiming directly at the cutting off or elimination of
ignorance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wise reflection aiming at cutting off or reducing craving.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally speaking, the first method is necessary for the final stages
of Dhamma practice, because it gives rise to an understanding according
to the truth, which is a requirement for awakening. The latter method is
most often used during preliminary stages of practice, with the purpose
of building a foundation for virtue or of cultivating virtue, in order
to be prepared for more advanced stages. This method is limited to
subduing mental defilement. Many methods of applying wise reflection,
however, can be used for both benefits simultaneously: for eliminating
ignorance and for reducing craving.</p>
<p>The chief methods for applying wise reflection contained in the Pali
Canon can be classified as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The method of investigating causes and conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method of analyzing component factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method of reflecting in accord with the three universal
characteristics (<em>sāmañña-lakkhaṇa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method of reflecting in accord with the Four Noble Truths
(reflection used to solve problems).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method of reflecting on the relationship between the goals
(<em>attha</em>) and the principles (<em>dhamma</em>) of things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method of reflecting on the advantages and disadvantages of
things, and on the escape from them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method of reflecting on the true and counterfeit value of
things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method of reflection in order to rouse wholesome qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method of reflection by dwelling in the present moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method of reflection corresponding to analytic discussion
(<em>vibhajja-vāda</em>). {628}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="header" href="#investigation-of-causes-and-conditions" id="investigation-of-causes-and-conditions">Investigation of Causes and Conditions</a></h3>
<p>The method of investigating causes and conditions refers to a
contemplation of phenomena in order to ascertain the truth, or to a
contemplation of dilemmas in order to find a solution by examining
various interrelated causal factors. It can also be described as the way
of thinking in line with ‘specific conditionality’ (<em>idappaccayatā</em>) or
according to the teaching on Dependent Origination (<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>).
This is a fundamental form of wise reflection, and it is sometimes
referred to when describing the Buddha’s awakening.</p>
<p>This form of reflection is not restricted to beginning at the results
and then investigating the causes and conditions. In the way of thinking
in line with specific conditionality it is also possible to begin with a
cause and then trace its results, or to select any point in the middle
of a process and then track either forwards to the end result or
backwards to the source.</p>
<p>In the Pali Canon this form of wise reflection is described as follows:</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li><strong>1.</strong> Reflections on mutual conditionality: here, a noble disciple
reflects wisely on how all conditioned things are interdependent,
enabling them to exist:</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, it would be better for the uninstructed worldling to take this
body composed of the four great elements as a ‘self’; but for him to
take the mind as a ‘self’ is truly unsuitable. For what reason?
Because this body composed of the four great elements is seen standing
for one year, for two years, for three, four, five, or ten years, for
twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty years, for a hundred years, or even
longer. But that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘mentality’ or
‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and
by night.</p>
<p>Monks, in regard to that collection of great elements, the instructed
noble disciple attends closely and carefully to dependent origination
thus: ‘When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this,
that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with
the cessation of this, that ceases.’ In dependence on contact acting
as a basis for pleasant feeling, a pleasant feeling arises. With the
cessation of that contact acting as a basis for pleasant feeling, that
pleasant feeling arising dependent on that contact ... ceases and
subsides. In dependence on contact acting as a basis for painful
feeling, a painful feeling arises. With the cessation of that contact
acting as a basis for painful feeling, that painful feeling ... ceases
and subsides. In dependence on contact acting as a basis for neutral
feeling, a neutral feeling arises. With the cessation of that contact
acting as a basis for neutral feeling, that neutral feeling ... ceases
and subsides.</p>
<p>Monks, just as heat is generated and fire is produced from the
friction of two fire-sticks, but with the separation and laying aside
of the sticks the resultant heat ceases and subsides; so too in
dependence on contact acting as a basis for pleasant feeling, a
pleasant feeling arises, and with the cessation of that contact acting
as a basis for pleasant feeling, that pleasant feeling arising
dependent on that contact ... ceases and subsides....<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup> {629}</p>

Origination.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#analysis-of-component-factors" id="analysis-of-component-factors">Analysis of Component Factors</a></h3>
<p>The analysis of component factors, or the elaboration on a specific
subject matter, is another form of reflection which aims to generate an
understanding of things as they truly are.</p>
<p>This form of contemplation is most often used to recognize the true
insubstantiality or selflessness of all things, in order to give up
clinging to conventions and designations (<em>sammati-paññatti</em>). In
particular, this refers to a contemplation of beings or people as
existing merely as a collection of assorted aggregates (<em>khandha</em>), each
of which exists dependent on subsidiary conditional factors. This form
of reflection is conducive to seeing the ‘selfless’ nature of things
(<em>anattā</em>).</p>
<p>A clear discernment of the selfless nature of things, however, normally
requires the simultaneous participation by the previous kind of
reflection (investigative reflection) and/or the following kind of
reflection (reflection in accord with the three characteristics; see
below). Through careful analysis one sees how the five aggregates are
interdependent and subject to related causes and conditions; they are
not truly independent. Moreover, these aggregates and conditional
factors all proceed according to natural laws, that is, they exist in a
perpetual state of rise and decay; they are unstable, unenduring, and
impermanent.</p>
<p>If one is unable to accurately see this rising and ceasing of phenomena
– their conditionality and their oppression by various factors – by
way of investigative reflection described above, which can be a
difficult task, one can reflect on these attributes as universal
characteristics of all things, which is encompassed in the third kind of
contemplation below. In the Pali Canon this second kind of wise
reflection is mentioned together with the third kind.</p>
<p>The commentaries, however, which are aligned with later Abhidhamma
texts, prefer to distinguish this second kind of reflection, and they
classify it is a mode of detailed analysis (<em>vibhajja-vidhi</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup>
Furthermore, they tend to begin with a basic analysis by focusing on
mentality and corporeality (<em>nāma-rūpa</em>), rather than immediately
analyzing the five aggregates.</p>
<p>This kind of reflection is not restricted to analyzing and
distinguishing various factors, but also includes classification and
categorization. The emphasis, however, is given on analysis and it is
thus referred to as <em>vibhajja</em> (’detailed analysis’). {630}</p>
<p>In the traditional practice of insight meditation as described in the
commentaries, the basic analysis of mentality and corporeality is
referred to as ‘analysis of mind and body’ (<em>nāmarūpa-vavatthāna</em>) or
‘contemplation of mind and body’ (<em>nāmarūpa-pariggaha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup> Here, one
does not look at people according to their conventional names and
designations, of being ‘them’ or ‘us’, ‘Mr. A’ or ‘Mrs. B’. Instead one
sees them as a combination of physical and mental phenomena. One
determines each of the component factors in such a way: ‘This is
material form, this is mind’, ‘material form has these specific
characteristics, mental phenomena have these specific characteristics’,
‘this factor has this kind of attribute and is thus classified as
“form”, while this factor has another kind of attribute and is thus
classified as “mind”.’</p>
<p>An analysis of human beings reveals only mind-and-body, or material and
mental phenomena. Having trained in such discernment, or gaining skill
at such reflection, when encountering living beings and other objects,
one will see them as simply a collection of mental and physical
elements. They are merely natural phenomena, which are empty of any kind
of true substance or permanent self. One’s course of thinking helps to
prevent one from being misguided or from overly attaching to
conventional reality.</p>
<p>Examples in the Pali Canon of this kind reflection are as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Just as, with an assemblage of parts,<br />
The word ‘wagon’ is used,<br />
So, when the aggregates exist,<br />
There is the convention ‘a being’.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 135.</em></p>
<p>Friends, just as when a space is enclosed by timber, twine, clay and
thatch, it comes to be called a ‘house’, so too, when a space is
enclosed by bones and sinews, flesh and skin, it comes to be called a
‘body’ (rūpa).</p>
<p><em>M. I. 190.</em></p>
<p>Monks, suppose that this river Ganges was carrying along a great lump
of foam. A man with good sight would inspect it, examine it, and
carefully investigate it.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup> By inspecting it, examining it, and
carefully investigating it, it would appear to him to be void, empty
and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a lump of
foam?</p>
<p>So too, monks, whatever kind of material form there is, whether past,
future, or present ... far or near: a bhikkhu inspects it, examines
it, and carefully investigates it. By inspecting it, examining it, and
carefully investigating it, it would appear to him to be void, empty,
insubstantial. For what substance could there be in material
form?<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Form is like a lump of foam,<br />
Feeling like a water bubble;<br />
Perception is like a mirage,<br />
Volitions like a plantain trunk,<br />
And consciousness like an illusion,<br />
So explained the Kinsman of the Sun.<br />
However one may consider,<br />
And carefully investigate [these five aggregates],<br />
They are but void and empty. {631}</em></p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#reflection-in-line-with-universal-characteristics" id="reflection-in-line-with-universal-characteristics">Reflection in Line with Universal Characteristics</a></h3>
<p>Reflection in line with universal characteristics, or reflective
discernment of natural truths, refers to a clear understanding of things
as they are: an understanding of how things exist, and must exist,
according to their own nature. The focus of this reflection is on living
beings and things that ordinary people are aware of, that is,
conditioned things – things arising from and shaped by causes and
conditions and subject to conditionality.</p>
<p>One of these natural truths is the law of impermanence, that all
conditioned things, once they are arisen, must cease; they are
inconstant, unstable, unenduring, and impermanent (<em>anicca</em>).</p>
<p>Likewise, all conditional factors, both internal and external,
perpetually arise and cease. Their interaction with one another causes
conflict and friction, which results in conditioned things being under
stress. They are unable to maintain an original state of existence and
they are subject to alteration and disintegration, a truth which is
referred to as <em>dukkha</em>.</p>
<p>The very nature of conditioned phenomena means that they do not belong
to anyone, they are not subject to anyone’s wishes or desires, and they
cannot be truly owned or controlled by anyone. Similarly, they possess
no ‘soul’ or ‘essence’, either internal or external, which is able to
dictate or rule over them. They exist according to their own nature;
they exist according to causes and conditions, not according to anyone’s
will. This is referred to as the truth of ‘nonself’ (<em>anattā</em>).</p>
<p>The reflection here entails an acknowledgement of how all things one
engages with exist equally as natural phenomena; they are conditioned
formations, existing dependent on conditional factors.</p>
<p>The reflection in line with universal characteristics can be divided
into two stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first stage includes a discernment and acknowledgement of the
truth. At this stage one relates to things in harmony with nature.
Such conduct is marked by wisdom and an inner freedom; one is not
bound by things.</p>
<p>Even if one encounters unpleasant or undesirable circumstances, one
is able to reflect on how these things, or these situations, proceed
in line with a natural course and exist according to causes and
conditions. By thinking in this way one begins to accept one’s
situation; one is consequently released from suffering, or at the
very least one’s suffering abates.</p>
<p>When one possesses greater mental agility, all one needs to do in
such challenging situations is to establish mindfulness and call to
mind: ‘I will see things according to the truth, not how I want them
to be.’ By doing this one’s suffering will decrease immediately,
because one begins to be released – one does not subject oneself to
stress. Indeed, one does not create a sense of self that is subject
to stress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second stage includes managing and resolving things in line with
causal factors. Here one acts with insight, wisdom, and freedom.</p>
<p>When one acknowledges the conditional nature of things and one
wishes for things to be a particular way, one studies and
understands the causes and conditions required for things to reach a
desired result. One then acts and deals with things at their
specific conditional factors. When one fulfils the necessary
conditions, irrespective of whether one desires the result or not,
it will occur automatically. Similarly, if these necessary
conditions are lacking, the result will fail, regardless of one’s
desires. In sum, one deals with things by way of knowledge and in
line with conditional factors, not through willpower or desire.
{632}</p>
<p>In terms of Dhamma practice, all one needs to do is acknowledge
one’s wishes, determine the relevant causes and conditions, and then
deal with matters at the point of these conditional factors. By
practising in this way one extricates oneself from problems; one is
not bound. One does not allow one’s desires to lead one into
oppression (one does not allow one’s desires to create a fixed sense
of identity). One both acts directly in line with causes and
conditions, and allows things to proceed according to such causes
and conditions. This way of practice is both the most effectual and
is also free from suffering.</p>
<p>This second stage of reflection in line with universal
characteristics is related to the fourth kind of reflection
described below, that is, the fourth kind of reflection takes over
from the third.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the traditional practice of insight development (<em>vipassanā</em>), which
was developed into a formal system described in the commentaries, the
teaching on the seven forms of purity (<em>visuddhi</em>) is used as the master
template.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup> In this context, the commentaries use the list of
different forms of knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>) described in the Paṭisambhidāmagga
as a set of criteria,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup> and maintain the basic contemplation of
phenomena, of separating them into ‘mind-and-body’ (<em>nāma-rūpa</em>).</p>
<p>According to this teaching, the development of insight is set down as a
system containing clearly defined, progressive steps. The three kinds of
reflection mentioned so far are included in this system, in which they
are combined into a distinct group of affiliated methods of reflection.
The order in which they are presented, however, differs from the order
presented above:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first step entails analytical reasoning or an investigation into
component factors (method #2 described above). Here, one
distinguishes between mental and material phenomena: one determines
what is mind and what is body, what are the different kinds of
material and mental phenomena, and what sort of attributes these
distinct phenomena possess. This step is referred to as
‘contemplation of name-and-form’ (<em>nāmarūpa-pariggaha</em>), ‘analysis
of name-and-form’ (<em>nāmarūpa-vavatthāna</em>), ‘division of
name-and-form’ (<em>nāmarūpa-pariccheda</em>), or ‘division of formations’
(<em>saṅkhāra-pariccheda</em>). It is classified as ‘purity of views’
(<em>diṭṭhi-visuddhi</em>) – the third of the seven kinds of purity.</p>
<p>The objective here, however, is primarily on understanding and
distinguishing phenomena or component factors – to know which
things one encounters are comprised of materiality and which are
comprised of mentality – rather than emphasizing analysis in
general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second step entails an investigation of conditionality (method
#1 described above). Here, one searches for and contemplates the
causes and conditions of material and mental phenomena in various
ways, for example: to contemplate in line with the teaching of
Dependent Origination; to contemplate ignorance, craving, grasping,
volitional actions (<em>kamma</em>), and nourishment (<em>āhāra</em>); to
contemplate in accord with the cognitive process (say by
contemplating how eye-consciousness depends on the eye and material
forms); and to contemplate according to the cycles of volitional
actions (<em>kamma</em>) and their results (<em>vipāka</em>). All of these
contemplations are part of the contemplation on Dependent
Origination; they simply separate and highlight different aspects of
this teaching.</p>
<p>This step is referred to as ‘contemplation of the conditions for
name-and-form’ (<em>nāmarūpapaccaya-pariggaha</em>), or in short an
‘analysis of conditions’ (<em>paccaya-pariggaha</em>). When this
contemplation is complete, it gives rise to an understanding
referred to as ‘knowledge of the relationship of things’
(<em>dhammaṭṭhiti-ñāṇa</em>), ‘knowledge according to reality’
(<em>yathābhūta-ñāṇa</em>), or ‘right vision’ (<em>sammā-dassana</em>). This step
is classified as ‘purity of knowledge leading to the end of doubt’
(<em>kaṅkhāvitaraṇa-visuddhi</em>) – the fourth of the seven kinds of
purity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third step entails a thorough understanding of nature or a
reflection in line with universal characteristics (method #3
described above). Here, one contemplates mind-and-body, or
conditioned phenomena, according to the teaching on the Three
Characteristics. One sees things as impermanent and unstable
(<em>anicca</em>), subject to the stress of conditioning factors
(<em>dukkha</em>), and as nonself (<em>anattā</em>) – they do not exist as
independent entities, they are ultimately insubstantial, and they
cannot be truly owned by anyone or controlled by way of desire.</p>
<p>This step is referred to as ‘investigative knowledge’
(<em>sammasana-ñāṇa</em>). It is the beginning of ‘purity of knowledge
regarding Path and not-path (<em>maggāmaggañāṇadassana-visuddhi</em>) –
the fifth of the seven kinds of purity. {633}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following passages from the Pali Canon describe the joint
application of the second and third kinds of reflection mentioned above
(the method of analyzing component factors and the method of reflecting
in accord with universal characteristics):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, attend carefully (yoniso-manasikāra) to form, and recognize the
impermanence of form as it really is.... Attend carefully to feeling,
and recognize the impermanence of feeling as it really is.... Attend
carefully to perception, and recognize the impermanence of perception
as it really is.... Attend carefully to volitional formations, and
recognize the impermanence of volitional formations as they really
are.... Attend carefully to consciousness, and recognize the
impermanence of consciousness as it really is.</p>
<p><em>S. III. 52.</em></p>
<p>An instructed bhikkhu should carefully attend to the five aggregates
subject to clinging as impermanent, as oppressed by conditioning
factors ... as nonself.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. III. 169.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The following passage describes an investigation of conditionality
combined with a reflection in line with universal characteristics. The
objective of this joint contemplation is to gain a thorough
understanding of reality, to realize mental freedom, and to be free from
suffering:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, dwell with yourselves as a sanctuary, with yourselves as a
refuge, with no other refuge; with the Dhamma as a sanctuary, with the
Dhamma as a refuge, with no other refuge. When you dwell with
yourselves as a refuge ... with the Dhamma as a refuge, with no other
refuge, you should reflect wisely thus: ‘From what are sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair born? What is their source?’</p>
<p>Monks, from what are sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair
born? What is their source? Here, the uninstructed worldling, who does
not associate with the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined
in their Dhamma, who does not associate with superior persons and is
unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or
self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. That
form of his changes and alters. With the change and alteration of
form, there arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair.</p>
<p>He regards feeling as self ... perception as self ... volitional
formations as self ... consciousness as self.... With the change and
alteration of consciousness, there arise in him sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair.</p>
<p>But a monk who has understood the impermanence of form ... feeling ...
perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness, its
changeability, and its terminability, and when he sees as it really is
with correct wisdom thus: ‘In the past and also now all form ...
feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness is
impermanent, subject to stress, and of the nature to change’, then he
abandons sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair. With their
abandonment, he does not become alarmed or frightened. Unafraid, he
dwells happily. A bhikkhu who dwells happily is said to be quenched in
that respect.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup> {634}</p>
<p><em>S. III. 42-3.</em></p>

</div>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflection-in-line-with-the-four-noble-truths" id="reflection-in-line-with-the-four-noble-truths">Reflection in Line with the Four Noble Truths</a></h3>
<p>Reflection in line with the Noble Truths, or reflection used to solve
problems, is informally called the ‘method of ending suffering’. It is
classified as a key form of reflection because it is possible to expand
it so that it encompasses all other forms of wise reflection.</p>
<p>This short passage encapsulates this kind of reflection:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A monk attends wisely thus: ‘This is suffering’; he attends wisely;
‘This is the origin of suffering’; he attends wisely: ‘This is the
cessation of suffering’; he attends wisely: ‘This is the way leading
to the cessation of suffering.’ When he attends wisely in this way,
three fetters are abandoned in him: personality view, doubt, and
adherence to rules and practices.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This kind of reflection has two general attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is in line with cause and effect. The investigation begins with
results and traces back to causes, followed by a subsequent
attending to and solving things at their source. It is divided into
two pairs:</p>
<p><strong>Pair #1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Suffering (<em>dukkha</em>) is the result: it is the problem; it is an
unsatisfactory situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The origin of suffering (<em>samudaya</em>) is the cause: it is the
source of the problem; it is the agent which must be eliminated
or attended to in order to be released from the problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pair #2</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cessation (<em>nirodha</em>) is the result: it is the end of the
problem; it is the goal to be reached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Path (<em>magga</em>) is the cause: it is the method; it is the way
of practice for dealing with the cause of problems and for
reaching the goal – the end of suffering.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is relevant, to the point, straightforward and direct; it focuses
on those things that one must practise and engage with in order to
solves life’s predicaments; it does not digress to matters of
indulgence and excess, i.e. to thoughts seeking to gratify craving,
conceit, and fixed opinions, which are irrelevant – which cannot be
used to solve problems.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this fourth kind of reflection corresponds with or
is connected to the third kind – the reflection in accord with
universal characteristics. To begin with, when one encounters a problem
and experiences suffering, one is able to come to an acceptance of the
situation (in accord with stage #1 of the third kind of reflection,
above). Then, when one is prepared to apply wisdom in order to solve the
problem (in accord with stage #2 of the third kind of reflection,
above), one gradually reflects on the details and particulars described
in this fourth kind of reflection.</p>
<p>The principle or essence of reflection in line with the Noble Truths is
to begin with an acknowledgement and clear understanding of a problem or
of suffering. From here, one searches for the source of this problem in
order to attend to it. At the same time, one clearly establishes one’s
goal – one knows the goal, one knows whether it is accessible or not,
and one knows how to reach it. Finally, one thinks of ways to eliminate
the source of the problem, leading to the realization of one’s
determined goal.</p>
<p>In the context of this kind of reflection it is necessary to be aware of
the responsibilities or duties vis-à-vis each of the Four Noble Truths.
To understand the gist of this matter, a summary of the Four Noble
Truths along with the corresponding stages of practice is presented
below: {635}</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong></p>
<p>Suffering (<em>dukkha</em>): problems, affliction, frustration, stress,
oppression, and deficiencies encountered by people in their lives. In
the most comprehensive sense this refers to the state in which
conditioned phenomena, the mind and body, the five aggregates, or the
entire world is subject to the laws of nature: they are impermanent and
inconstant; they are under pressure by and dependent upon conditioning
factors; they do not possess a ‘self’ which can be controlled and
dominated by anyone – consequently they conflict with desire and
attachment, leading to misery and dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Our sole responsibility in the face of suffering is to recognize and
understand it: to clearly understand its nature and the extent of the
problems. This is similar to a doctor who examines and diagnoses an
illness. This responsibility is referred to as ‘thorough knowledge’
(<em>pariññā</em>).</p>
<p>Our responsibility is not to brood over or worry about these problems,
or to resent the suffering and try and get rid of it, for thinking in
this way only increases it. It is fine to desire the end of suffering,
but suffering cannot be dispelled by desire. It can only be dispelled by
understanding it and by eliminating its causes. Hankering to end
suffering only causes further harm.</p>
<p>Besides acknowledging suffering, one also accepts the natural course of
things, as described in stage #1 of the third kind of reflection,
above. When one has gained a thorough understanding of suffering, or of
problems, then one’s duties in the context of this stage are complete.
One is prepared to move on to the second stage.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong></p>
<p>The cause of suffering (<em>samudaya</em>): the origin of problems; the various
conditioning factors that come together and conflict with one another,
leading to diverse forms of stress, pressure, affliction, discomfort,
and deficiency. One needs to discover these causes and then perform the
responsibility of <em>pahāna</em>: elimination or abandonment.</p>
<p>The Buddha described the principal agents that go hand-in-hand with
human suffering, both the actor standing at the front of the stage –
craving (<em>taṇhā</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup> – and the entire cast, or the complete process,
that is, the chain of conditioning factors beginning with ignorance
(<em>avijjā</em>), outlined in the teaching of Dependent Origination.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>When one experiences suffering or encounters a specific problem one
needs to look for the related causes and conditions in accord with the
first kind of reflection, above (the investigation of causes and
conditions). If the problem stems from conditioning factors within
oneself, one reflects on the principal agents (craving, or all factors
of Dependent Origination) along with accompanying conditions specific to
that situation. When one has investigated, analyzed, and discovered the
root of the problem which must be eliminated or abandoned, one’s
reflections in the context of this second stage are complete.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong></p>
<p>Cessation (<em>nirodha</em>): the cessation of suffering; the release from
suffering; the end of all problems. This is the goal, in respect to
which our responsibility is <em>sacchikiriyā</em>: to realize, actualize,
accomplish or reach it.</p>
<p>This stage requires the following reflections: What is the desired goal?
What is the purpose of spiritual practice? Where am I going in this
practice? Is this goal realistic? How can it be achieved? What are the
principles having to do with reaching this goal? What are the subsidiary
goals or the gradual sequence of lesser goals along the path to reaching
the main goal?</p>
<p><strong>Stage 4:</strong></p>
<p>Path (<em>magga</em>): the way leading to the cessation of suffering; the ways
of practice for bringing suffering to an end; the methods for solving
problems. This refers to those methods and details of practice required
for eliminating the cause of problems and for reaching the desired goal.
Our responsibility in this stage is <em>bhāvanā</em>: cultivation, practice,
application.</p>
<p>In regard to contemplation, the necessary task is to determine those
measures, procedures, and tactics required for successfully dealing with
the source of problems, and which are in harmony with the desired goal.
{636}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflection-on-goals-and-principles" id="reflection-on-goals-and-principles">Reflection on Goals and Principles</a></h3>
<p>This method refers to reflecting on and understanding the relationship
between goals (<em>attha</em>) and principles (<em>dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup> This is a very
important reflection when one undertakes spiritual practice or follows a
specific teaching, preventing one’s actions from being erratic, aimless,
or gullible.</p>
<p>The term <em>dhamma</em> here means ‘principle’ or ‘basis’. It refers to
principles of truth, of virtue, and of practice, and it includes
teachings which should be applied and followed correctly.</p>
<p><em>Attha</em> is defined as ‘meaning’, ‘objective’, ‘goal’, ‘desired benefit’,
or ‘desired essence’.</p>
<p>In Dhamma practice, or when following any sort of principle, it is
necessary to understand the meaning or purpose of that activity. One
should ask the questions: ‘Why was this principle (<em>dhamma</em>)
established?’ ‘Where does it lead to, both in terms of the final goal,
and in terms of intermediate targets which are connected to other
principles?’</p>
<p>A correct understanding of principles and objectives leads to the right
practice referred to as <em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>, which is
traditionally translated as ‘to practise the Dhamma in a way appropriate
to the Dhamma’. It can also be translated as ‘practising minor
principles of Dhamma consistent with major principles of Dhamma’. Very
simply, this means practising the Dhamma correctly: acting in such a way
that subsidiary factors of practice are in harmony with and nourish key
principles of practice, leading to the desired goal.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Practising the Dhamma correctly (<em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>) as
described above is vital. One can say that it is the criterion
determining whether Dhamma practice or a specific activity will succeed
and reach its goal or not. {637}</p>
<p>If one practises the Dhamma incorrectly one’s practice will be
defective, fruitless, and naive; it may even have the opposite desired
effect and cause harm.</p>
<p>Every principle (<em>dhamma</em>) has an objective and goal (<em>attha</em>); whatever
one engages in, one must be able to answer the question: ‘What am I
doing this for?’</p>
<p>There is a great emphasis on this form of reflection in Dhamma practice,
both as an attribute of individuals, for example in the seven qualities
of a virtuous person (<em>sappurisa-dhamma</em>) and the four kinds of analytic
insight (<em>paṭisambhidā</em>), and as part of a gradual sequence of practice,
for example in the four virtues conducive to growth in wisdom
(<em>paññāvuḍḍhi-dhamma</em>) and in the ways of practice described below.</p>
<p>Following are some passages from the Pali Canon on this subject:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, how is a monk a Dhamma-knower (<em>dhammaññū</em>)? Here, a monk in
this Dhamma and Vinaya knows the Dhamma, that is, the discourses,
stanzas, expositions, verses, exclamations, sayings, birth stories,
marvels, and answers to questions.</p>
<p>How is a monk a meaning-knower (<em>atthaññū</em>)? Here, a monk knows the
meaning of various teachings thus: ‘This is the meaning of this
teaching; this is the meaning of that teaching.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. IV. 113-14.</em></p>
<p>Monks, how is a person one of great knowledge (<em>bahussuta</em>) and one
who understands by way of learning (<em>suta</em>)? Some people have learned
much in respect to the discourses, stanzas, expositions, verses,
exclamations, sayings, birth stories, marvels, and answers to
questions. They thoroughly understand the essence and principles of
that large body of learning; they are ones who practise the Dhamma
correctly (<em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>). In this way a person is called
one of great knowledge and one who understands by learning.</p>
<p><em>A. II. 7-8.</em></p>
<p>Monks, the Dhamma that I have taught is extensive, that is, the
discourses, stanzas, expositions, verses, exclamations, sayings, birth
stories, marvels, and answers to questions. If a monk thoroughly
understands the meaning and principle of even one verse consisting of
four lines, and is one who practises the Dhamma correctly
(<em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>), he is worthy to be called one of great
knowledge, a champion of the Dhamma.</p>
<p><em>A. II. 178-9.</em></p>
<p>Monks, these five things make for the dissolution, for the
disappearance of the true Dhamma: the monks do not listen to the
Dhamma respectfully; they do not study the Dhamma respectfully; they
do not recollect the Dhamma respectfully; they do not reflect
respectfully on the meaning (<em>atthupaparikkhā</em>) of that Dhamma they
have memorized; when they understand the meaning and principle, they
do not practise the Dhamma in a way appropriate to the Dhamma
(<em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>).</p>
<p>Monks, these five things make for the stability, for the
non-dissolution, for the non-disappearance of the true Dhamma: the
monks listen to the Dhamma respectfully; they study the Dhamma
respectfully; they recollect the Dhamma respectfully; they reflect
respectfully on the meaning of that Dhamma they have memorized; when
they understand the meaning and principle, they practise the Dhamma in
a way appropriate to the Dhamma.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn34">34</a></sup> {638}</p>
<p><em>A. III. 176-7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The sequence of the principles described in the previous quotation can
be outlined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To listen to and study the Dhamma →<br />
to memorize the Dhamma →<br />
to reflect on its meaning →<br />
to practise the Dhamma in a way appropriate to the Dhamma.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This same sequence is found in many other suttas, and can thus be
considered an important principle of Buddhist training and
practice.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>Let us compare this teaching with the principle of wisdom development,
or the four factors making for stream-entry:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, these four things are conducive to the growth of wisdom, that
is: association with superior persons, hearing the true Dhamma, wise
reflection, and practice in accordance with the Dhamma.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn36">36</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. II. 246.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These two teachings are essentially the same. Note, however, that in the
former teaching the factor of wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) is
replaced by the term ‘reflection on the meaning’ (<em>atthupaparikkhā</em>).</p>
<p>The use of the term <em>atthupaparikkhā</em> here seems to be narrowing the
definition of <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em> in this circumstance, by focusing
primarily on this fifth kind of reflection being discussed in this
section. That is, when one understands the relationship between
principles (<em>dhamma</em>) and objectives (<em>attha</em>), one reaches the next
step of proper application of the teachings
(<em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>).</p>
<p>Many sutta passages clarify the relationship between <em>dhamma</em>
(principle) and <em>attha</em> (objective; essence; benefit; purpose) for
example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, Dhamma and not Dhamma (<em>adhamma</em>) are to be understood,

</div>
<p>This reflection and understanding of goals and principles is worthy of
constant attention. Indeed, the ‘middleness’ (<em>majjhimā</em>) of the Middle
Way is determined by an understanding and awareness of the true goal of
practice. Moreover, each subdivision or factor of the Middle Way has
specific objectives, as well as a common goal, which need to be borne in
mind and understood in order to practise them correctly: for these
factors to be well-integrated with one another and for them to lead
gradually to the intended goal. In other words, a knowledge and
understanding of the objectives, benefits, and limitations of specific
spiritual factors determines the correctness and evenness of one’s
practice, resulting in <em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>: to practise the
Dhamma in a way appropriate to the Dhamma.</p>
<p>From a perspective of the ultimate good (<em>paramattha</em>) – not from the
perspective of mundane welfare (<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>), heavenly welfare
(<em>samparāyikattha</em>), others’ welfare (<em>parattha</em>), or social welfare –
virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>), concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and wisdom
(<em>paññā</em>) share the same final goal of Nibbāna. But from a more limited
perspective, each of these three factors has its own perimeter and
sphere of activity which must be linked with the function of the others,
enabling the attainment of the final goal. By themselves these factors
cannot lead to ultimate success; at the same time each one of these
factors is essential and indispensable. Thus the maxim: virtuous conduct
leads to concentration; concentration leads to wisdom; and wisdom leads
to liberation.</p>
<p>If one practises moral conduct without a clear direction it may become
an adherence to rules and religious practices (<em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>),
feeding into the extreme of self-mortification (<em>attakilamathānuyoga</em>).
If one develops concentration without reflecting on its true purpose,
one may get caught up in psychic powers, strengthening wrong view or
various forms of base arts (<em>tiracchāna-vijjā</em>). If one develops wisdom
that is not conducive to liberation, one deviates from the Middle Way
and does not reach the goal of Buddhism; one may get lost along the path
or become stuck in some form of wrong view. {641}</p>
<p>For this reason, it is possible for a Dhamma practitioner to practise
incorrectly and go astray at every stage of practice. For example, in
relation to the beginning stage of practice, of virtuous conduct, there
exists the general tenet that a strict and pure observance of moral
precepts and rules is an essential quality of a Dhamma practitioner; he
or she must constantly give great import to moral conduct. Nevertheless,
despite a strict observance to morality, if one lacks an awareness of
the relationship between principles (<em>dhamma</em>) and goals (<em>attha</em>) – if
one forgets the true purpose and objective of moral conduct, as well as
its parameters, benefits, and place in relation to other factors – one
may be remiss in one’s practice at any time.</p>
<p>A person may mistakenly consider morality as inherently complete, as
something existing in isolation, not as part of a larger spiritual
process. Alternatively, a lack of awareness about the true purpose and
objective of moral conduct may lead people to attach to various
conventions, to simply follow traditional ways of behaving without
understanding the reasons for such behaviour; they do not see that
<em>sīla</em> is a tool for training oneself.</p>
<p>Some people unconsciously entertain the belief that moral strictness or
puritanism is good and complete in itself; goodness and spiritual
accomplishment is achieved simply by adhering to a code of ethics.
Morality thus becomes an end in itself rather than a stage of practice
leading to a higher goal.</p>
<p>Other people indulge in the belief that the stricter or more austere one
practises, the better. For such people an awareness of the true purpose
of moral conduct is completely absent. They create increasingly severe
and austere forms of practice. Those who witness such practices in
others and who lack wise reflection will equally be led astray: their
faith will increase in proportion to the extreme austerities they see in
others.</p>
<p>This kind of belief is one cause for peculiar forms of ascetic
practices, which the Buddha referred to as ‘severe (or brutish)
practices of naked ascetics’. Such practices are examples of an
adherence to rules and practices (<em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>) and fall under
the extreme of self-mortification (<em>attakilamathānuyoga</em>). Examples of
such practices include: eating only fermented vegetables; eating grass;
eating only fallen fruit; wearing discarded cloth; wearing grass
garments; pulling out the head hair and beard; and lying on a bed of
thorns. Indeed, there exist many more extreme forms of practice as those
just mentioned. (See
Note <a href="#note-ascetic-practices">Ascetic Practices</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Ascetic Practices</span><a id="note-ascetic-practices"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>See the ascetic practices (<em>nijjhāma-paṭipadā</em>) listed at: A. I. 295.</p>
<p>The Buddha included some of these practices in Buddhism, permitting
the monks to observe them, for example to wear only rag-robes (robes
made from discarded cloth). But the reason for including them is that
they are consistent with a simple life and do not cause harm (A. II.
26-7).</p>
<p>In the case of discarded cloth, a monk must first wash, sew and dye it
according to prescribed standards. These ascetic practices are
considered special; they are observed voluntarily and are not
compulsory.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>People who understand the true objective of moral conduct will also give
precedence to moral strictness and ethical codes, but they will reflect
on the relationship of morality to other aspects of spiritual practice.
They are able to discriminate, by reflecting in the following ways:
‘These are universal principles of morality, while these are
supplementary observances and practices’; ‘This person should strictly
observe this precept for this reason’; ‘This precept should be
compulsory for everyone equally, for this reason or for this desired
result’; ‘This practice should be voluntary, because of these
differences between individual people’; ‘This person practises strictly
and has attained success, while this other person practises strictly and
has not succeeded – why is this so?’; ‘This person does not practise
very strictly but has made more progress than another person who
practises strictly – what are the reasons for this?’</p>
<p>This kind of reflection, on principles and goals, may be less important
when one has a virtuous friend and teacher nearby. In such a
circumstance, one relies in large part on faith in the teacher’s wisdom
and a trust that one’s practice will gradually progress. If the teacher
is truly wise and skilled, he or she will be able to explain the
principles and objectives at each stage of practice. {642}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflection-on-advantages-disadvantages-and-the-escape" id="reflection-on-advantages-disadvantages-and-the-escape">Reflection on Advantages, Disadvantages, and the Escape</a></h3>
<p>The reflection on advantages (<em>assāda</em>), disadvantages (<em>ādīnava</em>), and
the escape (<em>nissaraṇa</em>) is another method of discerning things as they
really are, by emphasizing the acknowledgement of every aspect of a
particular object, including its good and bad features. This reflection
is directly linked to the practical application of Dhamma teachings, and
includes a recognition of how important it is to clearly understand a
problem and to know one’s intended destination before making the effort
to solve the problem. Similarly, before abandoning one thing in order to
take up another, one must know both things well, leading to the insight
that such action is suitable, correct, and done with circumspection.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Assāda</em>: advantage; merit; good quality; sweetness; gratifying
aspect; delicious aspect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ādīnava</em>: disadvantage; fault; defect; drawback; shortcoming;
danger; harmful aspect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nissaraṇa</em>: escape; way out; state of deliverance; relinquishment;
freedom from problems; inherent completeness; a state of true
goodness, independent of merits and defects, free from problems and
those things that one has abandoned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two important attributes of this form of reflection:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To see things according to the truth means that one sees both the
good and bad sides, both the merits and harmful aspects, of an
object. One does not simply see only the good aspects or only the
negative aspects. For example, to truly see into the nature of sense
desire (<em>kāma</em>), one knows both its merits and its harmful
aspects.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one wishes to solve a problem or to escape from an undesirable
situation, it is not enough to simply know the merits and harm –
the advantages and disadvantages – of that problematic item or that
unsatisfactory situation. One must also see the way out and to see
the goal – to see the nature of the goal and how to get there. How
is the goal better than those defects, weaknesses, and harmful
aspects that one is currently facing? Is it true that by reaching
this goal one is no longer dependent on these former advantages and
disadvantages? Does this goal – this freedom from problems – truly
exist?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One should not hastily try and get rid of problems or be too rash in
one’s practice. For example, although the Buddha clearly understood the
many harmful effects and faults of sensuality, until he had seen the way
out of sensuality, he did not assert that he would not return to indulge
in it:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn42">42</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before my awakening, O monks, when I was still a bodhisatta and not
yet enlightened, this thought occurred to me: ‘What is the positive
aspect (<em>assāda</em>) in the world, what is the deficiency (<em>ādīnava</em>) in
the world, and what is the escape (<em>nissaraṇa</em>) from the world?’ Then
I thought: ‘Whatever delight and happiness there is dependent on
worldly things, that is the positive aspect in the world; that the
world is impermanent, pervaded by suffering, and subject to change,
that is the deficiency in the world; the removal and abandoning of
desire and lust for the world [i.e. Nibbāna], that is the escape

monks. Whatever gratification there is in the world, that I have
found; and in how far there is gratification in the world that I have
clearly seen by wisdom. I went in search of the danger (<em>ādīnava</em>) in
the world. Whatever danger there is in the world, that I have found;
and in how far there is danger in the world, that I have clearly seen

there is danger in the world, beings become disenchanted with it. If
there were no escape from the world, beings could not escape from the

boundless mind.</p>

understand as they really are the world’s gratification as
gratification, its danger as danger, and the escape from the world as
escape, for so long they cannot confess to being ascetics among

pleasures.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 91-92.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These passages from the Pali Canon describe this kind of reflection,
which can be applied in a general context, even to individual spiritual
factors. For example, the Paṭisambhidāmagga describes the advantages and
disadvantages of the five spiritual faculties (<em>indriya</em>). In regard to
concentration, the absence of restlessness (<em>uddhacca</em>), the absence of
agitation due to restlessness, the strength resulting from having a
steadfast mind, and the refined states of happiness
(<em>sukhavihāra-dhamma</em>) comprise the advantages (<em>assāda</em>) of
concentration. The fact that restlessness and the agitation due to
restlessness can return, and that concentration is impermanent, subject
to stress, and not-self, comprise its disadvantages (<em>ādīnava</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>Generally speaking, in everyday life and practice, people are faced with
choices, between those things that are harmful and other things that are
meritorious and free from danger. Even in the case of an escape
(<em>nissaraṇa</em>), the possible ways out are relative, that is, one chooses
the optimum way out in a specific circumstance.</p>
<p>In these situations one should not neglect to use this form of
reflection on the advantages, disadvantages, and escape. One should
acknowledge the positive aspects of those things or those practices that
one is abandoning. And very importantly, one should not overlook the
dangers, faults, shortcomings, and opportunities for loss of those
things that one chooses to undertake.</p>
<p>Reflecting on things in this manner enables one to practise in an
optimal and vigilant way. One may be able to retain the positive aspects
of those things one has abandoned, and one may be able to avoid or to
redeem the negative or faulty aspects of those things one has
undertaken.</p>
<p>An example of this form of reflection in the context of formal Dhamma
teachings is the Buddha’s key teaching referred to as the ‘graduated
sermon’ (<em>anupubbikathā</em>). The Buddha gave this teaching regularly and
to a general audience, especially before describing the Four Noble
Truths.</p>
<p>The graduated sermon outlines a virtuous, charitable, and upright life,
based on the principles of generosity (<em>dāna</em>) and moral conduct
(<em>sīla</em>). It then describes the abundant happiness and contentment –
referred to as a happy or heavenly abiding (<em>sagga</em>) – that results
from living such a virtuous life. From here it describes the drawbacks,
deficiencies, dangers and imperfection of that form of happiness and
abundance, referred to here as the ‘disadvantages of sensual pleasure’
(<em>kāmādīnava</em>). Finally, it describes the escape along with the benefits
of escape, referred to as the ‘benefits of renouncing sensual pleasure’
(<em>nekkhammānisaṁsa</em>). When the listener saw these benefits, the Buddha
concluded by teaching the Four Noble Truths. {646}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflection-on-the-true-and-counterfeit-value-of-things" id="reflection-on-the-true-and-counterfeit-value-of-things">Reflection on the True and Counterfeit Value of Things</a></h3>
<p>The reflection on the true and counterfeit value of things, or the
reflection on using and consuming (<em>paṭisevanā</em>), acts to prevent or
dispel craving (<em>taṇhā</em>). It is applied to subdue defilements or to
prevent defilements from overwhelming the mind, and it then influences
people’s subsequent behaviour.</p>
<p>This form of reflection may be applied often in everyday life because it
is connected to the use of the four requisites and to the consumption of
material objects. It follows the basic maxim that human beings relate to
things because they have needs and believe that these things will
satisfy their needs. Whichever things satisfy our needs are considered
valuable or useful. The value of things can be classified into two
kinds, according to the nature of a person’s needs and requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>True value: this refers to the direct value, benefit, or meaning of
an object in meeting the requirements for human life. Alternatively,
it refers to the way in which people use things in order to address
personal issues, aiming for personal wellbeing or the welfare of
others.</p>
<p>This true value relies on wisdom for assessment and evaluation; it
can even be called the value conforming to wisdom. For example, the
true value of food is that it nourishes the body, sustains life,
facilitates good health and physical comfort, and provides one with
strength to perform one’s activities. The true value of a car is
that it enables one to travel quickly, and supports one’s work,
overall way of life, and meritorious actions; in choosing a car one
should focus on convenience, safety, stability, endurance, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supplementary or counterfeit value: this refers to the value,
benefit, or meaning of an object that people add to it in order to
experience sense pleasure or to boost and reinforce a cherished
sense of self. This counterfeit value relies on craving for
assessment and evaluation; it can be called the value gratifying
craving. For example, a person gives value to food because it is
delicious, it adds to a sense of fun, it is a mark of luxury, or it
helps one to look smart and stylish. Similarly, a person chooses a
car because it is a sign of wealth and status; here, one focuses on
the car’s beauty and brand name distinction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This form of reflection is applied when relating to things in general:
when acquiring, consuming, using, and owning things. Here, one gives
emphasis to understanding the true value of things, recognizing what is
of genuine benefit to oneself and others.</p>
<p>Besides truly benefitting people’s lives, a recognition of the true
value of things supports the development of wholesome qualities like
mindfulness, and through the application of wisdom it frees people from
the enslavement by material things. Moreover, it is accompanied by a
sense of appropriateness and moderation. This is in contrast to
attaching a counterfeit value on things through craving, which provides
little benefit and can even endanger people’s lives. It increases such
unwholesome qualities as greed, infatuation, jealousy, arrogance,
conceit, and false views, and leads to conflict and oppression. For
example, a meal costing three dollars eaten with discernment may be of
more benefit to one’s body than a meal costing fifty dollars eaten in
order to boost one’s self-image or simply for sensual gratification.</p>

from cold, for protection from heat, for protection from contact with

<h3><a class="header" href="#reflection-rousing-wholesome-qualities" id="reflection-rousing-wholesome-qualities">Reflection Rousing Wholesome Qualities</a></h3>
<p>Wise reflection rousing wholesome qualities can also be referred to as
reflection mobilizing virtue, reflection on cultivating virtue, or
contemplation conducive to a wholesome and beneficial course of
thinking. It is used to prevent, reduce, or dispel craving, and is thus
classified as part of preliminary spiritual practice. It promotes the
growth of wholesome qualities and generates mundane right view.</p>
<p>The general premise behind this form of reflection is that different
people may experience or cognize the same phenomenon in different ways.
They may see and think in a different manner, according to the structure
of their minds, their accumulated habits and proclivities (i.e. their
<em>saṅkhārā</em> – the ‘fashioners’ or ‘determinants’ of the mind), or their
considerations in that moment.</p>
<p>In regard to a single object, one person may look at it and think in
wholesome, beneficial and virtuous ways, while another person may look
at it and think in negative, harmful or unwholesome ways. Similarly, and
for the same reasons mentioned above, a single person may experience the
same object at different points in time, and create different ideas and
opinions about it. At one moment he likes it, in the next he does not.

</div>
<p>This form of reflection plays an important role in generating wholesome
thoughts and actions during the time of reflection, and in helping to
rectify longstanding negative habits and inclinations, while at the same
time creating new, alternative wholesome habits.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if one lacks this skilful means of reflection, one’s
thoughts and actions will be influenced by the power of accumulated
habits alone, which will in turn be continually reinforced by these
thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>One simple example of this which is found in the scriptures is the
reflection on death. If one applies unwise or unskilful attention
(<em>ayoniso-manasikāra</em>), unwholesome states will arise. For example, when
one thinks of death one feels depressed, sad, discouraged, or
frightened, or when one thinks of the death of an enemy one feels
delight.</p>
<p>If one applies wise reflection, on the other hand, wholesome states will
arise. One will feel vigilant and inspired; one will strive to perform
one’s duties, act in beneficial ways, and practise the Dhamma, and one
will gain insight into the true nature of conditioned phenomena.</p>
<p>As outlined in the scriptures, a skilful reflection on death includes
the factors of mindfulness (<em>sati</em>; to be circumspect; to bear in mind
those things that need to be engaged with), a sense of urgency
(<em>saṁvega</em>; motivation), and knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>; knowledge in line with
the truth). Many skilful methods are recommended in regard to reflection
on death.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn48">48</a></sup></p>
<p>There are many passages in the Tipiṭaka in which the Buddha describes
how in the same incident or situation one way of thinking will lead to
laziness while another way will lead to effort. Here is one example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are eight occasions of indolence (kusīta-vatthu). What
eight?</p>
<p>Here, a monk has a job to do. He thinks: ‘I’ve got this job to do, but
it will make me tired. First, I’ll have a rest.’ So he lies down and
does not marshal energy to complete the uncompleted, to accomplish the
unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized.</p>
<p>Or he has done some work, and thinks: ‘I’ve done this work, now I’m
tired. I’ll have a rest.’ So he lies down....</p>
<p>Or he has to go on a journey, and thinks: ‘I have to go on this
journey. It will make me tired. First, I’ll have a rest.’ So he lies
down....</p>
<p>Or he has been on a journey, and thinks: ‘I’ve finished the journey,
now I’m tired. I’ll have a rest.’ So he lies down.... {649}</p>
<p>Or he goes on almsround in a village or town and does not get his fill
of food, whether coarse or fine, and he thinks: ‘I’ve gone for alms in
a village or town and have not got my fill of food, whether coarse or
fine. My body is tired and not fit for work. I’ll have a rest.’ So he
lies down....</p>
<p>Or he goes on almsround in a village or town and gets his fill of
food, either coarse or fine, and he thinks: ‘I’ve gone for alms in a
village or town and have got my fill of food, either coarse or fine.
My body is heavy like a load of soaked beans and not fit for work.
I’ll have a rest.’ So he lies down....</p>
<p>Or he has developed some slight sickness, and he thinks: ‘I’ve
developed some slight sickness. There is a good reason to lie down.
I’d better have a rest.’ So he lies down....</p>
<p>Or he is recuperating, having not long recovered from an illness, and
he thinks: ‘I am recuperating, having not long recovered from an
illness. My body is weak and not fit for work. I’ll have a rest.’ So
he lies down....</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>By reflecting in another manner, however, each of these identical
situations can lead to the application of effort. The eight occasions
for commencing the making of effort (<em>ārabbha-vatthu</em>) are as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are eight occasions for rousing effort. What eight?</p>
<p>Here, a monk has a job to do. He thinks: ‘I’ve got this job to do, but

the Buddhas. So I will stir up sufficient energy to complete the
uncompleted, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realize the
unrealized.’</p>
<p>Or he has finished some work, and thinks: ‘Well, I did the job, but
while doing it I wasn’t able to pay ample attention to the teaching of
the Buddhas. So I will stir up sufficient energy....’</p>
<p>Or he has to go on a journey, and thinks: ‘I have to go on this
journey, but in doing so I won’t find it easy to pay attention to the

</div>
<p>In the case that negative thoughts arise, the scriptures suggest methods
for addressing them, and most of these methods entail the use of
reflection rousing wholesome qualities. For example, in the
Vitakkasaṇṭhāna Sutta the Buddha describes five general principles or
stages for dealing with unwholesome thoughts.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn50">50</a></sup> In sum, if evil,
unwholesome thoughts accompanied by greed,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn51">51</a></sup> hatred, or delusion
arise, one can rectify them in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To think about or pay attention to (<em>manasikāra</em>) something else –
something wholesome and virtuous. For instance one thinks about
something generating a feeling of lovingkindness, instead of
something that rouses anger. If by doing this, the negative thoughts
still prevail:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To consider the harm of such negative thoughts – on how they are
unskilful and destructive, and lead to suffering. If they continue:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To conduct one’s life by not paying attention to such negative
thoughts, similar to how a person who does not want to see something
closes his eyes or looks at something else. If they still do not
cease:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reflect on the conditioned nature (<em>saṅkhāra-saṇṭhāna</em>) of such
thoughts: to hold these thoughts in awareness as objects of study
for increasing knowledge, rather than considering them as personal
problems. One investigates the nature of these thoughts and searches
for their root causes. If they still do not disappear:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To clamp down on one’s teeth and press one’s tongue to the roof of
one’s mouth, making a firm determination to restrain and eliminate
these negative thoughts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In some passages, methods are described for addressing specific kinds of
unwholesome thoughts. For example, the Buddha suggested the following
methods for eliminating malice and resentment: one should develop
lovingkindness, compassion, and equanimity in regard to that person who
is the object of one’s resentment; one should simply disregard that
person; or one should consider that person in light of the principles of
kamma, that that person is the owner of his kamma, the heir to his
kamma, born of his kamma, related to his kamma, abides supported by his
kamma, whatever kamma he should do, for good or for ill, of that he will
be the heir.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, Ven. Sāriputta suggested five methods for eliminating malice
and aversion, which are based on an understanding of the differences
between people:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some people, although their physical actions are not impeccable,
their speech is well-mannered and disciplined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people, although their speech is bad mannered, their physical
actions are impeccable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people, although neither their speech nor their physical
actions are well-mannered, their mind is still occasionally
wholesome and pure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people have bad-mannered speech and physical actions, and their
minds have no opportunity to be virtuous and pure, even temporarily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people have impeccable speech and physical actions, and their
minds are constantly virtuous and pure. {651}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In regard to those people whose physical actions are faulty but whose
speech is well-mannered, one should dispel one’s aversion by focusing on
their wholesome speech and disregarding their unwholesome physical
deeds. This is similar to a monk who keeps the <em>dhutaṅga</em> rule of
wearing only rag robes. When he finds a discarded rag on the road, he
steps on it with his left foot, spreads it out with his right foot, and
tears off only those parts which are good and usable.</p>
<p>In regard to those people whose speech is faulty but whose physical
actions are well-mannered, one should focus on their wholesome deeds and
disregard their unskilful speech. This is similar to a lotus pond
completely covered by algae. When a traveller arrives, hot, tired, and
thirsty, he goes down into the pond, sweeps the algae away with his
hands, cups his hands together to scoop up the water, drinks, and goes
on his way.</p>
<p>In regard to those people whose verbal and physical actions are faulty,
but who know occasional moments of goodness and purity, one should
disregard their tainted verbal and physical actions. Instead, one should
focus on the fact that their minds are occasionally open to goodness.
This is similar to a small amount of water contained in a cow’s hoof
print. A traveller, hot, tired, and thirsty, sees this water and thinks:
‘There is only a little water in this hoof print. If I scoop it up with
my hands or with a bowl, the water will become so cloudy that it may
become unpotable. Why don’t I kneel down, support myself with my arms,
and drink like a cow?’ In this way he drinks the water and goes on his
way.</p>
<p>In regard to those people whose verbal and physical actions are faulty,
and furthermore whose minds are not virtuous and pure even temporarily,
one should establish oneself in kindness and compassion, thinking of
ways to assist them, by considering: ‘Indeed, let this person abandon
such unwholesome actions by body, speech, and mind, and cultivate
wholesome actions. May this person not die and be reborn in a state of
perdition, misery, ruin, in hell.’ This is like a sick person, afflicted
and gravely ill, who is on a long journey. Both the next village ahead
and the preceding village behind are far away. He is unable to obtain
suitable food, medicine, and nursing care, or to find someone to lead
him to a village. Another traveller sees him and responds with kindness
and eagerness to help, thinking: ‘May this person obtain suitable food,
medicine, and care, or find someone to lead him to a village. May this
person not end in ruin and destruction here.’</p>
<p>In regard to those people whose speech and physical actions are
impeccable, and whose minds are continually virtuous and pure, one
should focus on their constant verbal, physical and mental purity. Such
people are considered worthy of respect in all facets of their lives.
Moreover, they engender a joyous and pure mind in those who think of
them. This is similar to a beautiful lotus pond with clear and cool
water and with tranquil borders covered with various plants. When a
traveller arrives, parched, tired, and thirsty, he goes down into the
pond and drinks the water, and then either sits or lies down in the
shade of the bordering trees.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn53">53</a></sup> {652}</p>
<p>The Visuddhimagga describes many methods of contemplation for dispelling
angry, resentful thoughts. These can be summarized as a series of stages
and should be applied as is suitable to a person’s individual
disposition:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn54">54</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To recollect the Buddha’s teachings on overcoming anger and on
practising lovingkindness; to remind oneself that getting caught up
in anger is to fail to follow the teachings of one’s teacher – the
Buddha. There are numerous teachings by the Buddha on anger. For
example, he told the monks that even if one were to be captured by
bandits and cut in half with a saw, if one were to harbour malice
and hatred towards them, one could not be said to be following the
Buddha’s teachings. Moreover, an angry person creates self-inflicted
harm consistent with the wishes of his enemies, for example: his
appearance is wretched, his facial features are cheerless, he sleeps
miserably, etc. Furthermore, if someone else is angry and one
responds with anger, one is worse than that person. Someone who does
not respond to anger with anger is called one who has won an
extremely difficult battle, and helps both parties – both himself
and the other person involved. If by considering in this way one’s
anger is not dispelled:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To think about the other person’s good qualities; to reflect only on
the person’s good attributes. If one does not discern any good
qualities in that person, one should establish one’s mind in
compassion, by considering how he will invariably encounter harmful
effects from his evil actions. If by considering in this way, one’s
anger is not dispelled:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To inform oneself that getting caught up in anger only creates
trouble and misery for oneself. The person with whom one is angry is
unaware of one’s misery and remains unaffected. An angry person thus
ends up hurting himself, destroys the good qualities acting as a
basis for virtuous conduct, and performs the actions of an ‘ignoble
person’ (<em>anariya-puggala</em>). If an angry person thinks of harming
someone else, regardless of whether he accomplishes this deed or
not, he invariably hurts himself first and experiences suffering. If
by contemplating in this way, one’s anger is still not appeased:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reflect in line with the law of kamma that every person is the
owner of his or her actions; all people, including oneself, must
reap the fruit of their individual actions. If we are caught up in
anger, this itself is negative kamma and we will experience the
ill-effects of this unskilful action. Likewise, if others behave
badly, they will receive the effects of these actions. If by
thinking in this way one’s anger is still not dispelled:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To consider the Buddha’s goodness – his cultivation of the
perfections (<em>pāramī</em>); to recollect as an ideal the Buddha’s acts
of self-sacrifice, ever since he was a bodhisatta. There are many
Jātaka stories, for instance, describing how he sacrificed his life
for others, even the lives of his enemies; when they acted
spitefully towards him, he did not seek revenge but rather was able
to win them over through goodness. One can similarly reflect on
other examples of the cultivation by specific individuals of the
perfections of renunciation and patience, in order to strengthen
one’s resolve and establish oneself in virtuous conduct. If by
contemplating in this way, one’s anger is still not appeased:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To consider the enormous length of time of the round of rebirth, in
reference to which it is taught that it is difficult to find anyone
who has not previously been one’s mother, father, brother, sister,
son, daughter, relative, or companion – those who have offered
support and assistance in the past. One should reflect on how the
person with whom one is angry has most likely been one’s parent or
child in the past. This incident arousing anger is simply a minor
event – a single episode – in one’s long shared history. One
should refrain from fostering hatred and harbouring thoughts of
ill-will towards each other. If by contemplating in this way one’s
anger still remains: {653}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To reflect on the blessings of lovingkindness; to consider the
benefits of kindness, for example: one goes to sleep with joy; one
wakes with joy; one does not have nightmares; and one is cherished
by others. One should act kindly in order to reap these benefits. If
by considering in this way, one’s anger does not disappear:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To distinguish and analyze various elements (<em>dhātu</em>), in order to
discern that in the context of getting worked up and angry, one is
in fact dealing with conventional phenomena, that is, one simply
assumes that this or that person exists as a separate entity. In
truth, there is only the convergence of the thirty-two parts (e.g.
hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, and skin), of
various elements, of the five aggregates, and of the twelve sense
spheres. Wherever one’s anger is directed, it has no purchase, no
true foundation on which to rest. If by considering in this way, one
is still not free from anger:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To make a physical gesture of offering a gift; to find something to
give in order to show one’s goodwill and to exchange gifts with the
other person. Giving helps to soften people’s hearts; it brings
people together, enabling them to speak with one another with kindly
words. It is thus an extremely effective instrument for quelling
malice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are simple examples of methods of contemplation classified under
the heading of ‘reflection rousing wholesome qualities’. Some of these
methods can be used in everyday circumstances, while others are used in
relation to specific virtues. The important point here is that by
understanding the general principles and methods of this form of
reflection well, a person clever at skilful means will be able to devise
additional detailed and effective models of this kind of reflection,
which are suitable to cultivating specific virtues, consistent with and
relevant to the ways of thinking of people in their specific time
period. One can say that this rousing of wholesome qualities is the most
conducive kind of reflection for developing and discovering
supplementary methods of practice, as befitting different kinds of
personal dispositions, and corresponding to the changing external
conditions of time and place.</p>
<p>Here, it is important to reemphasize the role of mindfulness (<em>sati</em>),
which constantly keeps one’s thinking within the domain of wise
reflection. Mindfulness prevents one’s thinking from erring into unwise
reflection and helps pull attention back, re-establishing it in wise
reflection. A person who sustains wise reflection thus applies
mindfulness continually.</p>
<p>It is possible to divide all kinds of wise reflection into two
categories: wise reflection used for understanding the truth and wise
reflection for cultivating wholesome qualities. The point of divergence
between these two exists at the moment of establishing one’s thoughts,
and mindfulness can play an important role in deciding between these two
kinds of wise reflection, in a similar way that it chooses wise over
unwise reflection. For example, when one cognizes a sense object and
mindfulness focuses attention in order to understand its true nature,
this corresponds with wise reflection for understanding the truth. If
mindfulness focuses on a specific virtue, however, or recollects a
wholesome image in the mind, this corresponds with wise reflection for
cultivating wholesome qualities. Wise reflection for understanding the
truth depends on truth, which exists according to its own nature, and
thus this reflection is certain and unified. Wise reflection for
cultivating wholesome qualities, however, is a matter connected to
mental conceptions within the sphere of volitional formations
(<em>saṅkhāra</em>), and it is thus capable of being diversified and taking
many shapes. {654}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflection-by-abiding-in-the-present-moment" id="reflection-by-abiding-in-the-present-moment">Reflection by Abiding in the Present Moment</a></h3>
<p>This ninth kind of reflection, of dwelling in the moment – or
reflection with present phenomena as its focus of attention – is simply
another aspect of other forms of reflection. One can say that it is
combined with or encompasses the previous eight kinds of reflection. The
reason for distinguishing it, however, is that it has a unique
importance and has some attributes requiring special understanding.</p>
<p>The gist of this kind of reflection is contained and outlined in the
teaching on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, which will be discussed
in the section on the seventh factor of the Eightfold Path – right
mindfulness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn55">55</a></sup> The reason for including this kind of reflection here
is that there is a distinct focus in these two contexts. The description
within the Four Foundations of Mindfulness focuses on the establishment
of mindfulness, by bearing in mind and being fully awake to things as
they arise and exist, to the process of cognition, and to one’s present
activities in every moment. In this context of wise reflection, however,
the focus is on the application and content of thought, which is focused
on by mindfulness.</p>
<p>The point requiring special attention in relation to this kind of
reflection is the misunderstanding about the true meaning of abiding in
the present moment. That is, some people believe that Buddhism teaches
to only think about things existing in the immediate present; it
dissuades people from thinking about the past or the future, or from
planning for future events. Practitioners who have this misunderstanding
will stray from Buddhist principles, and non-Buddhists who have this
understanding will focus on the harmful consequences they believe
Buddhism causes for its followers.</p>
<p>The important points to understand concerning the past, the present, and
the future in relation to this ninth kind of wise reflection are as
follows:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>In short, thinking that is not grounded in the present moment –
thinking caught up in the past or drifting off into the future –
follows the direction of and is subject to craving; it follows one’s
feelings, or in modern parlance it falls under the sway of one’s
emotions.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn57">57</a></sup> In this case one hankers after and longs for those things
that have passed one by, because of an attachment to or a lingering over
a mental image or memory, or one drifts off into abstract thoughts and
fantasies of things that may or may not take place in the future,
because one feels stifled, frustrated, and discontent with the
conditions one faces and wants to escape from the present.</p>
<p>Thinking that remains in the present moment, on the other hand, follows
the direction of knowledge or is subject to the power of wisdom. If one
is able to think in this way, regardless of whether one’s thoughts are
of present, past, or future events, they are still classified as an
abiding in the present. It is clear that in Buddhism wise consideration
of the past, present, and future at every stage of practice is both
vital and correct. This is true for the stage of everyday practice, like
learning from lessons experienced in the past and being careful to
prevent danger in the future, up to the stage of realizing the truth;
and it is even an aspect of the Buddha’s activities, in which he applied
say the knowledge of the recollection of past lives
(<em>pubbenivāsānussati-ñāṇa</em>), knowledge of the past (<em>atītaṁsa-ñāṇa</em>),
and knowledge of the future (<em>anāgataṁsa-ñāṇa</em>). {655}</p>
<p>The true meanings of the terms ‘past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’ in the
Buddhist teachings, in the context of spiritual training, are not the
same as how people generally understand these terms. People’s general
concept of the term ‘present’ encompasses a rather broad and indistinct
period of time. In the context of Buddhist spiritual practice, however,
the ‘present’ refers to a single immediate moment of time. On a deeper
level, to dwell or to live in the present refers to being mindful, to
remain fully attentive to that which one is experiencing or doing in
each and every moment. If one cognizes something and either delight or
aversion arises, one then gets stuck at and revolves around the mental
image of that thing which one has created in one’s mind. One thus
‘falls’ into the past, does not keep abreast of things as they really
are, and slips away from the present moment. Alternatively, if one falls
away from the present and begins to fantasize about things that have not
yet come to pass, based on an attachment to specific mental images, then
one drifts off into the future. For this reason, the ‘past’ and the
‘future’ as defined in the Buddhist teachings may be a part of the
general worldly understanding of the term ‘present’.</p>
<p>Here we see one important aspect of the way in which the ‘present’ is
defined in the Buddhist teachings: the focus is not so much on events in
the world or on external phenomena, but rather on those things with
which one is immediately engaged. For this reason, those things that are
considered to be the past or the future according to people’s general
understanding may in the Buddhist context refer to the present, just as
people’s general concepts of the present may in the Buddhist context
refer to the past or future, as mentioned above. In Buddhism, the
present pertains to one’s involvement and association with things, which
requires an understanding and an engaged response, and which in a wider
sense extends to one’s daily-life practice. In relation to thinking, the
‘present’ encompasses all events that are linked to one’s immediate
experience and current considerations: to those things which one is
engaged with, which require some form of active response, or which are
connected to one’s spiritual practice. This is very different from
muddled, incoherent, aimless, or abstract thoughts connected to pleasing
or displeasing sense objects, or from getting caught up in delight and
aversion.</p>
<p>These descriptions of the past, present, and future are made clear in
the following teachings by the Buddha. The teachings by the Buddha about
neither dwelling in the past nor fantasizing about the future help to
sever such errant thoughts by encouraging people to stay attentive to
those things that truly exist while they are engaged in their
activities, as is evident from the following canonical passages:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Let one not hanker after the past, nor build one’s hopes on the
future; for the past has been left behind and the future has not been
reached. One who has insight into each presently arisen state, that
which is certain and unshakable, knows clearly and acts accordingly.</p>
<p>Today the effort must be made; tomorrow death may come, who knows?
There is no reprieve from the great commander-in-chief, the Lord of
Death.</p>
<p>One who dwells thus ardently, not idle, by day and by night – such a
person the Peaceful Sage has called one who prospers each and every
day.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn58">58</a></sup> {656}</p>
<p><em>Bhaddekaratta Sutta, M. III. 187-9.</em></p>
<p>[Those who have realized the Dhamma] do not sorrow over the past,
nor do they fantasize about the future. They maintain themselves with
what is present: hence their complexion is so bright.</p>
<p>As for fools, by fantasizing about the future, by mourning over the
past, they grow pale and dreary, like a fresh reed cut down and left
in the sun.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Note the mental attitude in respect to time of someone who is not
subject to craving as described in these preceding sutta passages, and
compare this with a wise engagement with the future as described in the
passages below. These include teachings on the everyday life of
laypeople as well as on the duties of the bhikkhus. They include both
personal and social responsibilities:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Doubt that which is doubtful;<br />
Prevent danger that has not yet come to pass.<br />
A wise person investigates both worlds,<br />
Because he considers future danger.</p>
<p><em>J. III. 35, 399.</em></p>
<p>One should never give up hope;<br />
A wise person should not become discouraged.<br />
I have clearly witnessed for myself that whatever I have wished for<br />
I have obtained to satisfaction.</p>
<p><em>E.g.: J. I. 267; J. IV. 269; J. VI. 43.</em></p>
<p>Complete your activities with heedfulness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn59">59</a></sup></p>
<p><em>The Buddha’s last words; D. II. 156.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Here is an example of how the monks should take the future into account
when performing their individual duties:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, when a monk discerns the following five future dangers, he
should indeed dwell with heedfulness, make effort, and dedicate
himself resolutely, in order to attain the unattained, to accomplish
the unaccomplished, to realize the unrealized. Which five?</p>
<p>Here, a monk considers in this way: ‘I am now young, a black-haired
young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life.
But there will come a time when old age assails this body. Now when
one is old, overcome by old age, it is not easy to attend to the
Buddhas’ teachings, it is not easy to resort to remote lodgings in
forests and jungle groves. Indeed, before this undesirable,
unpleasant, and unsatisfactory condition comes upon me, may I hasten
to rouse energy in order to attain the unattained.... When I have
fulfilled [this task], I will dwell at ease even though I am old...’</p>
<p>Again, a monk reflects thus: ‘I am now seldom ill or afflicted; I
possess an even metabolism and digestion that is neither too cool nor
too hot but moderate and suitable for striving. But there will come a
time when illness assails this body.... May I hasten to rouse
energy.... I will dwell at ease even though I am ill....’</p>
<p>Again, a monk reflects thus: ‘Food is now plentiful and almsfood is
abundant, so that one can easily subsist by going on almsround. But
there will come a time of famine, a poor harvest, when almsfood is
hard to obtain and one cannot easily subsist by going on almsround.
{657} People will migrate from a place of famine to places where food
is plentiful, and the monasteries there will be crowded and congested.
When living conditions are crowded and congested, it is not easy to
attend to the Buddhas’ teachings, it is not easy to resort to remote
lodgings in forests and jungle groves. Indeed ... may I hasten to
rouse energy.... I will dwell at ease even in a famine....’</p>
<p>Again, a monk reflects thus: ‘People are now dwelling in harmony,
living together happily, without disputes, blending like milk and
water, viewing each other with eyes of affection. But there will come
a time of peril, of disturbance and revolt in the frontiers, when the
people of the countryside, mounted on their vehicles, flee on all
sides. In a time of peril, people migrate to places of safety, and
living conditions there will be crowded and congested.... May I hasten
to rouse energy.... I will dwell at ease even in times of peril....’</p>
<p>Again, a monk reflects thus: ‘The sangha is now dwelling at ease – in
concord, harmoniously, without disputes, with a single Pāṭimokkha
recitation. But there will come a time when there will be a schism in
the sangha. Now when there is a schism in the sangha, it is not easy
to attend to the Buddhas’ teachings, it is not easy to resort to
remote lodgings in forests and jungle groves. Indeed ... may I hasten
to rouse energy.... I will dwell at ease even though there is a schism
in the sangha.’</p>
<p><em>A. III. 102-103.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Another sutta passage contains a teaching for monks who live in the
forest: by considering five potential dangers, they should live
vigilantly, make effort, and dedicate themselves resolutely in order to
fulfil the unfulfilled, attain the unattained, and realize the
unrealized. They should consider the future thus: ‘I live alone in the
forest. I may be bitten by a snake or centipede, stung by a scorpion, or
slip and fall. I may have food poisoning, a disturbance of bile or
phlegm, or a severe case of sunstroke. I may encounter a fierce animal
like a lion, tiger, or bear. I may meet a malevolent person or non-human
being and thus come to harm. I may even be killed due to one of these
causes. I should thus rouse energy to reach those states that I have not
yet reached.’</p>
<p>There is a similar teaching by the Buddha on contemplations for
safeguarding the future wellbeing of the community:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these five future dangers as yet unarisen that will
arise in the future. You should recognize them and make an effort to
prevent them. What five?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the future there will be monks who are undeveloped in body,
virtuous conduct, mind, and wisdom. They will give full ordination
to others but will not be able to train them in higher morality,
higher mind, and higher wisdom. These [pupils] too will be
undeveloped in body, virtuous conduct, mind, and wisdom. They in
turn will give full ordination to others but will not be able to
train them in higher morality, higher mind, and higher wisdom.
{658} These [pupils] too will be undeveloped in body, virtuous
conduct, mind, and wisdom. Thus, through corruption of the Dhamma
comes corruption of the Discipline, and from corruption of the
Discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, in the future there will be monks who are undeveloped in
body, virtuous conduct, mind, and wisdom. They will give
dependence<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn60">60</a></sup> to others but will not be able to train them in
higher morality, higher mind, and higher wisdom. These [pupils]
too will be undeveloped.... Thus, through corruption of the Dhamma
comes corruption of the Discipline, and from corruption of the
Discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, in the future there will be monks who are undeveloped in
body, virtuous conduct, mind, and wisdom. They will recite sermons
on the higher doctrine and on catechetical discourses, stumbling
into an incorrect Dhamma without being aware of it. Thus, through
corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the Discipline, and
from corruption of the Discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, in the future there will be monks who are undeveloped in
body, virtuous conduct, mind, and wisdom. When those discourses
spoken by the Tathāgata are being recited that are profound, deep
in meaning, world-transcending, connected with emptiness, they
will not listen attentively, will not lend an ear to them, or
apply their minds to understand them; they will not think those
teachings should be studied and learned. But when those discourses
are being recited that are mere poetry composed by poets,
beautiful in words and phrases, dealing with external matters,
spoken by disciples, they will listen attentively, lend an ear to
them, and apply their minds to understand them; they will think
those teachings should be studied and learned. Thus, through
corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the Discipline, and
from corruption of the Discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, in the future there will be monks who are undeveloped in
body, virtuous conduct, mind, and wisdom. The elder bhikkhus ...
will be greedy and lax, leaders in negligence, discarding the duty
of solitude; they will not arouse energy for attaining the
unattained, accomplishing the unaccomplished, or realizing the
unrealized. Those in the next generation will follow their
example. They, too, will be greedy and lax, leaders in negligence,
discarding the duty of solitude; they will not arouse energy....
Thus, through corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the
Discipline, and from corruption of the Discipline comes corruption
of the Dhamma.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These, monks, are the five future dangers as yet unarisen that will
arise in the future. You should recognize them and make an effort to
prevent them.</p>
<p><em>A. III. 105-106.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha gave another teaching on the future dangers for the monastic
community:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these five future dangers as yet unarisen that will
arise in the future. You should recognize them and make an effort to
prevent them. What five? {659}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the future there will be monks who desire fine robes. They will
give up the practice of wearing rag robes, give up remote lodgings
in forests and jungle groves, and having converged upon the
villages, towns, and capital cities, will take up their residence
there; and they will engage in many kinds of wrong and improper
pursuits for the sake of a robe....</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, in the future there will be monks who desire fine and
delicious almsfood.... Having converged upon the villages, towns,
and capital cities, will take up their residence there, seeking
the finest delicacies with the tips of their tongues, and they
will engage in many kinds of wrong and improper pursuits for the
sake of almsfood....</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, in the future there will be monks who desire beautiful and
extravagant lodgings.... They will engage in many kinds of wrong
and improper pursuits for the sake of lodgings....</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, in the future there will be monks who consort with
bhikkhunis, female probationers, and novices. When they consort in
this way, it can be expected that they will live the spiritual
life dissatisfied or give up the training and revert to the
household life...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, in the future there will be monks who fraternize with
monastery stewards and novices. When they fraternize in this way,
it can be expected that they will engage in the use of various
kinds of stored-up goods and give gross hints in regard to the
ground and vegetation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn61">61</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These, monks, are the five future dangers as yet unarisen that will
arise in the future. You should recognize them and make an effort to
prevent them.</p>
<p><em>A. III. 108-109.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These aforementioned explanations help to distinguish between thoughts
of the past and future that are subject to craving – that are
incoherent and fanciful, are a waste of time, and damage the quality of
the mind – and those thoughts of the past and future based on wisdom,
which are connected to present activities and are supportive to
spiritual practice.</p>
<p>When one practises according to these principles, one is able to make
effective preparations and plans for the future. This is made manifest
in the important historical activities of the monastic sangha. The first
recitation (<em>saṅgāyanā</em>), for example, came about because the monks gave
consideration to the future, which was connected to their present
responsibilities.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn62">62</a></sup> {660}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflection-corresponding-to-analytic-discussion-vibhajja-vāda" id="reflection-corresponding-to-analytic-discussion-vibhajja-vāda">Reflection Corresponding to Analytic Discussion (vibhajja-vāda)</a></h3>
<p>Analytic discussion (<em>vibhajja-vāda</em>) is not literally a method of
reflection, but rather a method of speaking or a method of describing
principles contained in specific teachings.</p>
<p>In any case, thinking and speaking are intimately connected actions.
Before one speaks, one must first think; speech is always preceded by
thought. There are Dhamma teachings designating applied thought
(<em>vitakka</em>) and sustained thought (<em>vicāra</em>) as the conditions shaping
speech (<em>vacī-saṅkhāra</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn63">63</a></sup> Thus, it is possible to discuss analytic
speech on the level of thought.</p>
<p>There are deeper meanings to the Pali word <em>vāda</em> (’speech’;
‘discussion’), pointing to patterns of thought which are the source of
entire systems of teachings, described as distinct doctrines, religions,
or philosophical traditions. For this reason, the term <em>vāda</em> is a
synonym for the term <em>diṭṭhi</em> (’view’). Therefore, the doctrine of
extreme realism (<em>sabbatthika-vāda</em>), for example, is equivalent to
<em>sabbatthika-diṭṭhi</em>, the doctrine of nihilism (<em>natthika-vāda</em>) is
equivalent to <em>natthika-diṭṭhi</em>, the doctrine of eternalism
(<em>sassata-vāda</em>) is equivalent to <em>sassata-diṭṭhi</em>, and the doctrine of
annihilationism (<em>uccheda-vāda</em>) is equivalent to <em>uccheda-diṭṭhi</em>.</p>
<p>The term <em>vibhajja-vāda</em> is an epithet for Buddhism. It is an important
term, indicating a Buddhist way of thinking. This way of thinking
encompasses many different kinds of reflection previously discussed in
this chapter. Besides introducing some new aspects of wise reflection, a
description of <em>vibhajja-vāda</em> also helps to understand the previous
kinds of reflection more clearly.</p>
<p>The reason that the term <em>vibhajja-vāda</em> is used as an epithet for
Buddhism, and is used to represent the Buddhist way of thinking, is most
likely because the Buddha referred to himself as an ‘analytic speaker’
(a speaker of reason; <em>vibhajja-vāda</em> or <em>vibhajja-vādī</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn64">64</a></sup> These
two terms, <em>vibhajja-vāda</em> and <em>vibhajja-vādī</em>, as epithets of the
Buddha or of Buddhism, have been cited throughout the history of
Buddhism. For example, at the Third Recitation, the emperor Asoka asked
Ven. Moggaliputta-Tissa Thera, the leader of the recitation, the
question: ‘What is the doctrine of the Perfectly Enlightened Buddha?’
The venerable elder answered: ‘Your Majesty, the Perfectly Enlightened
Buddha is a speaker of reason (<em>vibhajja-vādī</em>).’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn65">65</a></sup></p>
<p>In sum, one can say that <em>vibhajja-vāda</em> is a general term denoting the
entire spectrum of Buddhist thought.</p>
<p>The term <em>vibhajja</em> means to ‘separate’, ‘divide’, ‘distinguish’, or
‘analyze’. <em>Vāda</em> means ‘declaration’, ‘speaking’, ‘presenting a
teaching’, ‘system of teaching’, or ‘doctrine’. <em>Vibhajja-vāda</em> thus
translates as ‘discerning speech’, ‘discriminative speech’, or an
‘analytic system of teaching’.</p>
<p>The distinctive attribute of this kind of thinking and speaking is to
discern and to express the truth, by analyzing all aspects and features
of specific phenomena. One does not grasp onto a single aspect or a
limited number of aspects and then draw an imprecise, approximate
conclusion, nor does one hastily judge the value or goodness of
something by looking at a single perspective or at limited features.
{661}</p>
<p>Speech that is the opposite to <em>vibhajja-vāda</em> is called <em>ekaṁsa-vāda</em>,
which translates as ‘one-sided speech’. Here, one looks at only one
aspect, side, or part of a phenomenon and then draws a conclusion about
the object in its entirety, or one speaks based on stereotypes.</p>
<p>Analytic reflection (<em>vibhajja-vāda</em>) can be divided into different ways
of thinking:</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflecting-on-perspectives-of-truth" id="reflecting-on-perspectives-of-truth">Reflecting on Perspectives of Truth</a></h3>
<p>This way of thinking can be subdivided into two factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To distinguish various aspects of an object as they truly are; to
discern or describe the truth as it manifests in those aspects; to
abstain from grasping onto limited features of an object and then
drawing an incomplete assessment of it. For instance, when one
describes another person as being good or bad, one points to
specific facts, by saying: ‘In such areas, aspects, and
circumstances he is good or bad.’ One refrains from making simple
generalizations. If one judges the value of something, one
determines which aspects to focus on; one then considers these
aspects and makes a relative assessment. An example of this kind of
analysis is found in the teaching on the ten kinds of householders,
which will be discussed below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To discern or describe the truth of an object based on all of its
features. When one looks at or considers an object, one is not
blinkered; one is not stuck at one aspect or part of it; nor does
one judge something based on limited features; instead one looks at
something from all angles. For example, when one judges something as
good or bad, one says: ‘It is good in these ways, these aspects,
these situations; it is not good in these ways, aspects, or
situations.’ Although this second factor appears similar to the
first, it is distinct; moreover, it reinforces and completes the
first factor. Examples of this kind of analysis are the teaching on
the ten kinds of householders and the teaching on praiseworthy and
blameworthy monks, both forest monks and village monks.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn66">66</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This way of thinking leads to an understanding of how various factors or
attributes gather together into an integrated whole, thus giving rise to
a particular phenomenon or event, and it leads to a broad discernment of
things or events, by seeing how these things are composed of various
factors.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflecting-on-component-factors" id="reflecting-on-component-factors">Reflecting on Component Factors</a></h3>
<p>Here, one analyzes an object in order to gain a thorough understanding
of it, as something that exists as a collection of subsidiary factors.
One is not stuck on external appearances, nor is one deceived by the
overall image of an object. For example, one separates a person into
body (<em>rūpa</em>) and mind (<em>nāma</em>), or into the five aggregates, and
further analyzes each factor until one sees the characteristic of
nonself. This is the path to fully comprehending the truth of
conditioned phenomena.</p>
<p>This form of analytical thinking (<em>vibhajja-vāda</em>) is the same as the
second kind of reflection (the method of analyzing component factors)
described earlier in this chapter, so it is not necessary to expand on
it here. The term <em>vibhajja-vāda</em> was not originally used to denote an
analysis of component factors, but authors of later texts used it in
this broader sense,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn67">67</a></sup> and thus I have included it in this discussion.
{662}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflecting-on-the-sequence-of-momentary-events" id="reflecting-on-the-sequence-of-momentary-events">Reflecting on the Sequence of Momentary Events</a></h3>
<p>Here, one analyzes phenomena according to the succession of causes and
conditions, by separating events into distinct ‘moments’ (<em>khaṇa</em>), in
order to see the actual causes and conditions leading to a specific
phenomenon.</p>
<p>This way of thinking is one part of the reflection on component factors
and of the reflection on the relationship between causes and conditions
(see below), but it has some unique characteristics and application, and
is therefore given a distinct classification. It is applied frequently
in the study of the Abhidhamma.</p>
<p>Take for example the case of a thief breaking into a house and killing
the owner. Generally, people will say that the thief murdered the person
because of greed – because of a desire for the wealth in the house; the
cause for the murder is greed.</p>
<p>This explanation is a simplified way of speaking. When one investigates
the true dynamics at play in the thief’s mind, one sees that this
explanation is inaccurate. It is not possible for greed to be a cause
for killing; anger, rather, is the cause for killing. By analyzing the
sequence of momentary events, one sees that the thief covets the wealth,
but the owner is an obstacle for obtaining it. Greed for the wealth is
thus the cause for the thief to be angry at the owner. The murder is
committed because of this anger.</p>
<p>The thief covets the wealth – he does not covet the owner of the
wealth. Greed is not the real cause of the murder; it is simply a cause
for stealing. And it is a condition giving rise to anger towards that
which gets in its way or does not support its objectives.</p>
<p>In everyday parlance it is fine to say that the thief killed the person
out of greed. But it is important to understand that according to the
true sequence of momentary events, greed is simply a root cause or an
initial agent in that situation. This analysis or investigation of
momentary occurrences is the reason why Buddhism in later periods has
been referred to as a ‘doctrine of momentary events’ (’doctrine of
change’; <em>khaṇika-vāda</em>).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflecting-on-the-interrelationship-of-causes-and-conditions" id="reflecting-on-the-interrelationship-of-causes-and-conditions">Reflecting on the Interrelationship of Causes and Conditions</a></h3>
<p>Here, one traces the various interrelated, connected causes and
conditions of an object or phenomenon. This investigation gives rise to
an understanding that things do not arise and exist at random; they do
not exist independently from other things; they are not self-sufficient,
but rather depend on causes and conditions. They cease to exist and are
transient because their causes and conditions likewise cease.</p>
<p>This vital form of thinking corresponds to the first kind of reflection
mentioned above, of investigating causes and conditions, or thinking in
line with ‘specific conditionality’ (<em>idappaccayatā</em>). Besides having
described this way of thinking earlier in this chapter, it was also
explained at length in the chapter on Dependent Origination.</p>
<p>Thinking that lacks this awareness of the relative nature of things
leads people to various forms of extreme views. For example, they hold
to an eternalist view, believing that there exists a true, eternal soul,
or to an annihilationist view, believing that the ‘self’ exists
temporarily but then is extinguished and disappears. When one neglects
to see the interrelationship of causes and conditions, one sees things
as absolute and in isolation, which results in extreme views.</p>
<p>Things, however, do not exist in an absolute sense as generally
interpreted by people. All things are interrelated, interdependent, and
interconnected on account of subsidiary factors. The existence or
non-existence of a thing is not definite or absolute. The truth of the
matter is somewhere in the middle, between the two aforementioned
extremes. This way of reflection helps one to discern this truth. {663}</p>
<p>According to this way of thinking, the Buddha proclaimed an ‘objective’
or ‘middle’ teaching. He did not say, ‘This exists’ or ‘This does not
exist’, but rather stated: ‘Because this exists that also exists;
because this does not exist, that too does not exist’, or: ‘This exists
when that too exists; this does not exist when that does not exist.’</p>
<p>This principle of truth is referred to as ‘specific conditionality’
(<em>idappaccayatā</em>) or ‘dependent origination’ (<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>), and
the teaching of this truth is called the ‘middle teaching’
(<em>majjhena-dhammadesanā</em>). This way of thinking can thus be called
reflection corresponding to the middle teaching or reflection in line
with the ‘middle truth’ (<em>majjhena-dhamma</em>).</p>
<p>Besides preventing one from seeing things or problems in an isolated,
absolute sense, and helping one to think in a smooth, unobstructed way,
a reflection on the relationship between causes and conditions helps one
to recognize and match causes and conditions with their respective
results.</p>
<p>This subject matter is connected to three common areas of confusion for
people:</p>
<p>First, people often mix up matters external to an event with those
causes and conditions specifically related to it. For example, in the
case that an immoral person reaps some kind of reward that is generally
considered to be good, some people will raise the question why someone
else who is virtuous, who has many good qualities, does not receive this
good fortune. The truth of the matter is that the specific virtuous
qualities of this good person may not be of the kind that generates the
aforementioned reward. This kind of reflection helps to distinguish
unrelated matters or conditions from those causes and conditions
directly pertaining to a specific circumstance. One accurately sees the
relationship between results and their causes.</p>
<p>Second, people are often not aware of how different causes and
conditions can lead to similar results, and how the same causes and
conditions may not always lead to the same results. For example, the
Buddha encouraged some monks to live alone in the forest, while for
other monks he discouraged this. He reflected on the motive (the
‘cause’), that is, the specific monk’s intention.</p>
<p>The acquisition of wealth may result from diligence and hard work, from
pleasing a wealthy donor, or from theft. A person may be praised because
he acts virtuously in a society that honours virtue, or he may be
praised even as a result of doing bad actions, if they satisfy someone
else’s desires.</p>
<p>In these situations it is necessary to recognize how these variant
causes and conditions giving rise to similar results also generate
other, distinct results which one may not have taken into account.</p>
<p>Similarly, two people may perform the same good actions. The first
person is praised because he lives in a place where people honour
goodness, or his actions are advantageous to those offering the praise.
The second person, however, is not praised, because he lives in a place
where such goodness is not esteemed, or his actions threaten the
personal interests of others, or else he possesses some personal faults.</p>
<p>In these situations it is also important to realize that the causes and
conditions being considered are not the sole causes and conditions
giving rise to the specific results. The environment and other factors
are also accompanying conditions, which determine the arising or
non-arising of these results. {664}</p>
<p>Third, people often do not realize the special causes and conditions
additional to those similar causes. This is connected to the second
factor, above, that is, people generally only acknowledge those things
that they reckon will produce specific results. For example, when they
see two people act in the same way, after which one person receives a
desired result while the other person does not, they conclude that this
action (this ‘cause &amp; condition’) does not produce dependable,
trustworthy results.</p>
<p>There may be a case when two people, who are both equally good at a job,
are eligible for promotion. It is natural that only one of these two
will be selected. If the selection is not made by casting lots, other
conditions will come into play; one person may be healthier, have a
better physical appearance, or be more intelligent, for instance.</p>
<p>The examples given here in reference to these three areas of confusion
are connected to the law of kamma, to people’s volitional actions and
their results, but other examples having to do with general laws of
cause and effect would be equally applicable.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflecting-on-prerequisites-and-qualifications" id="reflecting-on-prerequisites-and-qualifications">Reflecting on Prerequisites and Qualifications</a></h3>
<p>This commonly encountered form of analytical reflection refers to
discerning or expressing the truth by considering accompanying
prerequisites and qualifications. For example, in the case that these
questions are posed: ‘Should one associate with these people or not?’ or
‘Should one frequent this place or not? – if the person who answers is
a monk, he may answer in accord with the Pali Canon and say: ‘If by
associating with such persons or places unwholesome states increase and
wholesome states decrease, then one should avoid them, but if wholesome
states increase and unwholesome states decrease, one should seek them
out.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn68">68</a></sup></p>
<p>In answer to the question: ‘Should a monk observe the austere practices
(<em>dhutaṅga</em>)?’ – someone who knows the Dhamma well will say: ‘If a
monk’s meditation improves, then he should observe these practices; if
it deteriorates, then he should not. If a monk’s meditation improves
regardless of whether he observes these practices or not, and if he
wishes to assist later generations, then he should observe them. If a
monk’s meditation deteriorates regardless of whether he observes these
practices or not, he should observe them to establish a basis for his
personal disposition.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn69">69</a></sup></p>
<p>If someone were to ask whether the Buddha is a proponent of
annihilationism (<em>uccheda-vāda</em>), by answering according to the Buddha’s
own words, one would say: ‘If you are using this term in this
definition, then “yes,” but if you are using it in this other
definition, then “no”.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn70">70</a></sup> Similarly, if someone were to ask whether a
monk who likes to live in solitude and to wander alone can be called one
who practises correctly according to the Buddha’s teachings, one would
need to answer by stating certain qualifications.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn71">71</a></sup></p>
<p>Taking an example from modern studies of education, the question comes
up whether to allow children to encounter particular social influences,
like news or shows broadcast by the media, without any supervision, or
to what extent they should be supervised. If one answers with analytical
reflection, one does not speak rashly or in an ill-considered way, but
rather examines this matter by taking certain conditions into account,
for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proclivities, skills, habits, and traits that a child has
accumulated through his or her education and nurturing, as well as
cultural influences present at that time. Technically speaking, this
refers to wholesome and unwholesome ‘volitional formations’
(<em>saṅkhāra</em>): habitual ways of thinking. In short, this refers to
the child’s disposition. {665}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To what extent is the child able to apply wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtuous friends (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>): does the child have a person or
other means of support for offering advice on important matters, for
example by pointing out correct ways of examining things or by
helping to generate wise reflection? These virtuous friends may
exist in the child’s family or community, or they may exert an
influence by way of the media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To what extent are those things which the child is exposed to
provocative, offensive, or seductive?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All four of these factors are variables, but in this case we may hold
the fourth factor to be constant. The answers to the aforementioned
questions are relative. For example, if the child applies wise
reflection, or he or she has access to a truly capable virtuous friend
(especially by way of the media itself), or his or her wholesome way of
thinking instilled by family or culture is firmly established, even if
the child is exposed to a great deal of stimulation and allurements, it
will be difficult for these to cause problems and they may even generate
positive results.</p>
<p>If, however, an inclination to think in wholesome ways has not been
cultivated, the child has not been trained in wise reflection, and he or
she has not been equipped with a virtuous friend, abandoning children to
these influences causes problems for them and is tantamount to giving
them mental poison.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reflecting-on-alternatives-and-other-possibilities" id="reflecting-on-alternatives-and-other-possibilities">Reflecting on Alternatives and Other Possibilities</a></h3>
<p>When trying to achieve something or to reach some goal, or when trying
to understand the existence of some phenomenon, a person should be aware
of the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There may be many ways to reach this goal, or there may be different
possibilities for this phenomenon to exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of these different methods or possibilities, some of them may be
better, more effective, or more decisive than others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of these different methods, some of them, or one of them, may be
more appropriate or effective for oneself, for other people, or for
particular situations, than other methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There may be one or several methods to achieve this goal, or one or
several possibilities for something to exist, but it may be
different from the method that one currently practises, or different
from the possibility one currently perceives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This awareness has many benefits: it keeps one from getting stuck,
turning in circles, and finding no way out in respect to fruitless,
incorrect, or inappropriate ways of practice or thought patterns; and,
when one acts or thinks in ways that are unsuccessful, it prevents one
from giving up out of discouragement or a sense of helplessness.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it enables one to search for and discover methods or
possibilities that are correct, appropriate, precise, practical and
effective.</p>
<p>An example of this way of reflection can be seen in the life account of
the Buddha. When he endeavoured as a bodhisatta to practise the severe
austerities, which were considered an ideal at that time era, with all
his strength and to an extreme, he was unsuccessful. Instead of getting
frustrated and despairing, he recognized that this is not the correct
path for reaching the goal and then reflected further. {666}</p>
<p>At that time he had this thought:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>By this racking practice of austerities I have not attained any
superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and vision making for
being a noble one. There must be another path to awakening.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 246.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>After having this thought, he discovered the Middle Way, which he
practised until reaching the knowledge of awakening (<em>bodhi-ñāṇa</em>).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#detailed-analysis-as-a-response-to-questions" id="detailed-analysis-as-a-response-to-questions">Detailed Analysis as a Response to Questions</a></h3>
<p>Detailed analysis (<em>vibhajja-vāda</em>) appears frequently in the scriptures
as a response to questions, and is classified as one of the four
responses to questions. Applying detailed analysis to answer a question
is given the special term <em>vibhajja-vyākaraṇa</em>: ‘analytical
explanation’.</p>
<p>Here are the four ways of answering a question (<em>pañhā-vyākaraṇa</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Ekaṁsa-vyākaraṇa</em>: to answer from a ‘single perspective’; to answer
in a decisive, categorical sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vibhajja-vyākaraṇa</em>: to answer by detailed analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paṭipucchā-vyākaraṇa</em>: to answer by posing a question in return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ṭhapana</em>: to refrain from answering; to desist; to dismiss the
question.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These four kinds of answers correspond with four kinds of questions,
which are listed here along with simple examples given in later
texts:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn72">72</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Ekaṁsavyākaraṇīya-pañhā</em>: questions that should be answered
decisively and categorically. For example, to the question: ‘Is the
eye impermanent?’ – one should answer absolutely and directly:
‘Yes.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vibhajjavyākaraṇīya-pañhā</em>: questions that should be answered by
way of analysis or categorization. For example, to the question:
‘That which is impermanent is the eye, correct?’ – one should
answer: ‘Not only the eye; the ear, nose, etc. are also
impermanent.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paṭipucchāvyākaraṇīya-pañhā</em>: questions to be answered by
questions. For example, to the question: ‘The eye is the same as the
ear, correct?’ – one should ask in return: ‘Which aspect are you
referring to? If you are referring to the faculty of seeing, then
“No,” but if you are referring to the state of being impermanent,
then “Yes”.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ṭhapanīya-pañhā</em>: questions which should be dismissed and not
answered. For example, to the question: ‘Is the physical body
(<em>sarīra</em>) the same as the life principle (<em>jīva</em>)?’ – one should
desist from answering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In respect to the first kind of question, it does not require an
explanation, or it has no exceptions. It can thus be answered
immediately and absolutely. Another example is the question: ‘Everyone
has to die, correct?’ – here one can answer immediately, ‘Yes.’</p>
<p>The second kind of question has aspects that need to be explained by
using the various kinds of detailed analysis described above.</p>
<p>In respect to the third kind of question, one should make inquiries in
return, in order to seek clarity before answering. This method can be
used in conjunction with the second kind of response, of answering by
detailed analysis. {667}</p>
<p>In the Pali Canon the Buddha frequently uses this method of replying to
a question with another question. By doing this, the questioner was
gradually able to understand and answer his own question. The Buddha
simply pointed out particular frames of reference or new perspectives,
without needing to answer the question directly.</p>
<p>The fourth kind of question, to which one should desist from answering,
refers to senseless, foolish, or absurd questions. Alternatively, it
refers to those matters the questioner is not yet capable of
understanding. Here, it is better to first instil a basic understanding
of other matters. Later one may be able to speak about the original
question, or else the person understands the matter by himself.</p>
<p>On a more subtle level are those questions incorrectly posed which stem
from a misunderstanding and are incongruous with truth.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn73">73</a></sup> Examples
from the Pali Canon include such questions as: ‘Who cognizes?’ ‘Whose
cognition?’ ‘Who experiences sense objects?’ and ‘Whose feelings?’ One
is unable to answer these questions in a way that the questioner
desires, and thus it is better to dismiss these questions. One may
explain the reasons for not answering,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn74">74</a></sup> or ask the questioner to
reformulate the question so that it accords with reality.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn75">75</a></sup></p>
<p>Following are some passages from the Pali Canon describing ‘detailed
analysis’ (<em>vibhajja-vāda</em>):</p>
<div class="sutta">

<p>Ven. Ānanda went on almsround and entered the house of the female lay
disciple Migasālā, who said to him:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Venerable sir, Ānanda, just how should this teaching of the Blessed
One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not
celibate both have exactly the same destination in their future life?</p>
<p>My father Purāṇa was celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual
intercourse, the common person’s practice. When he died, the Blessed
One declared: ‘He is a being who is a once-returner and has been
reborn in the Tusita group of devas.’</p>
<p>My father’s dear friend Isidatta was not celibate but lived contented
with his wife. When he died, the Blessed One also declared: ‘He is a
being who is a once-returner and has been reborn in the Tusita group
of devas.’</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Ven. Ānanda acknowledged this question but he did not answer; instead he
brought this matter to the Buddha. The Buddha explained that to
understand this matter one must be able to distinguish between different
kinds of people. (One must possess the knowledge that fathoms the
superior and inferior qualities of different people –
<em>purisapuggalaparopariya-ñāṇa</em>). {671}</p>
<p>The Buddha went on to describe six types of people, organized into three
pairs, (and in a second sutta he describes ten types of people,
organized into five pairs). In regard to each one of these pairs, the
individuals share certain attributes (especially those connected to
interpersonal or social relationships), but in other areas they have
distinctive attributes (especially personal qualities which correspond
with beneficial results).</p>
<p>Those who are judgemental will conclude: ‘These two people have similar
attributes. Why is one person more successful than the other?’ Such an
assessment will lead to their harm.</p>
<p>By focusing on external attributes, Purāṇa appears to be superior to
Isidatta, but their essential internal attributes are the same. They are
both endowed with the same essential qualities in relation to virtuous
conduct (<em>sīla</em>), and they are also endowed with the same level of
wisdom.</p>
<p><em>A. III. 347-351; A. V. 137-8.</em></p>
<p>In a similar way, the Buddha divided householders – ‘those who enjoy
sensual pleasures’ (<em>kāma-bhogī</em>) – into ten types, and he described
the positive and negative aspects of each of these types:</p>
<p><strong>Group #1</strong>: Those who seek wealth unrighteously:</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Some people seek wealth unrighteously, and once they acquire wealth
they do not make themselves happy, nor do they share their wealth
and do meritorious deeds. They are blameworthy on three counts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Some people seek wealth unrighteously; once they acquire wealth they
make themselves happy, but they do not share their wealth nor do
they do meritorious deeds. They are blameworthy on two counts, and
praiseworthy on one count.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Some people seek wealth unrighteously; once they acquire wealth they
make themselves happy, and they both share their wealth and do

<p>This kind of analytic reflection (<em>vibhajja-vāda</em>) leads to clear and
precise thinking and discrimination, which accords and is commensurate
with truth, and prevents confusion.</p>
<p>A simple example from everyday life is the observation that someone
speaks directly, bluntly, and outspokenly, and is unable to speak in a
sweet-sounding way; it appears as if he covers up his bluntness and
abrupt speech in the cloak of frankness. If one analyzes this situation
more closely, one can conclude that his candidness and directness is a
virtue, but the abruptness and outspokenness is a fault.</p>
<p>Someone endowed with such qualities should acknowledge the deficiency in
not speaking agreeably, rather than using directness as a pretext. If
one wishes to bring virtue to fulfilment, one should make adjustments in
those areas that are still faulty.</p>
<p>Similarly, someone who speaks in a pleasing, sweet-sounding way is
endowed with such pleasant speech as a virtue, but it is another matter
whether one speaks candidly. If one does, this is considered another
virtue, but if one does not, then this is considered a fault.</p>
<p>In such a case, an additional factor which needs to be considered is
whether this sweet-speaking person speaks with wholesome intentions or
whether he speaks out of a wish to deceive, using a ruse. One should
distinguish this factor with clarity, to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>In the case that one is looking to hire someone for a job, one chooses
the candidate suitable to the job’s requirements – whether one needs
someone who speaks pleasantly or someone who speaks directly. If the job
requires a person who speaks pleasantly, one selects someone with this
quality (of course the employer will also try to find someone who is
honest). An outspoken person here needs not allude to his directness as
a way to get this job. Likewise, if the job requires a person who speaks
directly, it is unimportant whether the candidate speaks pleasantly or
not. The person not chosen for this job need not cite his soft-spoken,
agreeable speech. Moreover, if one is making a psychological study, by
looking at the relationship between directness and bluntness, or between
sweet-sounding speech and deceit, one should be clear about those
factors under investigation.</p>
<p>Analytic reflection (<em>vibhajja-vāda</em>) is precise and objective,
corresponds with truth, and is aligned with natural laws. It is thus a
model for those who wish to speak in a truly open and honest way.</p>

<p>There was a bhikkhu named Thera who lived alone and spoke in praise of
the merits of living alone. He went to the village on alms alone,
returned to his residence alone, sat in seclusion alone, and practised
walking meditation alone. Many monks went to the Buddha to ask about
this monk. The Buddha sent for Ven. Thera and conducted the following
conversation:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> Is it true, Thera, that you are a lone dweller and speak in
praise of dwelling alone?</p>
<p><em>Ven. Thera:</em> Yes, venerable sir.</p>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> But how, Thera, are you a lone dweller and how do you speak
in praise of dwelling alone?</p>
<p><em>Thera:</em> Here, venerable sir, I enter the village for alms alone, I
return alone, I sit alone in seclusion, and I practise walking
mediation alone. It is in such a way that I am a lone dweller and
speak in praise of dwelling alone.</p>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> That is a way of dwelling alone, Elder, I do not deny this.
But as to how dwelling alone is fulfilled in detail, listen to that
and attend closely, I will speak.... Here, what lies in the past has
been abandoned, what lies in the future has been relinquished, and
delight and attachment for present forms of individual existence has
been thoroughly removed. It is in such a way that dwelling alone is
fulfilled in detail.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn85">85</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. II. 282-3.</em></p>
<p><em>Ven. Migajāla:</em> Venerable sir, it is said, ‘a lone dweller, a lone
dweller.’ In what way is one a lone dweller, and in what way is one
dwelling with a companion?</p>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> There are, Migajāla, forms cognizable by the eye ... sounds
cognizable by the ear ... odours cognizable by the nose ... tastes
cognizable by the tongue ... tactile objects cognizable by the body
... mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are desirable,
lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a
monk seeks delight in them, frets over them, and welcomes them,
delight (nandi) arises. When there is delight, there is infatuation.
When there is infatuation, there is bondage (saṁyojana). Bound by
delight and attachment, a monk is called one dwelling with a
companion.</p>
<p>Even though a monk who dwells thus resorts to remote forest lodgings,
where there are few sounds and little noise, desolate, hidden from
people, appropriate for privacy and seclusion, he is still called one
dwelling with a companion. For what reason? Because craving is his
companion, and he has not abandoned it; therefore he is called one
dwelling with a companion.</p>

<p>Note that such excerpts from the Tipiṭaka demonstrating the Buddhist
point of view in relation to analytic reflection can sometimes lead
people to see only a limited and incomplete picture of Buddhism and to
misunderstand it. For this reason, those people who attempt to describe
the Buddhist teachings should cite scriptural passages with care. They
should be able to distinguish between those teachings which express
universal or general principles, and those which pertain to specific
aspects or circumstances, or which have restrictions. They should
provide a complete set of examples, or explain the relevant
circumstances or qualifications, so that the reader or listener
understands Buddhism correctly. {676}</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#practical-application" id="practical-application">Practical Application</a></h2>
<p>Following on from the preceding descriptions of the various kinds of
wise reflection, there are some miscellaneous points here to review and
reemphasize.</p>
<p>By examining how wise reflection operates, one sees that it functions
during two stages: first, when one cognizes sense impressions or when
one experiences things from outside, and second, when one contemplates
sense impressions or when one examines matters that one has stored up
internally.</p>
<p>One of the noteworthy characteristics of cognizing things wisely is to
simply know them accurately, and to provide mindfulness with useful data
to use in one’s everyday life and activities.</p>
<p>In other words, one cognizes things for the benefit of mindfulness and
wisdom. This differs from cognition that leads to misunderstanding,
conflict, attachment, and mental corruption. One gains knowledge as a
result of one’s experiences, rather than allowing experiences or sense
impressions to dominate or delude the mind. Otherwise, instead of
gaining knowledge in order to solve problems and to eliminate suffering,
one accumulates mental defilement and intensifies suffering. These same
principles also apply to the act of thinking and they help to
distinguish a life conducted with wisdom.</p>
<p>Some people may complain that this so-called life of wisdom appears
emotionless, barren, and insipid. A response to this is that emotions
tend to dominate the lives of ordinary people almost continuously. Wise
reflection simply eases peoples suffering and mitigates their problems.
There is no worry that they will be void of emotions.</p>
<p>Someone who applies wise reflection successfully, to the extent of
transcending the state of an ordinary person (<em>puthujjana</em>), develops
the prominent, pure, and powerful emotion of true compassion, which
augments a person’s goodness and kindness. Instead of such emotions as
frustration, sadness, stress, loneliness, and worry, one feels more
refined emotions like joy, delight, happiness, mental clarity and
spaciousness, peace, and inner freedom.</p>
<p>Note that the two preliminary stages of the Middle Way – advantageous
instruction from others and wise reflection – comprise the link between
people and the world. They emphasize one’s external environment, before
one enters upon the Noble Eightfold Path, which consists of internal
factors.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn88">88</a></sup></p>
<p>Virtuous friendship (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em> = ‘wholesome instruction from
others’) highlights the correct relationship between people and and the
world in respect to their community, and wise reflection highlights the
correct relationship between people and the world from the perspective
of the mind, that is, of the way in which one experiences sense
impressions and the way in which one thinks. This latter factor refers
to the way of wisdom, or of discerning things as they really are, as
explained earlier.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn89">89</a></sup></p>
<p>The different kinds of wise reflection described above follow the
presentations in the Buddhist scriptures. It is important that students
of Buddhism not get stuck on these conventional formats or on a set
terminology, but rather focus on the essential meaning of these
teachings.</p>
<p>Note also that the principles of wise reflection are intended to be used
in a practical way, offering continuous benefit to one’s life. They are
not meant to be used only when one is faced with tricky matters for
consideration or when one is in solitude. Rather they can be applied at
all times. {677}</p>
<p>This process begins with one’s general relationship to people and to the
world, and with the course of one’s thoughts and reflections when one
experiences various things – of not creating suffering, generating
problems, or causing harm. Instead, one’s thoughts and actions promote
happiness for oneself and others, increase wisdom and other wholesome
qualities, cultivate virtuous habits and personal attributes, foster
knowledge of the truth, and tie in with a spiritual training leading to
liberation.</p>
<p>Take for an example a young boy from a wealthy family sitting in a car
along with his parents. At one point he looks out the window and sees a
group of poor children dressed in rags. The boy is fascinated because he
recognizes the difference between himself and those other children. His
parents notice his interest and say: ‘Those are filthy children; don’t
pay attention to them.’</p>
<p>In such a circumstance the parents are equivalent to bad friends
(<em>pāpa-mitta</em>), advising the child to think in an unwise manner and
inducing unwholesome states like aversion and contempt. These negative
feelings may develop into the boy’s general viewpoint towards poor
people, or even into a bias against all people.</p>
<p>In the same kind of circumstances, however, another set of parents may
say: ‘Those unfortunate children. Their parents are poor and therefore
they do not have any decent clothes to wear. We should try and help
them.’</p>
<p>In this case the parents act as virtuous friends (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>),
helping to establish the child in wise reflection and inducing wholesome
qualities like lovingkindness, compassion, and renunciation. These
positive feelings may develop into the child’s outlook towards poor
people and into his general perspective towards all people.</p>
<p>The same holds true in other situations. Take for example the way in
which news is broadcast in the media, both in relation to good news and
bad; the expressed attitudes and speech by adults is highly influential
in shaping the thought patterns of children. If adults point out correct
ways of thinking and a discernment that is aligned with truth and
conducive to wholesome qualities, the spiritual growth of children will
be greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>Food, clothing, textbooks, the road to school, and those people or
events encountered on the way to school – all of these things can
influence the thoughts and shape a wholesome or unwholesome response in
children. Very important in this context, however, is the way in which
the perspectives and values of children are moulded by the advice given
to them by both virtuous and immoral companions, leading to either wise
or unwise reflection.</p>
<p>As for adults, when they understand these principles they will be able
to apply wise reflection to rectify negative attitudes and habits, even
those which have been accumulated and compounded by unwise reflection
for a long time.</p>
<p>Note also that in the same situation, where several people all apply
wise reflection, the kinds and levels of wise reflection may differ.</p>
<p>Take an example connected to the two stages of tranquillity (<em>samatha</em>)
and insight (<em>vipassanā</em>). One man sees the face of a beautiful young
woman, but instead of focusing on the beauty of her face he sees it as
comprised of skin and facial hair, along with the unattractive elements
of grease, sweat and dust, and with bones and flesh beneath. In this
way, lust does not arise in him. The wise reflection applied here is
considered an aspect of tranquillity meditation (reflection on the
repulsive – <em>paṭikkūla-manasikāra</em>), because the experience is of the
repulsive quelling lust, leading to a peaceful mind.</p>
<p>A second man sees the same beautiful woman, but he sees her as a young
person who ought to be looked after and cared for. He generates the
feeling of lovingkindness, considering her like a younger sister or
niece. The wise reflection applied here is also an aspect of
tranquillity meditation (an expression of the divine abiding of
lovingkindness), because it makes the mind peaceful and pure. {678}</p>
<p>A woman sees this beautiful woman and thinks: ‘Her face is more
beautiful than mine.’ She begins to feel envy and dislike. This is a
form of unwise reflection, because it generates unwholesome states and
causes suffering and anguish.</p>
<p>A third man sees this woman and sees her face as comprised of various
physical parts made up of different elements; as a whole they are
conventionally referred to as the face of this woman with such-and-such
a name. This woman’s face is nothing more than a physical thing – it is
impermanent, unstable, subject to change, existing according to causes
and conditions, morally neutral; ultimately, it is neither beautiful nor
repulsive. This kind of reflection is in line with insight meditation,
because the person sees the object as it really is or according to the
truth.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn90">90</a></sup></p>
<p>Wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) is the principal factor initiating
spiritual training, or it is the pillar of wisdom development,
especially in systematic or formal study. It should thus be given great
importance. One should help people seek knowledge themselves, rather
than try to ‘educate’ people by telling them what to think or believe,
which is often a misguided and fruitless effort.</p>
<p>To begin with one can develop educational methods and activities that
encourage students to train in the two basic forms of wise reflection:
the investigation of causes and conditions and the analysis of component
factors.</p>
<p>When the students encounter situations requiring contemplation they can
link these two kinds of reflection with the reflection in accord with
the three universal characteristics and the reflection used to solve
problems (reflection in accord with the Four Noble Truths). The other
kinds of reflection then provide support as is suitable. With this
guidance the students begin to apply wise reflection independently and
progress in spiritual practice truly and correctly.</p>
<p>When teachers know how to incorporate wise reflection in their
curriculum, even young children will develop a profound thinking and
broad perspective. By looking at their notebooks and writing desks they
will begin to see the interrelationship and interdependence between all
things in the universe. They will discern that the arising and existence
of one thing does not happen in isolation; it is inseparable from the
existence of other things.</p>
<p>In answer to the questions, ‘How did this desk come to be?’ ‘What is
required in order for this desk to come into existence?’ a child will
trace back to the necessary causes and search for all the factors
required in the creation of a desk, for example: wood, a saw, nails, a
hammer, and human labourers. From these they will trace even further
back, say from the wood to trees, and from trees to soil, water, rain,
forests, climate and weather.</p>
<p>Besides giving rise to a clear understanding of subjects under
consideration, and of all their related factors, a skill in wise
reflection also leads to insight and realization which effectuates
change even on the level of viewpoints and personality. For example, one
realizes that to live well and experience true happiness one must
respect other people and respect nature, and carefully protect and
preserve natural resources. {679}</p>
<p>Those people skilled at wise reflection will look for and recognize
those aspects of things that are beneficial, and apply them for
wellbeing and prosperity in their lives at all times and in all
circumstances.</p>
<p>Despite encountering poverty, illness, or misfortune, these people do
not feel discouraged or helpless. Instead, these difficult and
challenging experiences become the source of wisdom and other virtues.
Indeed, one sometimes hears people say: ‘It was good luck that I was
born poor’ or ‘It was good luck that I became so ill at that time.’
Similarly, there are stories in the scriptures of some people who hear
the words of a madman and consequently realize the truth and are
completely freed from mental impurity.</p>
<p>Conversely, some people, despite being born rich, physically beautiful,
or with prestige, lack wise reflection. Instead of their apparent good
luck acting as an asset or support for achieving true success with speed
and convenience, it increases and intensifies craving, conceit and wrong
view, along with fostering laziness, infatuation, and competitiveness.
Their good luck is transformed into bad luck and they find no true
fulfilment.</p>
<p>Most people have accumulated the habit over a long period of time of
thinking in ways that satisfy craving, or thinking based on likes and
dislikes, preferences and aversions. These different kinds of wise
reflection help to train the mind to develop new habits.</p>
<p>Developing new habits may take a long time, because old habits have been
accumulated for decades. But the effort is worthwhile, because wise
reflection increases wisdom, solves problems, dispels delusion and
suffering, and generates joy and luminosity.</p>
<p>Even if not perfected, wise reflection can still aid in fostering
equilibrium and providing a way out when old habits lead one into
trouble and to various forms of suffering; it helps one to turn towards
safety and freedom.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, from the perspective of functionality, the various
kinds of wise reflection can be classified into two types:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reflection cultivating power of mind: this type of reflection aims
for mobilizing virtuous, wholesome qualities; it emphasizes
hindering or suppressing craving; it belongs to tranquillity
meditation (<em>samatha</em>); its characteristic is generating the
strength or degree of goodness to constrain or conceal the
unwholesome; its results are temporary and dependent on time; it
promotes spiritual preparedness and builds character; and it leads
to mundane right view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflection cultivating pure wisdom: this type of reflection aims for
comprehensive knowledge of the truth or of reality; it emphasizes
the eradication of ignorance; it belongs to insight meditation
(<em>vipassanā</em>); its characteristic is illumination, of dispelling
delusion or cleansing what is impure; its fruits are timeless or
absolute; and it leads to transcendent right view. {680}</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The Buddhist teachings describe many methods of wise reflection, which
can be applied separately for different situations or combined and
applied together for one specific situation.</p>
<p>In contemporary society, wise reflection is often referred to as the
scientific method. One can also refer to the scientific method as
‘analysis for solving problems’, which corresponds here with reflection
in accord with the Four Noble Truths. Let us compare these two methods
of reflection:</p>
<p>The Scientific Method has five stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Location of Problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting up of an Hypothesis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experimentation and Gathering of Data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis of Data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conclusion</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This method includes the important function of investigating causes,
which is intrinsic to the second stage. The hypothesis may be directly
based on the conjecture of a specific cause, or a cause provides clear
evidence for establishing an hypothesis. There are times, however, when
the evidence does not clearly point to one distinct hypothesis, and
therefore one must form many provisional hypotheses.</p>
<p>In the method of reflecting on and investigating the Four Noble Truths,
the search for causes is designated as a separate stage. Moreover, the
four truths are classified into two separate groups, as follows:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Natural processes (in line with nature): these stages are to be
reached by knowledge – by reflecting on and knowing things according to
the truth, which exists independently.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> The stage of recognizing suffering (<em>dukkha</em>): to know the nature of
suffering or the nature of one’s problems; to know where suffering
manifests and to know its extent or range = the location of
problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The stage of investigating causes (<em>samudaya</em>): to discern the
causes of suffering or of one’s problems = (this stage is not
distinguished in the scientific method).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The stage of drawing an inference to cessation (<em>nirodha</em>): to
examine the potentiality of cessation and the manner by which
problems may be truly solved = setting up of an hypothesis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Methodology (of human beings): this stage needs to be practised
and applied:</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Following the Path (<em>magga</em>): this stage can be subdivided into
three sub-stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Path #1:</em> <em>Esanā</em> (or <em>gavesanā</em>, and including <em>vīmaṁsanā</em>):
seeking verification; experimentation = experimentation and
gathering of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Path #2:</em> <em>Vimaṁsā</em> (or <em>pavicāra</em>): inspection; separation;
selecting those factors that are correct and valid = analysis of
data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Path #3:</em> <em>Anubodha</em>: ‘awakening’; isolating those factors
that are incorrect; apprehending or choosing the true path,
which leads to the solution to one’s problems = conclusion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here are these four stages in greater detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Recognition of Suffering: human beings experience myriad kinds of
suffering, affliction, and difficulty, both physical and mental,
both internal and external. A basic form of suffering, however,
refers to those things that are oppressive because they thwart,
oppose, and conflict with people’s desires and cherished ideas.</p>
<p>Human problems or suffering comes in many different forms, according
to various locations and time periods, and thus one must apply those
solutions appropriate and specific to these conditions. The basic
form of suffering referred to above, however, is inherently
connected to human life and to human nature, regardless of whether
one lives alone or with others. This suffering follows people
constantly; it manifests and issues effects irrespective of whether
people have solved those problems owing to specific times and
places. Addressing this basic form of suffering is a regular and
constant responsibility for people. The degree by which one
rectifies this basic suffering will have an effect on every other
kind of suffering or difficulty – both their level of intensity and
one’s ability to deal with them. Addressing this basic suffering is
thus the most fundamental and supreme benefit for human life. Other
suffering and difficulties must be dealt with at another stage, as
suits the circumstances. {686}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigation of Causes (in order to envision the solution to
problems): this stage of investigation is directly linked to the
third stage of inferring cessation, i.e. the way in which one draws
an inference to cessation depends on how accurately one apprehends
the causes to one’s problems.</p>
<p>Methods (A), (B) &amp; (C) – see stage #3 below: here, one grasps the
cause of suffering incorrectly, say by believing that one is
experiencing inadequate amounts of pleasure; alternatively, one
neglects to investigate causes altogether.</p>
<p>Method (D): here, one understands that the cause of suffering is
craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), or else one gains an even deeper insight into
Dependent Origination (<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>), tracing the cause back
to ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drawing an Inference to Cessation: one reckons that suffering ends
by one of the following processes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By seeking sensual pleasure and indulging oneself to the
maximum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By developing concentrative attainments (<em>jhāna-samāpatti</em>),
according to the ‘way of the yogis’ (<em>yoga-vidhi</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By developing extreme austerities and through
self-mortification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By severing the cycle of Dependent Origination, dispelling
ignorance, cutting off craving, being mindful, and conducting
one’s life with wisdom.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following the Path:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Path #1:</em> <em>esanā</em> (’searching’; ‘experimentation’): the Buddha
practised and experimented with all four of the above methods of
seeking the end of suffering. He also observed how people and
societies live and exist when following each of these four
methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Path #2:</em> <em>vīmaṁsā</em> (’inspection’; ‘analysis’): to analyze
one’s observations and experimentation. The Buddha recognized
(even before his great renunciation) that seeking sensual
pleasures does not give true meaning to life or lead to what is
essential; moreover, it leads to affliction. He saw that yogic
practices lead only so far as various concentrative attainments,
and that severe austerities create torment and affliction in
vain. The path of wisdom, entailing the end of ignorance and
craving, however, is able to eradicate the root of suffering and
leads to true deliverance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Path #3:</em> <em>anubodha</em> (’awakening’; ‘understanding’): one
realizes that the way of sensuality and the way of severe
asceticism are extremes (<em>anta</em>), while the way of the yogis
results in getting stuck in the middle – by this latter way one
does not yet reach the ‘Path’ (<em>magga</em>). The correct and true
course is the Middle Way, the Noble Eightfold Path, the way of
wisdom – which begins with right view.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In Thailand, Dr. Saroj Buasri has already written about the comparison
between the scientific method and the method in accord with the Four
Noble Truths, for example in his book ‘<em>A Philosophy of Education for
Thailand: the Confluence of Buddhism and Democracy</em>’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn91">91</a></sup> This is
praiseworthy work. However, because in the meantime there has been
further examination and contemplation on this subject, I have introduced
some different ideas.</p>
<p>I mentioned in an earlier chapter how the natural law of the three
characteristics (<em>tilakkhaṇa</em>) and the law of Dependent Origination are
in fact the same law, but described from different angles. Impermanence
and inconstancy produce pressure and conflict, and thus it is natural
for there to be fluctuation (<em>aniccaṃ dukkhaṃ vipariṇāma-dhammaṃ</em>). Yet
this process occurs according to causes and conditions. Reflecting in
this way expands the study of wise reflection to include the method of
dialectics (<em>vibhāsā-vidhi</em>). It would be useful, however, to try and
interpret the method of dialectics by applying the mode of detailed
analysis (<em>vibhajja-vidhi</em>). This matter can be reviewed and considered
by scholars when there is an opportunity.</p>

<p>The following passages containing the terms <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>
and <em>ayoniso-manasikāra</em> may clarify the meanings of these terms:
when quarrels erupt in the community, a person who uses wise
reflection ceases to quarrel and seeks a way to bring the
contentious issues to a close (VinA. V. 1151; MA. IV. 205; JA. III.
489; DhA. I. 65); vengeance can be quelled by way of wise reflection
(DhA. I. 51); grasping the meaning of sutta passages with unwise
reflection leads to misunderstanding – for instance, by
encountering the word <em>sambhavesī</em> (’a being subject to rebirth’)
one may wrongly conclude that the Buddha affirmed an intermediate
state of existence (<em>antarābhava</em>) – see: UdA. 93; wise reflection
helps a trainable person to realize the Dhamma (SA. III. 6); wise
reflection helps a person to benefit from listening to the Dhamma
(ItA. II. 25; NdA. I. 8 – based on A. III. 174-5); the term
<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em> refers to ‘insight’ (<em>vipassanā</em>) and is used as
a substitute for the phrase ‘developing insight’ (in many passages,

generally used as ‘in the meaning of’ or ‘in the sense of’, for
example: ‘It is called right concentration in the sense of
“non-distraction” ‘ (Ps. I. 21; similar to Ps. II. 96); ‘It is
called concentration in the sense of “well-established” ‘ (Vism.
84-5). In the original Pali texts, however, this term is used to

previous quotation, on the gratification in, danger in, and escape
from the world. There are several other passages by the Buddha
similar to this one, on the following subjects: the four elements

external sense objects (S. IV. 6-12); and the five spiritual

<p>Cf.: D. III. 130. Of these reflections on the four requisites,
the most commonly mentioned one is the reflection on eating; a
person who practises this is called ‘one who knows moderation in
eating’ (<em>bhojane-mattaññutā</em>): e.g.: M. I. 273; M. III. 2-3; S. IV.
104, 176-7; A. II. 39-40; A. IV. 167-8. Moderation in eating is a
way to reduce craving for flavours (<em>rasa-taṇhā</em>): Nd. I. 240-41.
Note that the term <em>yoniso paṭisaṅkhā</em> is used here for ‘reflecting
wisely’, but the meaning of this term lies within the scope of the
term <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>, according to the principle expressed at
M. I. 7. These two terms are clearly used interchangeably at: M. I.
11 &amp; S. V. 79. The Sabbāsavasaṁvara Sutta provides a good example
for showing the range of meaning of the term <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>
(M. I. 6-12); a similar sutta exists at A. III. 387-8.</p>

<p>Trans.: Bhikkhu Bodhi explains this passage: ‘Use of stored-up
food is prohibited by Pācittiya 38. Regarding “giving a gross hint”,
Mp says: “Here, digging the ground and ordering, ‘Dig!’ is called
giving a gross hint in regard to the ground. Cutting and ordering
‘Cut!’ is called giving a gross hint with regard to vegetation.” The
reference is to Pācittiyas 10 and 11.’ <em>The Numerical Discourses of

<p>The Saṅgīti Sutta in the Tipiṭaka resulted from the Buddha
referring both to the past (i.e. to the breaking up into factions of
the Nigaṇṭhā after the death of their teacher) and to the future
(i.e. to compose the Dhammavinaya to prevent the future monastic
sangha from breaking up into factions). A useful summary of these
principles is the Buddha’s definition for mindfulness (<em>sati</em>): ‘An
ability to recollect actions performed and words spoken, even those
from long ago’ (e.g.: D. III. 268; Vbh. 227).</p>

<p>Note that the threefold training (<em>sikkhā</em>) is a system of
training. Compared to the Noble Eightfold Path, the threefold
training pertains primarily to an engagement with one’s external
environment. Having practised the threefold training, the skills
that one hones become internal virtuous qualities, comprising the
essence or content of the Eightfold Path. The <em>sīla</em> factors of the
Path, for example, are personal qualities preventing a person from
immoral or abusive physical and verbal actions. These virtues or
character traits arise from effective training.</p>

<p>Cf.: Vism. 243. To avoid confusion, note that some forms of
meditation which have one see people or things as unattractive,
repulsive or impure are classified as the stage of tranquillity
meditation (<em>samatha</em>). Here, one still sees things according to
conventions and designations, but simply selects those conventional
labels that help to dispel one’s defilements. In insight meditation,
on the other hand, one sees things as they truly are, as they really
exist, according to causes and conditions. At this level things are
neither ‘beautiful’ nor ‘ugly’, neither ‘attractive’ nor
‘repulsive’.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#the-role-of-reflection-in-a-wholesome-way-of-life" id="the-role-of-reflection-in-a-wholesome-way-of-life">The Role of Reflection in a Wholesome Way of Life</a></h2>
<p>Buddhist spiritual practice may be defined as the way in which laws of
nature benefit human beings, or as the application of one’s knowledge of
such laws in order to benefit humanity. Correct or excellent spiritual
conduct thus refers to living one’s life in a way that optimizes how
natural causal dynamics benefit oneself and others. One conducts one’s
life with insight into nature, acting to induce causes and conditions
that generate favourable results for all people. This emphasis is
particularly evident in the teachings on volitional actions
(<em>karma</em>/<em>kamma</em>).</p>
<p>Technically speaking, one practises the Middle Way
<em>(majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>): one applies the Middle Teaching
(<em>majjhena-dhammadesanā</em>; the impartial teaching of truth) to benefit
humanity and to reach the final goal of the Buddha’s teachings.</p>
<p>Virtuous conduct (<em>cariya</em>) can thus be divided into three stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, to know the truth of nature, to have insight into nature,
that all things exist according to causes and conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, to use this knowledge beneficially, to conduct oneself in
harmony with the laws of nature and to act in way that generates
favourable results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, when one acts in accord with causes and conditions, one
allows them to generate results automatically and independently –
one observes them with understanding, without grasping onto them and
affixing a sense of self.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowledge is thus the mainstay of virtuous conduct; it is a vital factor
from beginning to end. Virtuous conduct is equivalent to living with
wisdom, and a virtuous person is thus referred to as a <em>paṇḍita</em> – a
wise person.</p>
<p>Because wisdom is required from the start, the Buddhist system of
spiritual conduct (the Path – <em>magga</em>; the Middle Way) begins with
right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>; right understanding). {688}</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#importance-of-right-view" id="importance-of-right-view">Importance of Right View</a></h3>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, just as the dawn’s light is the harbinger and precursor of the
rising of the sun, so too, right view is the forerunner and precursor
of awakening to the Four Noble Truths as they really are. It is to be
expected that a monk with right view will understand as it really is:
‘This is suffering ... this is the cause of suffering ... this is the
cessation of suffering ... this is the way leading to the cessation of
suffering.’</p>
<p><em>S. V. 442.</em></p>
<p>Monks, of all the Path factors, right view comes first. And how does
right view come first? [With right view] one understands wrong view
as wrong view and right view as right view ... one understands wrong
thought as wrong thought and right thought as right thought ... one
understands wrong speech ... right speech ... wrong action ... right
action ... wrong livelihood ... right livelihood as right livelihood.</p>
<p><em>M. III. 71-77.</em></p>
<p>And how is right view the leader? When one possesses right view, right
thought comes into being; when one possesses right thought, right
speech comes into being; when one possesses right speech, right action
comes into being; when one possesses right action, right livelihood
comes into being; when one possesses right livelihood, right effort
comes into being; when one possesses right effort, right mindfulness
comes into being; when one possesses right mindfulness, right
concentration comes into being; when one possesses right
concentration, right knowledge comes into being; when one possesses
right knowledge, right deliverance comes into being. Thus the trainee
who possesses eight factors becomes an arahant who possesses ten
factors.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. III. 76.</em></p>
<p>That a monk with rightly grounded view, with a rightly grounded
development of the Path, could pierce ignorance, arouse true
knowledge, and realize Nibbāna: this is possible. For what reason?
Because his view is rightly grounded.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 10-11, 49.</em></p>
<p>I see no other thing which is so conducive for the arising of
non-arisen wholesome qualities, or for the increase and prosperity of
arisen wholesome qualities, as right view. {689}</p>
<p><em>A. I. 30-31.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3><a class="header" href="#definitions-of-right-view" id="definitions-of-right-view">Definitions of Right View</a></h3>
<p>The most common definition for right view is a knowledge of the Four
Noble Truths:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And what, monks, is right view? Knowledge of suffering, knowledge of
the origin of suffering, knowledge of the cessation of suffering,
knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering: this is
called right view.</p>
<p><em>E.g.: D. II. 311-12; M. I. 48-9, 62; S. V. 8-9; Vbh. 104, 235.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Other definitions include:</p>
<p>To know both wholesome and unwholesome qualities, along with their root
causes:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>When a noble disciple understands the unwholesome and the root of the
unwholesome, the wholesome and the root of the wholesome, in that way
he is one of right view, whose view is straight, who has unwavering
confidence in the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. I. 46-7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>To discern the three characteristics:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A monk discerns as impermanent physical form ... feeling ...
perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness which is
actually impermanent: this discernment of his is right view. Seeing
rightly, he experiences disenchantment. With the end of delight comes
the end of lust; with the end of lust comes the end of delight. With
the end of delight and lust the heart is liberated and is said to be
thoroughly liberated.</p>
<p><em>S. III. 51.</em></p>
<p>A monk discerns as impermanent the eye ... ear ... nose ... tongue ...
body ... mind ... physical form ... sounds ... smells ... tastes ...
tactile objects ... mental objects which are actually impermanent:
this discernment of his is right view.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 142.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>To discern Dependent Origination (for examples, see Chapter 4).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The Buddha also defined two levels of right view: right view ‘connected
to the taints’ (<em>sāsava</em>) and transcendent right view:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And what, monks, is right view? Right view, I say, is twofold: there
is right view that is affected by taints, classified as meritorious,
bearing fruit in respect to the five aggregates; and there is right
view that is noble, taintless, transcendent, a factor of the Path.</p>
<p>And what is right view that is affected by the taints, classified as
meritorious, and bearing fruit in respect to the five aggregates?
‘Gifts bear fruit, offerings bear fruit, acts of worship bear fruit;
there is fruit and result of good and bad actions; there is this world
and the other world; there is mother and father; there are beings who
are reborn spontaneously; there are ascetics and brahmans faring and
practising rightly who having realized this world and the other world
for themselves by direct knowledge make them known to others. This is
right view affected by the taints, classified as meritorious, and
bearing fruit in respect to the five aggregates.</p>
<p>And what is right view that is noble, taintless, transcendent, a
factor of the Path? Wisdom, the faculty of wisdom, the power of
wisdom, the investigation-of-Dhamma enlightenment factor, the Path
factor of right view in one whose mind is noble, whose mind is
taintless, who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble
path: this is right view that is noble, taintless, transcendent, a
factor of the Path. {690}</p>
<p><em>M. III. 72.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3><a class="header" href="#general-points" id="general-points">General Points</a></h3>
<p><em>Ditthi</em> is most often translated as ‘view’, but its meaning also
includes ‘belief’, ‘ideology’, ‘opinion’, ‘rational knowledge’, ‘things
conforming with personal understanding’, ‘principles deemed acceptable’,
‘agreeable notions’, ‘cherished opinions’, ‘preferences’, and ‘personal
values’. The meaning of this term also includes a person’s ideals,
worldview, outlook on life, and basic attitudes which result from such
views, knowledge, and preferences.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>As mentioned above, there are two levels or kinds of view: first, views
and understanding connected to a sense of value, say of what is good and
bad, appropriate and inappropriate; and second, views and understanding
about the truth, say of what something is, how it exists, and from where
it originates.</p>
<p>Views, personal understanding, and cherished beliefs exercise great
influence and control over how people live their lives and over society
as a whole. In the teaching on the ten courses of action
(<em>kamma-patha</em>), <em>diṭṭhi</em> is classified as mental kamma, which has more
serious consequences than either physical kamma or verbal kamma.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>
This is because mental kamma is the underlying cause for physical and
verbal actions. Views are able to lead individuals, society, or the
whole human race to either prosperity and freedom or to decline and
ruin.</p>
<p>This is apparent in the lives of individual people: views determine how
one lives, both in terms of processing information and of outward
expression: to how one looks at the world and to how one acts in
relation to the world. This begins with how one interprets, evaluates,
and judges new experiences. Views determine what things, or aspects of
things, one seeks out and selects, and what things one favours or
disfavours. They then influence the course of one’s thoughts, speech and
actions, the way one responds, reacts, and deals with things: how one
speaks or behaves towards another person, an object, a surrounding, or a
situation, along with how one creates justifications for such speech and
action.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, views determine other mental factors, beginning
with one’s thoughts (<em>saṅkappa</em>), making them either ‘right’ (<em>sammā</em>)
or ‘wrong’ (<em>micchā</em>), accordingly.</p>
<p>The importance of views in spiritual practice is obvious. For example,
if someone likes money, and sees material wealth as life’s goal, as the
yardstick for success and as the sign of self-importance, he will strive
to gain such wealth. Both this person’s education and work will be
undertaken for this purpose, and he will measure, appraise, and honour
others by using wealth as the criteria. If such a person is morally
deficient, he will seek wealth indiscriminately, without considering if
his actions are righteous, and he will look upon those poor people who
are morally virtuous as foolish, old-fashioned, or worthless.</p>
<p>If a child believes that having power is good he will incline towards
asserting power, enjoying domineering and bullying others. {691}</p>
<p>If a person does not believe in merit (<em>puñña</em>) and evil (<em>pāpa</em>), and
views these terms as empty threats, he will pay no attention to
teachings on wholesome behaviour or refrain from things considered
unskilful.</p>
<p>When one lacks a deep understanding of life and of the world, as being
ultimately unstable and fleeting, one tends to cling to the body, to
life, to possessions, and to people. One is generally anxious and
frightened, and one gives expression to the suffering resulting from
one’s attachment and fear.</p>
<p>With all of these examples, the opposite is also true: wholesome views
lead to a wholesome outcome.</p>
<p>Right view is called <em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>, and wrong view is called
<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>. The conditions for wrong view are a harmful influence
by other people, a bad social environment, especially evil friends, and
a lack of wise reflection (<em>ayoniso-manasikāra</em>): an inability to
contemplate or a tendency to think in incorrect ways.</p>
<p>The conditions for right view are a beneficial influence by other people
– to be correctly moulded and instructed by a favourable social
environment, especially through contact with virtuous friends and by
associating with honest people – and wise reflection.</p>
<p>The main focus of this chapter is right view, with occasional references
to wrong view.</p>
<p>Right view is divided into two kinds or two levels:</p>
<p><strong>Mundane right view (<em>lokiya-sammādiṭṭhi</em>):</strong> views connected to and
dependent on the world; views, beliefs, and understanding about the
world that correspond to principles of goodness, accord with the way of
righteousness, or are in harmony with virtuous behaviour, as described
in the sutta passages above.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this kind of right view is a result of external
teachings (<em>paratoghosa</em>) or of social factors, and it relies on faith
as a link or as a guiding force.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> In particular it results from the
instruction one receives from society, say through teachings and
training in ethics and by cultural transmission. It is related to wise
reflection; the kind of wise reflection applied here generally
encourages a person to engage in wholesome activities.</p>
<p>This kind of right view is associated with evaluation: what is good,
bad, right, wrong, better, worse, what should and shouldn’t be. And it
also encompasses belief systems and teachings which preserve these
values of goodness.</p>
<p>Because this kind of right view stems from social conditioning and
external transmission, it manifests as teachings, rules, standards, and
beliefs established or prescribed by human beings. As such, these views
are superimposed on, or they are one step removed from, the laws of
nature. They are therefore ‘mundane’: their details and particulars vary
according to time and place, and change subject to surrounding social
developments.</p>
<p>Personal likes, preferences, and values are included in this
classification of mundane views.</p>
<p>Although the details of this kind of view change according to different
places and time periods, there is a general principle for determining
what is right view, namely, the principle or law of kamma. This is
because the law of kamma is a truth or a law of nature that confirms or
validates the entirety of human behaviour. {692}</p>
<p>Mundane right view is confirmed by this law of nature and it is in
harmony with this natural truth. For this reason, mundane right view is
occasionally defined as <em>kammassakatā-ñāṇa</em>: the knowledge that people
are the owners of their kamma, that they must be held accountable for
their actions, and that they receive the fruits of their actions.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>
This knowledge is in accord with the law of kamma. In other words, it is
the knowledge that all human behaviour and the results of such behaviour
proceed according to the law of interrelated causes and conditions.</p>
<p>Mundane right view reflects the basic values of people, e.g.: a sense of
responsibility for one’s actions; the wish for results from one’s
actions, efforts, capabilities, and intelligence; the ability for
self-reliance; and the endeavour for mutual assistance.</p>
<p>Note that knowledge of the law of kamma here is simply a basic
understanding of how each individual is the owner of his or her
intentional actions and must take responsibility for them. This
knowledge accords with the law of kamma, but it is not yet a direct
understanding of this law or a direct insight into the law of causality.
This deeper knowledge or insight is classified as transcendent right
view, which will be discussed below.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are other ways to measure mundane right view, for
example: views which support and are conducive to a happy life and a
thriving society; or views which help a person advance on the Path and
engenders other Path factors, beginning with right thought.</p>
<p>Because mundane right view corresponds with truth, it can link up with
and lead to transcendent right view.</p>
<p><strong>Transcendent right view (<em>lokuttara-sammādiṭṭhi</em>):</strong> knowledge and
understanding about life and about the world which accords with truth;
an understanding of the nature of reality; an understanding of nature.</p>
<p>This kind of right view results from wise reflection, which is an
internal factor. Beneficial teachings by other people or having virtuous
friends can help only to the extent of encouraging people to apply wise
reflection and to see for themselves. This kind of right view cannot
arise by simply listening to others and believing them by way of faith.
It requires investigating nature and understanding phenomena directly.</p>
<p>Therefore, transcendent right view is independent of teachings, rules,
and beliefs created by people additional to and separate from the laws
of nature. It is free from social influence and not subject to varying
external factors. It is a true connection with nature, whose
characteristics remain the same in every place and era. This kind of
right view is ‘transcendent’: it is timeless, not restricted to a
specific time era; it remains the same knowledge required for
comprehensive wisdom and liberation in every time and place.</p>
<p>This second kind of right view, transcendent right view, refers
specifically to clear knowledge relating to the stage of path and fruit,
resulting in awakening. {693}</p>
<p>Having said this, right view connected to path and fruit is a
consequence of the same kind of right view belonging to unawakened
beings. Therefore, I suggest defining the right view in this second
classification that still belongs to unawakened beings as ‘right view
conforming to transcendence’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>The fruits of transcendent right view (or even right view conforming to
transcendence) are much more profound than those of mundane right view,
and they are able to utterly transform a person’s personality,
completely uprooting negative qualities in the mind.</p>
<p>Only this level of right view is able to eradicate the defilements (not
merely suppress them), and is able to create true stability in regard to
virtue. One is not swayed by the values and perceptions instilled by
society because one has penetrated through the level of conventional
truth and seen the underlying reality.</p>
<p>This subject has an important bearing on spiritual development: here,
one needs to consider the proper relationship to both human society and
to nature, to recognize how to properly benefit from these two sources.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, right view conforming to transcendence stems from
wise reflection, which plays an essential role. Generally speaking, the
behaviour of unawakened persons is dictated by values instilled by
society, for example to abstain from specific kinds of bad deeds and to
perform specific kinds of good deeds, according to model teachings,
instructions, transmissions, edicts, etc. Whenever unawakened persons
are not governed by such socially instilled values, they are prone to
falling subject to craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), which in today’s parlance may be
referred to as ‘negative emotions’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> Wise reflection helps to free
people from the influence of social values and from the enslavement by
mental defilement; it engenders a freedom of behaviour guided by wisdom.</p>
<p>In sum, at initial stages of spiritual practice, when one thinks or acts
without the presence of wise reflection, one either succumbs to external
social values or one falls under the power of one’s own craving. When
one possesses transcendent right view, however, one is truly liberated
from the influence and power of society, and from personal craving.</p>
<p>Whenever ‘view’ (<em>diṭṭhi</em>) becomes right view, it is equivalent or
synonymous to wisdom,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> even though at beginning stages right view is
still just an opinion or a belief. This is because the opinion or belief
corresponds with truth and is based on an understanding of reality, and
begins to escape from the clutches of ignorance and craving.</p>
<p>Even though the views and beliefs later transform into clear knowledge
(<em>ñāṇa</em>), this knowledge is still referred to as ‘right view’ in order
to acknowledge a progressive and connected development of discernment.</p>
<p>The term ‘right view’ thus has a broad meaning, encompassing correct
views and opinions as well as a direct knowledge of the truth. {694}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#right-view-in-the-context-of-spiritual-study" id="right-view-in-the-context-of-spiritual-study">Right View in the Context of Spiritual Study</a></h3>
<p>Some beginning spiritual practitioners who possess a degree of right
view may believe that in keeping with the threefold training the
starting point of spiritual practice is moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>), i.e.
that spiritual development begins with good behaviour (<em>sucarita</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup>
This claim, however, misses the core of spiritual practice. The real
purpose of spiritual practice at the level of morality – of forming a
wholesome disposition and creating wholesome habits – is to enable
people who are responsive to training (<em>veneyya</em>) to recognize the true
value of moral conduct.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Only when one develops a deep understanding of moral conduct, i.e. one
develops right view, will one’s virtuous conduct be secure.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup> At this
stage one’s spiritual practice has truly begun. In other words, the
reason why the threefold training begins with moral conduct is in order
to nurture the Path factors, starting with right view. When the Path
factors, led by right view, arise in a person, he or she is said to have
begun spiritual training.</p>
<p>From this point on the Path factors begin to perform their specific
functions and to act in a coordinated way. Besides securing moral
conduct, right view leads to sincerity and honesty, and it guarantees
that one’s behaviour accords with the heart and objective of moral
principles. One’s conduct does not err into an adherence to rules and
practices (<em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>) or into gullibility. When one possesses
right view one can trust in one’s virtuous conduct, but if one lacks
right view such self-confidence is absent.</p>
<p>From another angle, by focusing on the conditions for right view, one
can say that spiritual practice begins with an ability to reflect wisely
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>). This is true because when there is wise
reflection right view naturally follows. Even on the level of moral
conduct, when wise reflection helps to guide behaviour, one’s actions
will be correct and performed for useful ends. In addition, one gains
understanding, confidence, and joy.</p>
<p>Take for example the act of dressing oneself properly: besides
considering the value of covering oneself modestly and protecting
oneself from the elements, wise reflection also assists in considering
the benefits to others and to society. One thinks: ‘I will dress in a
clean and tidy way for the wellbeing of the community or of society. I
won’t dress in a distasteful or offensive way. I will dress in a
dignified and pleasing way to support wholesome mind states in those
whom I meet, to make them feel at ease.’</p>
<p>On the contrary, if one thinks of boasting about one’s elegance or
social status, of showing off, of intimidating, seducing, or tricking
others, this reveals a lack of wise reflection. The mind will then be
dominated by unwholesome qualities; it will be constricted and unhappy,
and the act of wearing clothes will be immodest and misguided. {695}</p>
<p>When people hear the word ‘study’ they usually think of the learning
required for a specific profession and for earning a livelihood, which
in Buddhist practice is a matter of moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>).</p>
<p>Naturally, no righteous person would approve of a career education that
gives no consideration to whether one’s livelihood is right or wrong.
But an education that aims only at establishing right livelihood,
without focusing on establishing right view, is still not correct, and
it is unlikely to fulfil one’s wishes, even to the extent of creating
right livelihood, because it has not reached the heart of spiritual
study. It may lead to right livelihood in name only, not true right
livelihood, because it involves a training in moral conduct that does
not generate the Path factors. It is still superficial and perfunctory;
it is not rooted in the Eightfold Path.</p>
<p>The correct way is to establish right view as a foundation for right
livelihood. It is inadequate to keep moral precepts without having a
love for morality, or to perform good deeds without seeing the true
importance of virtue.</p>
<p>Think of the seemingly implausible things that happen in societies in
which there is widespread immoral conduct. Many people in such societies
see any action that leads to success or wealth, despite it involving
dishonesty, deception, and injury to others, as a sign of cleverness and
skill. Although there is often material abundance in such societies,
there is also much evildoing and crime. In contrast, there are other
societies which are relatively impoverished but in which there is little
crime. Some of the poor people in such societies would rather beg for
food than commit theft or other bad deeds (whereas beggars in dishonest
societies may act unscrupulously even while begging).</p>
<p>In the context of formal teaching this subject matter reveals the
important relationship between the Eightfold Path and the threefold
training, which is evident with these two factors – right view and
moral training – the first factors in these two teachings,
respectively.</p>
<p>In terms of the interrelationship between moral conduct and right view,
when people live together peacefully and in a well-disciplined fashion,
there is an absence of fear and distrust. When one acts virtuously the
mind is untroubled, calm, and concentrated. When the mind is calm and
bright, one’s thinking is nimble; one discerns things clearly and
without bias, giving rise to understanding and wisdom. Wisdom’s ability
to discern the value of moral conduct is an expression of right view.
With right view and right understanding, a person’s thoughts, speech,
and actions are naturally virtuous.</p>
<p>And as mentioned above, training in moral conduct is truly an aspect of
spiritual practice only when it gives rise to right view, at least when
one gains a deep appreciation for moral conduct and one sees its value.
There are two ways of training in moral conduct that bear fruit as right
view:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Training in moral conduct relying on routine behaviour and faith:
this way emphasizes a code of discipline, of setting up a framework
to regulate behaviour and of establishing a specific system, say of
a daily routine, in order to create good habits and a wholesome
disposition. In addition, one develops faith by having virtuous
friends or teachers point out the benefits and blessings of doing
good and of following a moral code. Virtuous friends may also
introduce one to honourable, successful, and happy persons (this may
be the friends and teachers themselves) to act as a model for
behaviour. {696}</p>
<p>In this way, a deep appreciation of goodness, a love of moral
discipline, and an enthusiasm for virtuous conduct is generated.
Even if one does not have a teacher to point out the benefits of
doing good or to act as an example, if one is able to adhere to such
a moral code, having it influence one’s habits and disposition, and
one sees the benefits of virtue, one will develop an interest in
morality and apply reasoning in such a way that accords with
virtuous behaviour.</p>
<p>When one goes beyond simply adhering to a moral code or to moral
constraints and one sees the value of virtuous conduct, one reaches
the stage of right view and one’s spiritual practice truly begins.
This is true despite the fact that one’s right view may still be
weak and unstable, and one’s practice may contain a degree of
attachment, naivety, and an adherence to rules and practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training in moral conduct using wise reflection: this way emphasizes
a thorough understanding of the objectives for actions and for
practice; one practises with wise reflection, or one applies wise
reflection to guide and direct behaviour, as described in the
example of wearing clothes above.</p>
<p>Here, a teacher helps by first pointing out a way of contemplating
and understanding the purpose of specific actions. When it comes to
practical application, however, the students or practitioners must
use wise reflection in each instance themselves.</p>
<p>Take as another example the act of paying respects to a monk or to
an elder. The person paying respects may reflect on the wholesome
and appropriate reasons for such an action, considering for example:
‘I pay respects in order to train myself to be humble and
cooperative’; ‘I pay respects in order to honour good manners and
for the wellbeing of the community’; ‘I pay respects as a sign of
reverence for the Dhamma, which is embodied in this person’; ‘I pay
respects to this person with thoughts of kindness and benevolence,
to help remind him to preserve virtuous and suitable qualities’; or
‘I pay respects in order to practise the Dhamma in the most
beautiful and correct fashion.’</p>
<p>On the part of the monks, the elders, or the teachers, who are the
recipients of such gestures of respect, they may reflect: ‘This is
an occasion to take stock whether I possess such virtuous qualities
making me worthy of such respect’; ‘I am in a position to offer
advice and teachings to this person; is he acting in a suitable
way?’; ‘I rejoice in this highly virtuous person’s conduct; she
loves the harmony of the community and venerates the Dhamma’; ‘I
will follow these worldly conventions; I will do whatever is of
benefit to the world.’</p>
<p>When one reflects wisely in such ways one gains confidence in one’s
actions, and unwholesome qualities cease to dominate the mind. Those
paying respects, for example, do not compare themselves to another
through an impure attachment to self-identity, for instance by
thinking: ‘What does he possess to make him worthy of respect? I am
better than him – why pay respects?’ And the recipients of
veneration need not become mistrustful, offended, or resentful, say
by thinking: ‘Why does this person not show respect to me? Why does
he not show respect in an agreeable way?’ They do not get carried
away by thinking: ‘People come to bow and pay respects to me – I am
so special and excellent.’ {697}</p>
<p>The examples here describe a wise reflection that induces wholesome
qualities and gives rise to mundane right view. We can see, however,
that this second way of training is more profound than the first
way, as it is able to prevent the damage of unwholesome qualities
taking hold of the mind. The first way of training in moral conduct
is unable to provide this prevention. The second way possesses the
confidence of wisdom. It gradually increases the understanding of
right view while training in moral conduct, and it defends against a
naive and gullible moral conduct that is referred to as an
‘adherence to rules and practices’ (<em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the outline of the Eightfold Path, the second way of
training in moral conduct is the most correct. Linking this training
with the first way described above is likely to lead to even better
results, but solely applying the first way is considered inadequate for
true spiritual practice. This is because in correct practice, in
relation to one’s surroundings, one begins with training in moral
conduct, but in relation to the mind, one must from the very start
reflect on things in order to cultivate wisdom and develop right view.
Doing this one incorporates wise reflection, which can be applied at all
times in one’s life.</p>
<p>One does not hold back and only apply systematic reflection in times of
formal contemplation or only apply it to the context of moral conduct –
such reflection is equally important when developing concentration and
wisdom. Right view and the other Path factors thus become increasingly
proficient and complete.</p>
<p>Here, one sees the development of the Path factors that is linked to the
practice of the threefold training. From an external perspective or by
considering the major stages of practice, one sees the gradual
development according to the threefold training, of moral conduct
(<em>sīla</em>), concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). But when one
looks more closely at the details of a person’s spiritual efforts, one
sees that the Path factors are busily engaged. The person continually
walks along the Path.</p>
<p>In sum, for practice to be correct, from an external perspective there
is an emphasis on the threefold training, while inwardly a person walks
in line with the Path. This way the external systems of training and the
internal development of spiritual factors are well integrated.</p>
<p>Taking these considerations into account, if one leaves people to
develop spiritually on their own in accord with nature, without relying
on any social factors for assistance, there will only be a few prodigies
who are able to apply wise reflection by themselves and reach the
highest stage of realization.</p>
<p>Conversely, if one leaves people to develop solely by way of social
influence and control, they will be unable to realize the highest good
which is within their potential.</p>
<p>Therefore, the following two ways of spiritual development are
considered extreme and incorrect:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Development left to unfold on its own, naturally and without
interference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development following the control and sway of society.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Spiritual development left up to nature is inadequate; one must also
foster an understanding of natural phenomena which leads to a proper
relationship to nature.</p>
<p>Equally, spiritual development following the dictates of society is also
inadequate; one must also gain a thorough knowledge which allows one to
escape from the influencing power of society.</p>
<p>A complete development involves an interaction with and an understanding
of both nature and society, because people are shaped and influenced
both by natural and social forces. {698} Such development is nourished
by society and by nature, bringing about prosperity and happiness.</p>
<p>If people are to live together in peace – even just two people – there
must be boundaries and means to regulate behaviour. When many people
live together there is a necessity for rules or agreements on behaviour,
of what should be done and what should be avoided, in order to bring
about harmony and safety for each individual. (Even an individual person
has conflicting desires and requires self-discipline in order to live
well.)</p>
<p>Take the example of numerous drivers arriving at a junction from
different directions: each person is in a hurry and vies to pass first.
They thus all get stuck and no one can advance, causing chaos and
disputes. If they are willing to lay down a set of regulations, however,
everyone can pass comfortably. Likewise, a community or society requires
a set of rules.</p>
<p>Apart from rules, there is a collection of inherited social systems,
customs, traditions, cultural practices, institutions, and a body of
technical knowledge, which give shape to a particular society. These
factors shaping society also shape individuals, instilling in them
properties that conform with society. At the same time individuals
influence the society. Individual people and the society as a whole are
thus interdependent.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, when a society has a clearly defined shape and form, it
tends to become rigid and inflexible, resulting in a one-sided exchange
of people being shaped by society in order to meet society’s needs and
expectations.</p>
<p>People, however, do not exist solely to uphold society. Society exists
to benefit individuals and on a fundamental level it was created for the
increased wellbeing of people.</p>
<p>From this perspective, society is only one supportive factor in people’s
lives, and on its own it is unable to lead people to a truly virtuous
life, because social institutions themselves were created simply to
establish a sense of order and discipline. Once people live together in
harmony, there is something besides maintaining social integrity which
it is incumbent on them to realize. Besides social institutions, people
need to pay attention to nature, and the most supreme blessing of life
is obtained through an understanding of nature. This is because the
truth of life is essentially grounded in nature.</p>
<p>Society is simply one supportive factor in people’s lives, which can
either help to foster an increased intimacy and knowledge of nature, or
it can have the opposite effect and cause an alienation from nature. In
any case, even though society may have a clear and strictly defined
shape it is not the only factor influencing people.</p>
<p>If people are able to apply wise reflection, they can escape from the
controlling power of society. Wise reflection enables a person to
transcend or see through society and to realize the underlying timeless
truth of nature. A person endowed with wise reflection is able to be
free from the power of social conditioning, to attain higher levels of
virtue, and to return in order to shape society in a fully attentive
way. {699}</p>
<p>People require a code of conduct in order to live together in harmony.
Society thus needs a moral code as well as a compatible set of rules for
people to follow. It is true that this moral code can simply become a
way to limit people’s freedom or it can even be a way of enslaving
people to a system of control, if it is simply a set of prohibitions and
rules which people observe by blindly following one another. And it can
lead to other ill effects if it is maintained through coercion or
deception.</p>
<p>Similarly, actions which are alleged to be ‘free’ may only be
expressions of a mind subject to defilement and suffering. In this case,
it is simply a freedom to give expression to mental bondage, freedom to
be a slave, or freedom to allow people to be enslaved. This form of
freedom involves disenfranchising others in some way or other, directly
or indirectly.</p>
<p>In contrast, people who are free from the power of mental defilement,
and who are able to apply wisdom without the obscuring power of social
conditioning, do not require prescribed moral standards. They are
endowed with an inherent moral discipline, and, moreover, they are able
to comply with any moral code that they recognize as benefiting other
human beings.</p>
<p>The important link here is that a moral code is a good thing when it is
set down and followed with a correct understanding of its objectives,
that is, moral conduct must be accompanied by right view.</p>
<p>Therefore, when one is teaching children a moral discipline, one must
also engender an understanding of the value and necessity of discipline.</p>
<p>When laying down rules, regulations, precepts, etc., it is important for
participating members to understand their purpose and to give consent,
which will prevent them from feeling coerced or ordered about, or from
simple blind obedience. (See
Note <a href="#note-laying-down-vinaya">Laying down the Vinaya</a>) Even in terms of existing social
systems, customs, traditions, and institutions it is important to teach
each new generation the value of these things.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Laying down the Vinaya</span><a id="note-laying-down-vinaya"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that when laying down the Vinaya rules for the bhikkhu sangha the
Buddha would gather the entire community and explain the purpose of
each rule, obtaining everyone’s acknowledgment and consent. Moreover,
he did not use such terms as ‘command’, ‘forbid’, ‘force’, ‘don’t’, or
‘must’.</p>
<p>In reference to clauses resembling prohibitions he used the phrase: ‘A
monk who acts in such a way commits a transgression of such and such a
degree.’ In reference to unsuitable actions outside of the Pāṭimokkha
at most he would say: ‘You should not do that.’</p>
<p>As for clauses resembling orders or commandments he would use the term
<em>anuññāta</em> (’permitted’, ‘allowed’) or at most would say: ‘You should
do that.’</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In addition, people should be taught to understand natural phenomena, to
discern the world according to truth, which will help them to escape
from the power of social conditioning and to reach higher levels of
spiritual excellence which society is unable to provide.</p>
<p>Most importantly, society should act as a ‘virtuous friend’
(<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>), or at least be a place in which one can discover such
friends, in order to help people train in and develop wise reflection on
the subjects just mentioned.</p>
<p>There is an important difference between nature and society which should
be taught to people from the time they are children. Namely, nature
follows general laws of nature (<em>dhamma-niyāma</em>), whereas human society
follows the additional law of volitional action (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup>
{700}</p>
<p>When teaching children, they should be treated with lovingkindness.
Besides directly showing them kindness in order to foster their
wellbeing, say by making them feel at ease and by promoting longterm
mental health, one should also aim to cultivate their faculty of wisdom,
by leading them to an understanding of wholesome intentions, of
goodwill, and of commitment to other human beings.</p>
<p>This understanding arises by having children draw a comparison between
people and nature. If they have skilled teachers, children will
recognize that people are different from nature. Human beings are
possessed of consciousness and intention; they are able to volitionally
manage and steer their affairs. They are able to deliberately act well
or to act badly. A mother, for instance, does not raise her child simply
by natural instincts; she also possesses the human qualities of love,
well-wishing, and kind deliberation. And if people treat each other
well, this will lead to everyone’s happiness and wellbeing.</p>
<p>This is distinct from nature, which is neutral, does not possess
faculties of mind, and does not think in good or bad ways. Nature is
sometimes gentle and favourable to people, giving them satisfaction and
joy; at other times it is violent and destructive, causing pain and
suffering. Whichever way it goes nature is not wilful – it does not act
out of spite. Nature exists according to its own causes and conditions.
In any case, human beings are dependent on nature. We should thus
cherish nature and relate to it with an understanding of causality.</p>
<p>Moreover, human life is normally subject to a considerable amount of
pain, due to the unintentional oppressive aspects of nature. We who are
endowed with the ability to deliberately choose a course of action
should not increase the level of suffering for others. Instead, we
should use intention in order to assist others, alleviate their
suffering, and show kindness and compassion.</p>
<p>When showing kindness to children one should beware that this kindness
does not become an indulgence of their craving. For if one indulges
their craving, children will not develop an appreciation of people’s
wholesome intention: they will not recognize how these kind actions are
performed deliberately and intentionally. Moreover, they will fail to
understand the contrasting neutrality of nature. Besides failing to
nurture lovingkindness and a sense of personal responsibility, this
indulgence causes further harm to children by allowing unwholesome mind
states to breed, e.g.: selfishness, stubbornness, weakness of mind,
greed, and envy.</p>
<p>The way to avoid such indulgence is to teach children how to know the
distinction between kind and loving actions performed by human beings
and the causal dynamics inherent in nature. This way one avoids mistaken
expressions of lovingkindness, which obstruct or impair children’s
insight into the truth.</p>
<p>When educating children, one needs to possess all four of the ‘divine
abidings’ (<em>brahmavihāra</em>). Besides being firmly grounded in
lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>): one shows compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>) when a child
is suffering; one acknowledges or rejoices (<em>muditā</em>) in the child’s
happiness or when he or she does something good or acts with sound
judgement; and one is equanimous (<em>upekkhā</em>) or looks on with
objectivity when the child is acting responsibly and reasonably, or when
the child needs to be accountable for the results of his or her actions.
{701} This last factor of equanimity, in particular, ensures that
lovingkindness does not hinder wisdom.</p>
<p>Surrounded by natural forces which are sometimes favourable and
sometimes harmful, human life has no true stability. People must
struggle to survive; they must find things to sustain life, and escape
from and remove hostile elements. When one does not truly understand
nature, one attaches and devotes oneself to those things one hopes will
gratify desire; one sees the world as a place for pursuing sense
pleasures, a place to fulfil all one’s desires. One views oneself as
ruling over the world, and one sees others as obstacles or competitors.
This in turn leads to possessiveness, hostility, hatred, contempt,
competition, and oppression between people. Moreover, when one does not
get what one wants or things later change, this can give rise to intense
suffering.</p>
<p>When one receives encouragement by a virtuous friend, someone who helps
to see the value of lovingkindness, one’s relationship towards other
people and towards nature improves. This, however, is still right view
on a mundane level.</p>
<p>If one wishes to develop a truly secure understanding, one must also
cultivate transcendent right view. This is done by understanding the
truth of life and of the world, namely: all things exist according to
causes and conditions; all worldly phenomena (<em>loka-dhamma</em>) are
uncertain and impermanent; they are inherently insubstantial – they are
without an essential ‘core’ which would make them independent from other
phenomena; they cannot be truly controlled; and they cannot give
essential meaning to life.</p>
<p>We human beings are without a ‘self’ which is able to truly control
anything else; our lives are subject to the same laws of nature as other
people; humans and other living creatures are all companions in birth,
old age, sickness, and death – we all cherish happiness and are averse
to suffering; moreover, all life is dependent on other life in order to
exist.</p>
<p>This kind of understanding is fundamental, even for children, in order
to know how to correctly relate to the world and to other people. It
leads people to change how they give value to things, switching from
using craving to using wisdom as the means of evaluation. They recognize
what is truly valuable in life and worthy of aspiration, they know how
to make their minds free and happy, and they become more skilled at
alleviating suffering. This firmly established right view reduces greed,
hatred and delusion, reduces competitiveness and oppression, and reduces
moral problems.</p>
<p>When right view is established, a person advances towards the goal with
the support of several other spiritual factors, as described in this
sutta passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, if it is aided by five factors, right view has liberation of
mind and liberation by wisdom as its fruit and reward. These five
factors are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>; behaviour free from oppression).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning (<em>suta</em>: knowledge gained by listening, study, reading,
etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussion (<em>sākacchā</em>: conversing; debating; exchanging ideas;
verifying one’s knowledge).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calm (<em>samatha</em>: calming the mind; an absence of restlessness and
distraction).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insight (<em>vipassanā</em>: using wisdom in order discern things as they
truly are).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup> {702}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>A. III. 20-21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>To summarize, right view accords with reality: it refers to seeing
things as they truly are. The development of right view requires
continual systematic reflection, which prevents seeing things
superficially or seeing only the end result of natural phenomena.
Systematic reflection helps one inquire closely into things, by
analyzing the various converging factors and the sequence of causes and
conditions within natural processes. It prevents one from being deceived
by things or from becoming a puppet that is propelled, convulsed, and
manipulated by sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile objects, and
popular beliefs, leading to personal and social problems. Instead, one
is mindful and fully aware, free, self-confident, and able to determine
and act with wisdom.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#right-thought-sammā-saṅkappa" id="right-thought-sammā-saṅkappa">Right Thought (sammā-saṅkappa)</a></h2>
<p>The general scriptural definition for the second factor of the Eightfold
Path – right thought – is as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, what is right thought? The thought of renunciation, the thought
of non-ill-will, the thought of non-cruelty: this is called right
thought.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup></p>
<p><em>D. II. 311-12; M. III. 251; Vbh. 104, 235.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Here is a definition which distinguishes between mundane and
transcendent right thought:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, what is right thought? I say there are two kinds of right
thought: there is right thought that is affected by taints, classified
as meritorious, bearing fruit in respect to the five aggregates; and
there is right thought that is noble, taintless, transcendent, a
factor of the Path.</p>
<p>Right thought that is affected by the taints ... is the thought of
renunciation, the thought of non-ill-will, the thought of non-cruelty.</p>
<p>Right thought that is noble, taintless, transcendent, a factor of the
Path is thinking (<em>takka</em>), reasoning (<em>vitakka</em>), intention
(<em>saṅkappa</em>), concentrated thought (<em>appanā</em>), firmly established
thought (<em>byappanā</em>), focused attention, and the prerequisites for
speech (<em>vacī-saṅkhāra</em>) in one whose mind is noble, whose mind is
taintless, who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble
path.</p>
<p><em>M. III. 73; Vbh. 110, 237.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>For the sake of brevity, here I will explain only the definition of
right thought as a mundane factor. According to this definition,
<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em> refers to right intention, or to thoughts that go in a
correct direction. This is in contrast to ‘wrong thinking’
(<em>micchā-saṅkappa</em>) of which there are also three kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thoughts of sensuality (<em>kāma-saṅkappa</em>; <em>kāma-vitakka</em>): thoughts
tied up with sensuality; thoughts that are part of the search for
and preoccupation with gratifying sense objects or with things to
satisfy craving and clinging; selfish thoughts. Such thoughts are
marked by greed or lust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thoughts of ill-will (<em>byāpāda-saṅkappa</em>; <em>byāpāda-vitakka</em>):
thoughts accompanied by anger and aversion, indignation, and
displeasure; to see things in a negative light; to see others as
adversaries; to see external things as the source of irritation.
Such thoughts are marked by hatred in the sense of one being the
victim of impingement (this is the opposite quality to friendliness
– <em>mettā</em>). {703}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thoughts of cruelty (<em>vihiṁsā-saṅkappa</em>; <em>vihiṁsā-vitakka</em>):
thoughts of oppression, harm, injury, abuse, and destruction; the
wish to disturb and violate others; the wish that others experience
suffering and distress. Such thoughts are marked by hatred in the
sense of actively instigating conflict (this quality is opposite to
compassion – <em>karuṇā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Such thoughts and intentions are common among people. This is because
when unawakened persons experience a sense impression, for instance by
seeing a visual form or by hearing a sound, one of two feelings
generally arise: if one likes the object, one is pleased and charmed,
desirous of and attached to it, and defers to it; if one dislikes the
object, one is displeased, annoyed, offended – one is averse to it and
sets oneself in opposition to it. From here various thoughts occur in
line with, or following the momentum of, these likes and dislikes.</p>
<p>For this reason the thoughts of unawakened persons are usually biased;
they are obstructed and influenced by pleasure and displeasure, making
it impossible to see things as they truly are.</p>
<p>Thoughts resulting from pleasure and gratification lead to attachment
and entanglement – a gravitating towards certain objects – and become
thoughts of sensuality (<em>kāma-vitakka</em>). Thoughts resulting from
displeasure and discontent lead to resentment, hostility, and antagonism
– to see certain things in a negative light – and become thoughts of
ill-will (<em>byāpāda-vitakka</em>). When these latter thoughts erupt as
thoughts of oppressing or injuring others, they become thoughts of
cruelty (<em>vihiṁsā-vitakka</em>). All of these wrong thoughts give rise to
incorrect viewpoints and an incorrect course of intention.</p>
<p>Biased thoughts, distorted opinions, and obstructed viewpoints originate
due to an initial lack of systematic reflection. One looks at things
superficially, receiving sense impressions without mindfulness and clear
awareness, and one then allows thoughts to flow according to feelings or
according to reasoning driven by likes and dislikes. One does not
analyze the various factors involved in various phenomena and
investigate the participating causes and conditions, conforming to the
principle of systematic reflection.</p>
<p>Wrong view (<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>), the failure to see things as they truly
are, leads to <em>micchā-saṅkappa</em>: wrong thinking, wrong intention, and a
distorted outlook on things. Conversely, wrong thinking leads to wrong
view. These two factors support and reinforce each other.</p>
<p>To see things as they truly are requires systematic reflection. Thoughts
must be free and independent, without the detrimental influence of
preferences, attachments, and aversions. To enable this one must possess
both right view and right thought, and these two factors must be
mutually supportive, just as in the case of incorrect understanding and
thinking.</p>
<p>Systematic reflection fosters right view. When one discerns things
correctly, right thinking in regard to these things arises naturally,
without bias, attachment or aversion.</p>
<p>When one is able to think objectively,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup> free from likes and
dislikes, one sees things as they are: right view is enhanced. In this
way these two factors continue to support one another. {704}</p>
<p>Right thinking (<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>) – the opposite of wrong thinking –
refers to the state of mind in which there is independent thought and
analytic reflection, free from bias, either as attachment or aversion.
There are three kinds of right thought:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thoughts of renunciation (<em>nekkhamma-saṅkappa</em>;
<em>nekkhamma-vitakka</em>): thoughts free from greed; thoughts free from
sensuality, unpreoccupied with objects gratifying desire;
non-selfish thoughts; thoughts of relinquishment; the entire range
of wholesome thinking.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup> This form of thought is classified as
thought free from lust (<em>rāga</em>) or greed (<em>lobha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thoughts of non-ill-will (<em>abyāpāda-saṅkappa</em>; <em>abyāpāda-vitakka</em>):
thoughts free from anger, hatred, aversion, and negativity; in
particular, this refers to the opposite qualities to ill-will: to
have thoughts of lovingkindness, well-wishing, and friendliness –
the wish for others to be happy. This form of thought is classified
as thought free from hatred (<em>dosa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thoughts of non-cruelty (<em>avihiṁsā-saṅkappa</em>; <em>avihiṁsā-vitakka</em>):
thoughts free from oppression – free from the intention to harm or
injure; in particular, this refers to the opposite quality: to have
compassion – the wish to help others be free from suffering. This
form of thought is similarly classified as thought free from hatred
(<em>dosa</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the context of Buddha-Dhamma, when referring to a wholesome or
virtuous quality that stands in contrast to an unwholesome or negative
quality, instead of using an opposite (i.e. positive) term, more often a
negating term is used. This leads some people to think that Buddhism is
a negative or passive teaching: it teaches that goodness is merely the
abstention from bad actions and an abiding in a state of passivity. In
the above context, ‘wrong thinking’ is defined as thoughts of ill-will,
but ‘right thinking’, rather than being specifically defined as loving
thoughts, is defined as thoughts of non-ill-will – a negation of wrong
thinking.</p>
<p>I will address the misunderstanding that Buddhism is a negative or
passive teaching at more length below,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup> but allow me to offer three
short explanations here refuting these charges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Eightfold Path emphasizes wisdom; its goal is realization of the
truth. It does not give sole importance to the stage of morality.</p>
<p>One should recognize that right thought (<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>) is a Path
factor of wisdom, not of morality. The principle of right thought,
which encourages people to abstain from ill-will and to cultivate
lovingkindness, does not aim merely at establishing virtuous conduct
– of refraining from killing and persecution, or of mutual
assistance. It aims primarily at generating non-biased thinking, not
influenced for example by hatred, in order for the thinking process
to be free and unobstructed, following in line with truth. In this
way there arises correct and undistorted understanding.</p>
<p>The best way to explain right thought is thus through negation – as
free from greed, ill-will, and cruelty. In the act of thinking or
contemplating, if one is able to abstain from thoughts of
covetousness and ill-will, or the wish to harm or injure others, the
thought process will be pure and is likely to accord with truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to Pali grammar, in some cases the negating prefix ‘a-’
has a comprehensive meaning, referring both to the specific opposite
of the word in question and to anything that is distinct from the
quality beings discussed (in the sense of ‘not this’ or an ‘absence
of this’.). In other cases it refers specifically to the opposite of
the word in question. {705}</p>
<p>The term <em>akusala</em>, for example, does not mean ‘not wholesome’
(which could refer to indeterminate or neutral factors – neither
good nor bad), but refers specifically to that which is unwholesome
– the opposite to wholesome.</p>
<p>The term <em>amitta</em> does not refer to a neutral person – someone who
is not a friend – but specifically to an enemy.</p>
<p>In the context of right thought, however, the negating prefix ‘a-’
is comprehensive, referring both to the opposite and to whatever is
distinct from the quality in question. The term <em>abyāpāda-saṅkappa</em>,
for example, refers both to lovingkindness, which is the opposite to
ill-will, and to pure, non-biased thoughts free from ill-will.
Wholesome qualities like lovingkindness are thus already inherent in
this Path factor of right thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The meaning of the negating prefix ‘a-’, besides being comprehensive
as mentioned above, is also more definite and categorical than the
meaning of a term opposite to a quality in question. This prefix
specifies the complete and thorough negation of an object, so that
no trace of it remains.</p>
<p>The term <em>abyāpāda-saṅkappa</em>, for example, refers to thinking that
is completely free from ill-will: it refers to unbounded, supreme
kindness. This is different from the teachings on kindness and
compassion found in some other doctrines, which limit these
qualities, by stating that only specific groups of people or
specific kinds of living creatures are worthy of such kindness. In
truth, all beings are worthy of kindness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally speaking, people engage in thinking in order to satisfy
craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) in one way or another. Their thoughts may be subtly
influenced by fixed view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>), e.g. personal values.
Alternatively, they may think subject to raw craving arising in that
moment, which can manifest in three ways: as desire referred to as
direct or explicit craving (<em>taṇhā</em>); as conceit (<em>māna</em>) –
self-aggrandizement, boosting the ego, protecting one’s status, etc.; or
as an attachment to cherished views (<em>diṭṭhi</em>). The thinking of
unawakened people is thus said to be accompanied by ‘I-making’
(<em>ahaṅkāra</em>), ‘my-making’ (<em>mamaṅkāra</em>), and an underlying tendency to
conceit (<em>mānānusaya</em>); it is intertwined with fixed views (<em>diṭṭhi</em>),
craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), and conceit (<em>māna</em>). In sum, one can say that their
thinking functions to serve craving.</p>
<p>Thinking in order to satisfy craving can occur in both an affirmative
and a negative fashion. As an affirmation it manifests as thoughts of
sensuality: thoughts of acquisition, self-gratification, and
self-indulgence. As a negation it manifests as thoughts of ill-will –
thoughts of conflict, negativity, dissatisfaction, antagonism, rivalry
(fearing that others will get in one’s way), animosity, and hatred – or
as thoughts of cruelty, wishing to oppress, prey on, or destroy others.</p>
<p>In any case, thinking that panders to craving can be eliminated by
systematic reflection, which discerns things according to the
truth.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup> Thinking accompanied by this form of systematic reflection
is pure: it is not influenced by sensual desire, ill-will, or cruelty.
It does not veer off or get stuck on one single aspect of an object and
thus has an extensive range of engagement.</p>
<p>In this sense, one can define right thought (<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>) as any
form of thinking that does not involve selfish gratification, malevolent
intent, or thoughts of persecution. This refers to right thought as a
pure component of wisdom, which supports right view directly.</p>
<p>Alternatively, thinking in order to satisfy craving can be eliminated by
systematic reflection which summons up wholesome qualities. Thinking
accompanied by this form of systematic reflection uses thoughts that are
opposite to sensuality, ill-will, and cruelty: i.e. thoughts of
renunciation, lovingkindness, and compassion. It is a way of developing
unique wholesome qualities. Although this form of right thought also
supports right view, it is directly linked to virtuous conduct: it leads
to right speech, right action, and right livelihood, as illustrated on
Figure <a href="#fig-practice-right-thought">The Practice of Right Thought</a>. {706}</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">The Practice of Right Thought</span><a id="fig-practice-right-thought"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/practice-right-thought.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Note that this division simply shows the chief results of distinct forms
of practice; it does not imply that these practices are completely
separate from one another.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig-right-thought-expressions">Right Thought and its Expressions</a> is an illustration of how
right thought is related to the two Path factors of virtuous conduct:
right speech and right action. Right thought here is given expression
through the principles of the four divine abidings (<em>brahmavihāra</em>) and
the four favourable qualities (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>).</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">Right Thought and its Expressions</span><a id="fig-right-thought-expressions"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/right-thought-expressions.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>The connection between right thought and right view is especially
evident in the context of the three root defilements (<em>akusala-mūla</em>):
greed, hatred and delusion. Right view eradicates the most basic
defilement of delusion (<em>moha</em>). Right thought on the other hand
eradicates the affiliated defilements: thoughts of renunciation
eradicate greed or lust, and thoughts of non-ill-will and of non-cruelty
eradicate hatred. In this way these two Path factors are thoroughly
integrated and compatible.</p>
<p>Developing these two initial Path factors is considered an elementary
stage of practice. At the beginning, wisdom has not yet reached the
stage of completion. As with all Path factors, their full range and
potential may not be realized immediately, but rather they must be
developed gradually.</p>
<p>For this reason, in reference to the three kinds of right thought:
‘thoughts of renunciation’ sometimes refers to a basic stage, or to a
symbolic gesture, of taking ordination as a monk or of removing oneself
from the life of a householder; ‘thoughts of non-ill-will’ refers
primarily to the practice of lovingkindness; and ‘thoughts of
non-cruelty’ refers primarily to the practice of compassion.</p>
<p>Granted, the wisdom a person develops here may be an expression of right
view, of seeing things according to the truth, but it is not yet pure
and free – it is not yet a complete realization. Completion is reached
at the stage of equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>), which is based on concentration.</p>
<p>Moreover, even lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>), a virtue one can develop at
initial stages of spiritual practice, is not as simple as people may
commonly think. What people normally refer to as ‘love’ in most cases is
not true lovingkindness. {707}</p>
<p>Let us review some basic principles in relation to lovingkindness:</p>
<p><em>Mettā</em> may be defined as ‘friendliness’, ‘love’, ‘well-wishing’,
‘sympathy’, ‘mutual understanding’, ‘a wish for others to be happy’, or
‘a desire to foster wellbeing for for all living creatures’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Lovingkindness is an impartial quality, both in terms of the person
expressing the love and of the person who receives the love. Love should
be mutual between subordinates and superiors, the rich and the poor,
beggars and millionaires, high-class and low-class people, the laity and
the ordained sangha. Lovingkindness is the first step in building
healthy relationships between people. It leads people to see one another
in a positive light, to express care for one another, and to exchange
ideas in a reasonable manner. People then do not base their actions on
selfishness or aversion.</p>
<p>Lovingkindness (along with the other sublime states of mind –
<em>brahmavihāra</em>) is said to be an attribute of a superior person. Here
the term <em>brahma</em> is defined as ‘one who is superior’. These states of
mind thus belong to one who is excellent, whose heart is expansive, who
is noble by way of virtue. This differs from how people generally judge
a great person.</p>
<p>Buddhism teaches that all people should cultivate and possess the four
sublime states, elevating and broadening their minds. Many people
believe that these qualities are the preserve of leaders in the
community. Although this is a limited understanding, one can say that it
emphasizes responsibility: granted, everyone should develop the divine
abidings, but leaders in particular, being role models, should excel in
these qualities.</p>
<p>But if people hold on to the belief that it is only the responsibility
of leaders or of ‘great people’ to develop these qualities, this will
lead to a distorted understanding.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the advantages (<em>sampatti</em>) and
disadvantages (<em>vipatti</em>) of lovingkindness. <em>Sampatti</em> here can also be
defined as the ‘fulfilment’ or ‘benefit’ of lovingkindness, whereas
<em>vipatti</em> can be defined as the ‘failure’ or ‘shortcoming’ of
lovingkindness, or an ‘incorrect practice’ in relation to it.</p>
<p>According to the scriptures, the advantage of lovingkindness is that it
is able to quell ill-will (<em>byāpādupasamo etissā sampatti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup> The
disadvantage is that it may give rise to infatuation (<em>sinehasambhavo
vipatti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>There are some special observations in regard to this disadvantage: the
term <em>sineha</em> refers to love and affection for an individual – a
personal form of fondness and attachment, e.g.: <em>putta-sineha</em> refers to
love for one’s children, and <em>bhariyā-sineha</em> refers to love for one’s
wife.</p>
<p>Such affection is a cause for favouritism, and it may lead to
inappropriate actions performed to help the person who is the object of
affection. This bias is referred to as <em>chandāgati</em> (’bias due to
love’). Examples for such affection are statements like: ‘He has a
unique love for me’, and, ‘He loves her exceedingly’, which may express
an absence of true lovingkindness. {708}</p>
<p>True love is impartial and preserves objectivity. It leads to altruism
and fairness, to an absence of harmful thoughts, to friendliness and the
wish to help everyone equally, and to reasoned judgements and actions,
aiming for the true welfare of all beings. One does not act out of
personal preference or in order to acquire something. True love is
characterized as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The Blessed One was even and impartial, towards the archer (who was
hired to secretly assassinate the Buddha), towards Devadatta (who
ordered the assassination), towards the bandit Aṅgulimāla, towards the
elephant Dhanapāla (which was released in order to kill the Buddha),
and towards Rāhula (the Buddha’s son), without exception.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Ap. 47-8; DhA. I. 145.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The benefits of lovingkindness are obvious during times of dispute and
debate, when each party is able to consider the other side’s reasoned
arguments and even to realize the truth of these arguments.</p>
<p>An example is the story of a Jain follower who engaged the Buddha in a
discussion and who used harsh words to criticize him. The Buddha
responded using reasoned arguments until the Jain said:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>This being so, I have confidence in Master Gotama. Truly, Master
Gotama is developed in body and developed in mind....</p>
<p>It is wonderful, Master Gotama, it is unprecedented, how when Master
Gotama is insulted by me, cross-examined by discourteous speech, his
complexion remains bright and the colour of his face radiant, as is to
be expected of one who is accomplished and fully enlightened.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 239-40, 250.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the case that wrong thinking (<em>micchā-saṅkappa</em>) has arisen, it
cannot be rectified by headstrong, fretful, or incoherent behaviour.
Instead, one must use systematic reflection, investigating with reasoned
discernment and reflecting on the advantages and disadvantages of
phenomena:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an
unenlightened bodhisatta, it occurred to me: ‘Suppose that I divide my
thoughts into two classes.’ Then I set on one side thoughts of sensual
desire, thoughts of ill-will, and thoughts of cruelty, and I set on
the other side thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of non-ill-will, and
thoughts of non-cruelty.</p>
<p>As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of sensual
desire arose in me. I understood clearly thus: ‘This thought of
sensual desire has arisen in me. This leads to my own affliction, to
others’ affliction, and to the affliction of both; it cuts off wisdom,
is an obstruction, and is unconducive to Nibbāna.’</p>
<p>When I considered: ‘This leads to my own affliction’, it subsided in
me; when I considered: ‘This leads to other’s affliction’ ... ‘This
leads to the affliction of both’, it subsided in me; when I
considered: ‘This cuts off wisdom, is an obstruction, and is
unconducive to Nibbāna’, it subsided in me. Whenever a thought of
sensual desire arose in me, I abandoned it, diminished it, did away
with it.</p>
<p>As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of
ill-will arose in me ... a thought of cruelty arose in me. I
understood clearly.... Whenever a thought of cruelty arose in me, I
abandoned it, diminished it, did away with it. {709}</p>
<p>Monks, whatever a monk frequently thinks about and ponders over, that
will become the inclination of his mind. If he frequently thinks about
and ponders over thoughts of sensual desire, he abandons the thought

his mind inclines to thoughts of sensual desire.... If he frequently
thinks about and ponders over thoughts of renunciation, he abandons
the thought of sensual desire to cultivate the thought of
renunciation, and then his mind inclines to thoughts of renunciation.</p>

<p>The initial stage of spiritual practice incorporating these two Path
factors can be summarized as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, a monk possessed of four things is called one who follows an
unerring way of practice and who begins to build the basis for the
destruction of the taints. The four things are: the thought of
renunciation, the thought of non-ill-will, the thought of non-cruelty,
and right view.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-relationship-between-internal-qualities-and-external-actions" id="appendix-relationship-between-internal-qualities-and-external-actions">Appendix: Relationship between Internal Qualities and External Actions</a></h2>
<p>The earlier illustration in the section titled ‘Right Thought
(<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>)’ combines the dual teachings on the four divine
abidings (<em>brahmavihāra</em>) and on the four favourable qualities
(<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>) with three of the Path factors: the divine abidings
are included in the factor of right thought, and the four favourable
qualities are included in the two factors of right speech and right
action. The purpose for combining these is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To prevent confusion and to enable a correct distinction between
fundamental mental qualities (behaviour on the level of thought) and
qualities which are expressed outwards (behaviour on the level of
external conduct). In particular, there tends be confusion about the
four divine abidings, which some people talk about or define as
forms of outward practice and conduct.</p>
<p>In fact these abidings, say of lovingkindness, are inherent mental
qualities; they exist on the level of thinking and are associated
with right thought. The cultivation of these abidings is included in
the section of concentration (<em>samādhi</em>) or in the training in
higher mind (<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>). For this reason, the four divine
abidings are classified as one group of meditation (<em>kammaṭṭhāna</em>)
in the list of forty meditation techniques: they are connected with
‘mental cultivation’ (<em>citta-bhāvanā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>On the level of outward conduct, the four favourable qualities take
over from the divine abidings and function as expressions of these
abidings in a person’s social environment. If one wishes to describe
lovingkindness in the context of outward expression, one must link
it with an external action, for example by saying: ‘Physical actions
accompanied by lovingkindness’, or: ‘Speech accompanied by
lovingkindness.’ <em>Mettā</em> on its own is not an action on the level of
outward conduct. In contrast, acts of generosity, kindly speech, and
acts of service, for example, which are part of virtuous conduct
(<em>sīla</em>), are external, social actions.</p>
<p>An understanding of these principles enables Buddhists to practise
these teachings in a more correct, clear, and definite way.
Buddhists will also recognize the flaws in the accusations by other
people, who claim that Buddhists have been taught to do good simply
by idly sitting in their rooms and spreading lovingkindness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To illustrate the relationship between internal, mental qualities
and external practice in the context of society; to describe the
complete, well-ordered system of Buddha-Dhamma, which addresses all
levels of spiritual practice; to reveal how expressions of outward
goodness – virtuous actions in relation to society – must be
rooted in deep-seated mental qualities in order for them to be
stable, lasting, pure, and true. Beneficial social actions, say of
giving or acts of service, are only pure and genuine when they are
based on a foundation of lovingkindness and compassion.</p>

<p>Similar passages occur at: D. II. 216-17; A. V. 236-7. The
expression ‘comes into being’ is a translation of the Pali term
<em>pahoti</em>, which can also be translated as ‘suitable for application’
or ‘workable’. Passages at S. V. 1-2 &amp; A. V. 214 present a deeper
analysis, stating that although right view is the leader of all the
Path factors, knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>) is the leader in the undertaking
of all wholesome qualities and is the source of right view.
(Similarly, ignorance – <em>avijjā</em> – is the leader for all
unwholesome qualities and is the source of wrong view.)</p>

<p>In the Pali Canon there are two equivalent terms which often
accompany <em>diṭṭhi</em> to form the following group: <em>diṭṭhi</em> (view),
<em>khanti</em> (things conforming with personal understanding), and <em>ruci</em>
(preferences or agreeable notions), e.g.: Vin. I. 69-70; Nd. I. 40;
Ps. I. 176; Vbh. 245, 324-5. See also the section in chapter 2 on
the different kinds and stages of knowledge. Although the term
<em>diṭṭhi</em> corresponds to the English word ‘attitude’, this latter
word also corresponds in part to <em>saṅkappa</em> (thought; intention) –
the second Path factor.</p>

<p><em>Diṭṭhi</em> as mental kamma in the teaching on the courses of action

<p>The commentaries refer to this form of right view as ‘insight
right view’ (<em>vipassanā-sammādiṭṭhi</em>); the original Pali term for it
is ‘knowledge conforming to truth’ (<em>saccānulomika-ñāṇa</em>). (In the
commentaries this latter term is specifically used in reference to
the final stage of the nine kinds of insight knowledge –
<em>vipassanā-ñāṇa</em>.)</p>

<p>Both negative values and negative emotions are a result of

or modified craving, while the latter are an expression of pure

<p>This is a very general explanation, focusing on the main
principles involved. In fact there are also physical laws, genetic
laws, and psychic laws, but these are not relevant to the present
discussion. (<em>Dhamma-niyāma</em>: general laws of nature, especially
those of cause and effect; laws concerning the interrelationship of
all things. <em>Kamma-niyāma</em> (kammic laws): laws concerning intention
and human behaviour, i.e. the law of actions – <em>kamma</em> – and their
results.)</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>On a fundamental level, morality (<em>sīla</em>; virtuous conduct) is an
objective truth. It is described by the three Path factors of right
speech, right action, and right livelihood: it refers to intentional
speech, action, and livelihood that is free from evil, immoral conduct
and from thoughts of harm and oppression, and it incorporates
corresponding virtuous, upright behaviour.</p>
<p>From the outset, Buddhist practitioners should clearly discern the
purpose and objectives of those moral practices that they uphold and
undertake. They should understand how virtuous conduct fits into a wider
system of spiritual training, recognizing that the deepening of virtue
is related to mind development and wisdom development. Virtuous conduct
supports concentration and leads to clear knowledge and vision
(<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>). It leads to the end of suffering, to blessings, and to
true wellbeing. And it is essential for happiness, both for an
individual and for society.</p>
<p>The Noble Eightfold Path, comprising a complete set of spiritual
factors, is divided into three groups: virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>),
concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). These three main
factors also comprise the threefold training – the training in higher
virtue (<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>), the training in higher mind
(<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>), and the training in higher wisdom
(<em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>) – which may be simply rendered as <em>sīla</em>,
<em>samādhi</em>, and <em>paññā</em>.</p>
<p>The entire Buddhist practice, training, discipline, spiritual
development, and path to Nibbāna is incorporated within this threefold
training, derived from the Eightfold Path. True, genuine, and complete
moral conduct refers to the three Path factors contained within the
<em>sīla</em> group, i.e. right speech, right action, and right livelihood.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#path-factors-of-virtuous-conduct-1" id="path-factors-of-virtuous-conduct-1">Path Factors of Virtuous Conduct</a></h2>
<p>The section of the Eightfold Path on virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>) contains
three factors: right speech (<em>sammā-vācā</em>), right action
(<em>sammā-kammanta</em>), and right livelihood (<em>sammā-ājīva</em>). Here is an
example of how these three factors are defined in the scriptures:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>And what, monks, is right speech? This is called right speech:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To abstain from false speech (<em>musāvādā veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from divisive speech (<em>pisuṇāya vācāya veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from harsh speech (<em>pharusā vācāya veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from idle chatter (<em>samphappalāpā veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>And what, monks, is right action? This is called right action:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To abstain from killing living beings (<em>pāṇātipātā veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from taking what is not freely given (<em>adinnādānā
veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from sexual misconduct (<em>kāmesumicchācārā veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>And what, monks, is right livelihood? This is called right
livelihood: here a noble disciple, having abandoned wrong
livelihood,</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <em>earns his living by right livelihood.</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also definitions for these three factors distinguishing
between the mundane level and the transcendent. The definitions for the
mundane level are the same as those above; the definitions for the
transcendent are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Transcendent right speech:</em> the refraining, the avoidance, the
abstinence from, the intention to desist from the four kinds of
verbal misconduct in one whose mind is noble, whose mind is
taintless, who has attained to the noble path, and is developing the
noble path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Transcendent right action:</em> the refraining, the avoidance, the
abstinence from, the intention to desist from the three kinds of
physical misconduct in one whose mind is noble ... and is developing
the noble path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Transcendent right livelihood:</em> the refraining, the avoidance, the
abstinence from, the intention to desist from wrong livelihood in
one whose mind is noble ... and is developing the noble path.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>
{711}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="header" href="#universal-principles-of-morality" id="universal-principles-of-morality">Universal Principles of Morality</a></h2>
<p>The Buddhist teachings expand upon the essential principles of moral
training – collectively referred to as the ‘training in higher virtue’
(<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>) – in a detailed and comprehensive way. Various
precepts and moral standards are established for practical application
in order to generate wholesome results for both an individual and for
all of society. This practical outline of moral conduct begins with a
teaching on behaviour – the ten wholesome courses of action
(<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>) – corresponding to the three factors of the Noble
Path mentioned above, and with a teaching on the most basic form of
moral conduct: the five precepts.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>There is, however, no limit to the expansion and details of such a
practical outline of moral conduct: teachings are presented in the texts
according to specific individuals, time periods, locations, and other
related circumstances. It is not possible here to compile all of these
varied and detailed teachings on moral conduct.</p>
<p>It is sufficient to present the central principles of the Buddhist
teachings on virtuous conduct, which are described in the scriptures in
a clearly defined way. I will leave it up to the reader to find specific
teachings that match their disposition, life circumstances, and aims.</p>
<p>Leaving aside teachings appropriate to specific individuals, time
periods, places, and occasions, a key factor in determining practical
teachings on virtuous conduct is a person’s occupation or state of
living. For this reason there are distinct codes of conduct, precepts,
and systems of practice for householders and for renunciants.</p>
<p>A student of Buddhism must understand the principles, value, and most
importantly the objectives of these distinct ethical codes, both in
their variant details and in their ultimate unity and concordance, in
order to possess a true understanding of this subject and to practise
the Dhamma correctly.</p>
<p>A key example of distilling the essence of the Path factors related to
virtuous conduct and presenting practical principles of conduct is the
teaching on the ten wholesome ways of conduct (<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>).
This teaching matches the Path factors directly; it only differs in so
far as it arranges physical action (corresponding to ‘right action’)
before verbal action (corresponding to ‘right speech’). This teaching is
known by other names, including: ‘upright conduct’ (<em>sucarita</em>), ‘purity
by way of body, speech, (and mind)’, and ‘excellence of action’.
Following is a passage from the Pali Canon describing this teaching:</p>
<p>At one time when the Buddha was staying at Pāvā in the mango grove of
the silversmith Cunda, Cunda approached the Buddha and they conversed on
‘acts of purification’ (<em>soceyya-kamma</em>). Cunda said that he approves of
the purifying rites prescribed by the brahmans of the western districts,
who carry waterpots, wear garlands of waterweed, worship fire, and
submerge themselves in water.</p>
<p>According to these rites, in the early morning on rising from one’s bed
a person must touch the earth. If he does not touch the earth, then he
must touch fresh cow-dung, or green grass, or tend to a fire, or pay
reverence to the sun, or else he must descend into water three times in
the evening. (See
Note <a href="#note-superstitious-rites">Superstitious Rites</a>) {712}</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Superstitious Rites</span><a id="note-superstitious-rites"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such unyielding adherence to moral precepts and religious practices
(<em>sīlabbataparāmāsa</em>) has been widespread in India from the Buddha’s
time to the present day without abating. Abolishing this form of blind
belief was one of the Buddha’s primary intentions in his teaching and
activities, along with abolishing the caste system and drawing people
away from metaphysical speculations towards a consideration of more
pertinent and valid questions.</p>
<p>An increasing adherence to this blind belief and to superstitious
rites and ceremonies accompanied the demise of Buddhism in India, and
was indeed a crucial factor for its demise. It is fair to say that
such blind belief shapes the state of Indian society today. Wherever
such blind belief in religious precepts and practices increases, an
upholding of the true Buddhist teachings will fall into decline.</p>
<p>In the history of human civilizations, such a firm adherence to rites
and ceremonies (even to ones that are more rational than those
mentioned above) have led to violent social revolution and even to the
end of these civilizations.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha answered that the self-purifying rites of these brahmans are
different from the self-purification found in the noble discipline
(<em>ariya-vinaya</em>). People who engage in the ten unwholesome courses of
action (killing living beings, stealing, etc. – the opposite factors to
the ten wholesome courses of action) are impure in body, speech and
mind. Regardless of whether they touch the earth, touch cowdung, worship
fire, honour the sun, or refrain from these actions they remain impure,
because these unwholesome ways of action are inherently impure and lead
to impurity.</p>
<p>The Buddha then described the ten ways of wholesome action, which lead
to self-purification (<em>soceyya</em>):</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Three kinds of purification by way of the body:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> A person abandons the killing of living beings (<em>pāṇātipāta</em>),
abstains from taking life; with rod and weapon laid aside,
conscientious and kind, he abides compassionate and eager to help
all living beings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.</strong> A person abandons from taking what is not freely given
(<em>adinnādāna</em>) and abstains therefrom; he does not take with
thievish intent the property of another, situated at home or in the
forest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.</strong> A person abandons sexual misconduct (<em>kāmesu-micchācāra</em>) and
abstains therefrom; he does not violate women who are protected by
their mother, father, brother, sister, or relatives, who are
protected by the Dhamma (e.g. by legal guardianship), who have a
husband, women who are off limits, even those who are engaged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Four kinds of purification by way of speech:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>4.</strong> A person abandons false speech (<em>musāvāda</em>), abstains from false
speech; when summoned to a court, or to a meeting, or to his
relatives’ presence, or to an assembly, or to the royal family’s
presence, and questioned as a witness thus: ‘So, good man, tell what
you know’, not knowing, he says, ‘I do not know’, or knowing, he
says, ‘I know’; not seeing, he says, ‘I do not see’, or seeing, he
says, ‘I see’; he does not in full awareness speak falsehood for his
own ends, or for another’s ends, or for some form of reward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.</strong> A person abandons divisive speech (<em>pisuṇā-vācā</em>), abstains from
divisive speech; he does not repeat elsewhere what he has heard here
in order to divide those people from these, nor does he repeat to
these people what he has heard elsewhere in order to divide these
people from those; thus he is one who reunites those who are
divided, a promoter of solidarity, who enjoys concord, rejoices in
concord, delights in concord, a speaker of words that promote
concord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>6.</strong> A person abandons harsh speech (<em>pharusa-vācā</em>), abstains from harsh
speech; he speaks such words as are unoffensive, pleasing to the ear
and loveable, words that go to the heart, are courteous, agreeable
to many and delightful to many.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>7.</strong> A person abandons [unreflective] chatter (<em>samphappalāpa</em>),
abstains from trivial talk; he speaks at the right time, speaks what
is fact, speaks on what is good, speaks on the Dhamma and the
Discipline; at the right time he speaks such words as can be
substantiated, are relevant, moderate, and beneficial.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Three kinds of purification by way of mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>8.</strong> non-covetousness (<em>anabhijjhā</em>),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>9.</strong> non-ill-will (<em>abyāpāda</em>; the wish for all beings to abide in
happiness), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10.</strong> right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These three factors are an extension of the first two factors of the
Eightfold Path: right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>) and right intention
(<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>): {713}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A person endowed with these ten wholesome courses of action, in the
early morning on rising from his bed, if he touches the earth he is
pure, if he does not touch the earth he is pure ... if he pays
reverence to the sun he is pure, if he does not pay reverence to the
sun he is pure ... because these ten wholesome courses of action are
inherently pure and they lead to purification.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. V. 263.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Earlier it was mentioned that the essential principles of virtuous
conduct are expanded for practical purposes, suitable to particular
circumstances. For example, in reference to someone who has been
ordained as a monk, apart from the adjustment and addition of specific
moral precepts, even those precepts that remain the same are sometimes
interpreted in a new way. Compare these precepts on stealing and lying
with the definitions presented above in the ten courses of wholesome
action:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking
what is not given; taking only what is given, expecting only what is
given, by not stealing he abides in purity.</p>
<p>Abandoning false speech, he abstains from false speech; he speaks
truth, upholds the truth, is trustworthy and reliable, one who is no
deceiver of the world.</p>
<p><em>D. I. 4-5, 63-4, 100-101, etc.; M. I. 267-8, 345; A. V. 204-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The expanded definitions for the factors of the Eightfold Path related
to virtuous conduct are usually divided into two parts. The first part
describes the refraining from doing evil, and the latter part describes
performing a wholesome activity, which opposes the unskilful action that
the person is avoiding. The former part employs language of negation;
the latter part employs language of promotion or affirmation.</p>
<p>This pairing of ‘negative’ and ‘positive’ instruction is a common
attribute of the Buddhist teachings, in line with the principle:
‘refrain from evil, cultivate the good’.</p>
<p>Beginning with the refraining from evil, the cultivation of the good can
be expanded on progressively, which is not limited to these factors of
the Path. For example, in regard to theft (<em>adinnādāna</em>), although the
teachings cited above are not expanded into a clear application of
cultivating wholesome qualities, there are other, complementary
teachings on the key Buddhist principle of generosity (<em>dāna</em>).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#theistic-morality-vs-a-doctrine-of-natural-truth" id="theistic-morality-vs-a-doctrine-of-natural-truth">Theistic Morality vs a Doctrine of Natural Truth</a></h2>
<p>Some Western scholars have criticized Buddhism for teaching in an
exclusively negative way. They claim that Buddhism teaches people to
solely refrain from evil, but it does not encourage people to exert
themselves in a positive way by doing good; Buddhism does not advise
people how to promote goodness once they have refrained from wrongdoing;
Buddhism is merely a teaching of subjectivity, an ‘ethic of abstract
thinking’, a teaching of resignation and passivity. They go on to say
that Buddhist teachings lead Buddhists to be contented merely with
avoiding evil, but they take no interest in helping other human beings
find freedom from suffering and discover true happiness. {714}</p>
<p>These scholars claim that even though Buddhism teaches lovingkindness
and compassion, these qualities are confined simply to mental
activities. They draw upon passages in the Tipiṭaka to support their
view that the Buddhist teachings are exclusively negative. For example,
they cite the definition for right action (<em>sammā-kammanta</em>) presented
by Ven. Sāriputta:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And what, friends, is right action? Abstaining from killing living
beings, abstaining from taking what is not given, and abstaining from
misconduct in sensual pleasures – this is called right action.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. III. 251-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Someone who recognizes the true practical application of these Path
factors, as is outlined for example in the elaboration of moral conduct
contained in the ten wholesome courses of action, will see that these
scholars who offer criticism (much of which is well-intentioned) surely
have garnered only an incomplete knowledge and do not understand
Buddha-Dhamma in its entirety. It is clear that the system of virtuous
conduct based on these factors of the Path is not restricted to being
‘negative’, ‘passive’, ‘subjective’, or merely an ‘ethic of abstract
thinking’.</p>
<p>In any case, when one encounters such criticisms, one should take the
opportunity to clarify these matters within oneself and expand one’s
understanding. The explanations of the moral factors of the Path refer
to basic behaviour linked with intention. They are initially defined
through a terminology of negation (i.e. the definitions emphasize the
refraining from evil) for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Buddhism, moral precepts and codes of conduct are not divine
edicts or commandments etched in stone, which through God’s will
stipulate how people should behave, often through blind faith,
without needing to understand the justifications for moral
behaviour. {715}</p>
<p>In Buddha-Dhamma, moral precepts are determined according to laws of
nature, and collectively they constitute the beginning stage of
spiritual development. Someone who upholds these precepts ought to
discern the relationship to these natural laws. Although one may not
yet possess a clear understanding and may only act at the level of
faith, this faith should be ‘well-grounded’ (<em>ākāravatī-saddhā</em>) –
it should at least be based on a rudimentary understanding of cause
and effect, enough to give rise to increasing degrees of wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the gradual development of Dhamma practice or of spiritual
training, one must prepare a stable and even foundation. One begins
with refraining from or eliminating unwholesome actions, before one
cultivates goodness and eventually reaches purity and liberation.
This is similar to growing a fruit tree: one must first prepare the
soil by removing harmful elements; then one is ready to plant the
seed, nurture the plant, and harvest one’s desired fruit.</p>
<p>In Buddha-Dhamma, virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>) is the first stage of
practice, in which the emphasis is on refraining from unskilful
actions. At first there is a repeated focus on those things that
need to be eliminated, after which the boundaries of spiritual
practice can be expanded, by gradually including the elevated stages
of concentration and wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within the system of the threefold training, moral conduct in itself
is not a practice leading to the highest goal. Rather, it prepares
the general foundation of one’s life and makes one ready to
cultivate the essential factor of mental development, which is
referred to in brief as ‘concentration’ (<em>samādhi</em>). This next stage
of development follows on from and reaps the benefits of moral
conduct.</p>
<p>The spiritual value of moral conduct is tremendous: the intention to
refrain from evil or the absence of any thoughts of wrongdoing
purifies and steadies the mind; a person is thus not disturbed by
confusion, distress, or anxiety. The mind becomes tranquil and
concentrated.</p>
<p>When the mind is peaceful and concentrated, one develops clarity and
proficiency in wisdom – one uses reasoned discernment and seeks
ways to further cultivate goodness and to reach higher stages of
spiritual accomplishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being endowed with a strong, virtuous, and joyous mind is of vital
importance. In Buddhist ethics there must be a constant link and
integration between one’s state of mind and one’s external physical
and verbal actions. The mind is the source of all action, and
therefore intention is the principal factor in determining the true
sincerity of a person’s virtuous deeds. Not deceiving others is an
inadequate yardstick – there must also be an absence of
self-deception. Developing a wholesome integration of factors
uplifts the mind and prevents the problem of mental behaviour and
external behaviour being at odds with one another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Path factors related to moral conduct reveal that the most basic
form of human responsibility is to take responsibility for one’s own
mind: to guard against all thoughts of harming or violating others.
When a person has established this basic purity of mind, personal
responsibility expands outwards to sustaining and cultivating
spiritual qualities and performing virtuous deeds in order to help
others. In sum, there is the personal responsibility to refrain from
evil and the social responsibility to act for others’ wellbeing and
happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To interpret <em>sīla</em> as the refraining from harm and wrongdoing is to
define the principles of spiritual practice in a basic and uniform
way. This interpretation emphasizes volition that is completely free
from corruption and wickedness. When one has achieved such a basic
discipline and freedom from affliction and turmoil, both internal
and external, one can begin to expand on and cultivate aspects of
wholesome and virtuous conduct. {716}</p>
<p>In regard to goodness, its details and methods of practice are
limitless and vary according to time and place. Unskilful actions,
on the other hand, can be strictly defined and determined. For
example, both monks and laypeople should refrain from telling lies,
but the opportunities and methods for undertaking wholesome
activities based on honest speech may vary. The all-inclusive
principles of behaviour thus specify the refraining from basic forms
of wrongdoing. The details and methods of cultivating goodness are
matters of practical application, depending on a person’s life
circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To arrive at the goal of Buddhism it is necessary to develop every
factor of the Eightfold Path. Therefore, each Path factor must be an
all-inclusive principle which every person is able to follow and
practise, not limited to a person’s social standing, time period,
location, or specific surrounding conditions.</p>
<p>This is clearly evident in the domain of moral conduct. For example,
to abstain from taking what is not freely given is something that
every person can do, but the offering of gifts depends on other
factors, like having something to give, having a recipient, and
having a worthy recipient. In the case that a person does not have
the opportunity to give, intention that is free from any thoughts of
stealing already purifies the mind and acts as a foundation for
concentration. If one has the opportunity to give, however, this
giving will increase one’s virtue and prevent the mental stain of
being uncaring or possessive.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that the primary interpretations of these
Path factors of morality exist in the form of negation: of
abstaining from unskilful behaviour or of an absence of evil. The
expanded interpretation of these Path factors which includes the
positive acts of generating goodness is a matter of practical
application as mentioned above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Dhamma practice, practitioners are often consciously developing a
specific spiritual quality or virtue. During this time the
practitioner must be absorbed in and focused on that activity. In
such circumstances one’s responsibility concerning other areas of
practice is simply to prevent harmful or unskilful conditions from
arising. Here, the desired benefit from moral conduct is to help
regulate other areas of activity: to prevent one from erring and
committing an unskilful action, to be free from mental weakness and
disturbance, and to prepare a firm foundation in order to develop
the chosen virtuous quality completely and resolutely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, the Buddhist system of spiritual training is
threefold, comprising moral conduct, concentration, and wisdom;
moreover, it is based on natural phenomena. Many of the critical
scholars mentioned above, however, view morality from the perspective of
a theistic tradition, and thus they can make neither head nor tail of
the Buddhist system. It is important to distinguish between moral
conduct as taught in Buddha-Dhamma and moral conduct as taught in
theistic religions (this analysis should include those teachings on
kamma and on good and evil). Here are some important points on this
distinction:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the doctrine of natural truth (<em>sabhāva-niyāma</em>), i.e.
Buddha-Dhamma, principles of moral behaviour are determined and
defined according to causal laws of nature. In theistic religions
moral principles are divine commandments laid down according to
divine will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the angle of ‘negation’ or restraint, moral conduct in
Buddha-Dhamma is a principle of self-discipline and self-training,
and therefore the prescribed precepts are referred to as ‘training
rules’ (<em>sikkhā-pada</em>). As for moral conduct in theistic religions,
it is comprised of prohibitions – of commandments laid down from a
power above. {717}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Buddha-Dhamma a vital factor for moral conduct is ‘well-grounded
faith’ (<em>ākāravatī-saddhā</em>): a trust in natural laws and a basic
understanding that volitional actions and their results proceed in
accord with causes and conditions. A vital factor for moral conduct
in theistic religions is devotional faith (<em>bhatti</em>): a belief in,
acceptance of, and obedience to those things prescribed by God, and
a complete entrusting oneself to these prescriptions without needing
to question their validity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Buddha-Dhamma a correct upholding of moral precepts entails
self-discipline, beginning with the intention to refrain from all
vices and followed by the development of virtues which are
diametrically opposed to such vices. In theistic religions the
upholding of moral precepts entails strict obedience to divine
commandments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Buddha-Dhamma, practice on the level of moral conduct has the
specific objective of acting as a foundation for concentration. It
is part of a system of training designed to prepare and enable a
person to harness the power of the mind in the greatest way
possible, eventually giving rise to wisdom and leading in the end to
perfect mental freedom. As for say, going to heaven, this is merely
a natural consequence of causes and conditions. In theistic
religions, however, upholding the commandments leads to divine
favour; it is conduct that accords with God’s will and results in
the reward of being born in heaven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Buddha-Dhamma, the good and bad results of moral or immoral
behaviour occur automatically according to a natural order; they
stem from the impartial, objective functioning of a natural law,
referred to as the law of kamma. These effects first manifest in the
mind and then manifest further in a person’s personality and way of
life, in this lifetime and in future lifetimes. In theistic
religions the good and bad results of keeping or transgressing
divine commandments are a matter of reward or retribution. The
reward for obedience is going to heaven; the punishment for
transgression is going to hell. The reward or punishment is
determined solely by divine judgement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In regard to good and evil, Buddha-Dhamma teaches that moral virtue
protects, enhances, purifies and elevates the mind, and it is thus
referred to as <em>puñña</em> (’merit’, ‘meritorious’). Moral conduct
promotes mental prosperity and mental health; it is a skilful
action, it conforms to wisdom, and it leads to liberation; thus it
is called <em>kusala</em> (’wholesome’, ‘skilful’). Wicked, immoral
behaviour on the other hand impairs or decreases the quality of the
mind, and thus it is called <em>pāpa</em> (’evil’).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> It damages a
person’s life, it is unskilful, and it is conducive neither to
mental wellbeing nor to liberation; thus it is called <em>akusala</em>
(’unskilful’, ‘unwholesome’). In theistic religions, good and evil
is based primarily on faith and devotion: behaviour is measured by
obedience and conformity to God’s will and commands. Evil in
particular is interpreted as behaviour opposing or transgressing the
will of God (commonly called ‘sin’).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Buddha-Dhamma it is imperative that teachings on morality be
based on reason, for Dhamma practitioners only conduct themselves
correctly when they understand how the system of ethics is connected
to the law of causality. The prevailing morality of theistic
religions is based on divine proclamations and divine decree which
is comprised of disparate rules and precepts. Although these rules
may be compiled into an ethical code, they are not part of an
integrated system, because a follower of such a religion requires
only enough understanding to determine what rules have been laid
down. {718} It is not necessary to understand the entire system or
the relationship to other factors because the larger design exists
in God’s all-knowing wisdom; followers ought not to doubt, but
rather they should surrender themselves and follow obediently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Buddhist system of ethics is comprised of objective and
universal principles; it is determined according to laws of nature.
(Here ethics refers to the essence of <em>sīla</em>, as the aspects of
truth dealing with good and evil; it is not referring to <em>sīla</em> as a
prescribed code of discipline – <em>vinaya</em>, which involves forms of
correction and punishment within a social setting.) In theistic
religions, ethical principles tend to be determined according to
divine will; the code of ethics resembles a prescribed code of
discipline (<em>vinaya</em>) or a legal code, because God is both the
enactor of these laws and the judge.</p>
<p>Buddha-Dhamma teaches that specific volitional actions have specific
effects on a person’s mind, behaviour, disposition, and personality.
In this context, it is invalid to set limitations or qualifications
on such effects of volitional action, for example by claiming that a
particular group of people has an advantage, or to use personal
approval as the criterion for truth. It is invalid to make the
following claims: only members of this specific religion are
compassionate and good, but members of other religions, although
they may express compassion, are not truly good; killing people of
this religion is a sin, but killing people of other religions is not
a sin; only virtuous people of this religion can go to heaven, while
people of other religions, regardless how they behave, are infidels
and are destined for hell; killing animals is not a sin, because
animals are intended as food for humans (are we not food for lions
and tigers?).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Having said this, it is valid, however, to distinguish between
different kinds of volitional actions, for instance by observing how
various degrees of unskilful behaviour effect the functioning of the
mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because moral conduct is based on objective principles and
determined according to natural laws, Buddhist practitioners require
courage and honesty to acknowledge and face the truth. They are
urged to accept the truth of conditions, that good and evil, right
and wrong, exist within themselves and within the world. Whether
people practise accordingly or not, and to what extent they
practise, is another matter. People need to acknowledge whether they
are acting in conformity with these natural laws or not; they should
not consider an evil deed as good simply because it accords with
their desires. The validity of natural laws governing human
behaviour does not depend on people’s desires. If one is about to
perform an action that results in falling into hell, it is better to
acknowledge that this action is bad, but that one is still willing
to suffer the consequences, than to delude oneself into thinking
that one is doing nothing wrong.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Admittedly, there are some benefits or advantages to an ethics based on
divine mandate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It cuts off the need to debate whether an action is correct or
incorrect, true or false. Unquestioned belief and devotional faith
often generate ardent effort and quick results in spiritual
practice. But it also tends to create problems, e.g.: problems about
what should be done in order to instil faith in people (especially
in this age of reason); problems about how to live at peace with
other people who do not share one’s beliefs; the problem of how to
sustain faith; and a diminished opportunity for people to exercise
their wisdom faculty freely. (Some of these problems can be
overlooked if one is content for human society to be split into
divergent groups.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ordinary people tend to find a moral system based on faith and
devotion more accessible, and this kind of moral system does a good
job at regulating ordinary people’s behaviour. Even among many
Buddhists the understanding of <em>sīla</em> in relation to good and evil
harbours beliefs that resemble those of theistic religions, for
example to view ethics as a set of prohibitions (but with only an
obscure idea of who prohibits, as opposed to theistic doctrines
which clearly state that God prohibits), and to view the results of
good and evil as a form of reward or punishment. The problem with
such a system, however, is that it relies primarily on faith. {719}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can provide people with moral loopholes. By determining
unwholesome actions as innocent or innocuous, people may justify
them in order to gain something for themselves. Take for example the
notion that killing animals is not a sin, which assuages people’s
sense of guilt and makes them feel blameless. Although convincing
oneself of one’s innocence can be effective, it has adverse effects
in other areas of one’s life and it does not accord with the path of
wisdom.</p>
<p>Buddha-Dhamma encourages people to have a clear awareness of the
truth at every stage of spiritual practice, and to be able to
determine and judge the truth for themselves. It teaches people to
use methods of self-motivation and independent action which include
a thorough understanding of the factors involved. These methods of
self-motivation should be harmless and only be used as a support for
generating other spiritual qualities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#basic-moral-conduct" id="basic-moral-conduct">Basic Moral Conduct</a></h2>
<p>It is important to recognize some general principles that assist in the
proper practice of moral conduct at all levels and enable one to
practise the Dhamma correctly (<em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>).</p>
<p>The Buddha’s words above defining the Path factors of right speech,
right action, and right livelihood reveal the essence of <em>sīla</em>, and
they describe the necessary guidelines of moral conduct required for a
virtuous life. Teachers from ancient times later compiled the eight
subsidiary factors of moral conduct (derived from these three Path
factors), and called them by the name ‘the set of eight precepts of
which pure livelihood is the eighth’ (<em>ājīvaṭṭhamaka-sīla</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> {720}</p>
<p>These are the essential factors of moral conduct. From here, the
analysis of moral conduct branches out. For example, when one describes
a training for a specific group of people with a distinctive way of
life, with distinct objectives and course of development, one may
distinguish various details of practice, as the moral conduct for monks,
for nuns, for novices, for the laity, etc. Moreover, a clear system of
communal management may be established, referred to as a moral
discipline (<em>vinaya</em>), which includes measures for restraint,
administration, the exacting of penalties on transgressors, etc.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s words on the Path factors of moral conduct reveal that the
Path is not intended only for the community of monks; otherwise, the
definition for <em>sīla</em> would have to be the 227 precepts, the virtuous
conduct for bhikkhus (<em>bhikkhu-sīla</em>), the morality of renunciants
(<em>pabbajita-sīla</em>), or something along these lines. The Buddha taught
the essence of moral conduct in a way that incorporates diverse and
detailed moral principles and precepts. It was not necessary for him to
bestow formal titles on some of these subsidiary guidelines for conduct;
for example, he mentioned the five precepts, the eight precepts, and the
ten precepts without giving them explicit names.</p>
<p>Because it is often forgotten, it should be emphasized that <em>sīla</em> does
not refer only to virtuous physical and verbal actions, but also
includes a pure and virtuous livelihood. The way one earns a living has
an important bearing on virtuous conduct.</p>
<p>In the scriptural classification of moral precepts, normally only the
main subjects are mentioned, e.g. to refrain from destroying living
creatures or to refrain from stealing. By glancing at these main
subjects, one may only see them in a negative, or negating, light. To
gain a complete and clear understanding of these precepts, one needs to
look at the Buddha’s words elaborating on their meanings. In the
teaching on the ten wholesome courses of action (<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>),
for instance, one sees that almost every factor is divided into two
parts. There is an aspect to be refrained from and an aspect to be
performed; a negating quality is followed by a positive quality. The
teaching begins with abstaining from an evil action (e.g. killing), and
this is followed by an encouragement to perform a good action that
opposes the unskilful action (e.g. compassionately assisting all living
creatures).</p>
<p>The Path consists of moral conduct, concentration, and wisdom, which
must be fully integrated in order for the fruits of the Path to be
achieved. Although here the discussion focuses on moral conduct, one
needs to be aware that this is merely one stage of an integrated
process. When one advances on the Path, moral conduct must be linked
with the other two factors in order to reach true success.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the fulfilment and perfection resulting from the
complete integration of the Path factors is called the ‘unity of
spiritual qualities’ (<em>dhamma-sāmaggī</em>). Even at the highest level, of
complete awakening, there must be this integration of factors. When one
gains an appreciation of this integration of factors, although one may
be focusing on the factors pertaining to moral conduct, one will be
aware of the remaining factors and the role that they play.</p>
<p>The teaching on the ten wholesome courses of action expands the Path
factors in a way that may be applied by all human beings (these ten
factors are described as ‘factors leading to true humanity’ –
<em>manussa-dhamma</em>). It is evident in this teaching that moral conduct is
accompanied by mental and wisdom development. (The first seven factors
pertain to moral conduct; factors eight and nine pertain to
concentration; and the tenth factor pertains to wisdom).</p>
<p>The five precepts, however, which is considered the most basic form of
acceptable moral conduct, encompasses only the stage of <em>sīla</em>, not of
<em>samādhi</em> or <em>paññā</em>. This indicates that the five precepts alone are
inadequate for truly advancing on the Buddhist path. When one is unable
to develop the higher spiritual qualities, at the very least one should
abstain from wickedness and try not to seriously harm others. {721}</p>
<p>Having said this, the five precepts are not excluded from the unity of
spiritual factors (<em>dhamma-sāmaggī</em>). In those circumstances when it was
appropriate to distinguish moral conduct as a distinct category, the
Buddha would prepare a complementary teaching containing factors
pertaining to the mind (<em>citta</em>) and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). (Here, these
three factors are not placed together in a single group as they are in
the ten wholesome courses of action.) He would teach those laypeople who
began their spiritual practice by upholding the five precepts to
complete their training by developing the mind and wisdom, so that they
may become awakened disciples.</p>
<p>This alternative presentation of integrated spiritual factors is used as
a teaching specifically for householders and it usually contains four
factors: faith, virtuous conduct, generosity, and wisdom (occasionally
the fifth factor of learning is added). This group of factors is
mentioned very frequently in the Tipiṭaka; here is a concise summary of
this teaching:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>After mentioning the means by which one gains victory in this world (by
properly managing one’s home, domestic help, financial earnings, etc.,
which are matters pertaining to immediate benefits –
<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>), the Buddha speaks about the means by which one
gains victory in the world to come (pertaining to future benefits –
<em>samparāyikattha</em>):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Possessing four qualities, Visākhā, a woman practises for victory in
the next world and makes ready for the next world. What four?....</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>And how is a woman accomplished in faith (saddhā)?.... Here, a
woman is endowed with faith. She has conviction in the awakening
of the Tathāgata (tathāgatabodhi-saddhā) thus: ‘The Blessed One is
an arahant....’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And how is a woman accomplished in virtuous conduct (sīla)?....
Here, a woman abstains from the destruction of life ... from
taking what is not given ... from sexual misconduct ... from false
speech ... from spirits and intoxicants, the basis for
heedlessness....</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And how is a woman accomplished in generosity (cāga)?.... Here, a
woman dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of
miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in
relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and
sharing....</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And how is a woman accomplished in wisdom (paññā)?.... Here, a
woman is wise; she possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and
passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the
complete destruction of suffering....</p>
</li>

<p>The fifth factor, which is desirable but not imperative, is ‘learning’
(<em>suta</em>; learning by way of formal education, reading, listening, etc.),
which refers to acquiring the raw data for knowledge. If one develops
great learning (<em>bahussuta</em>), this is even more advantageous.</p>
<p>Many Buddhists are concerned only with moral conduct. They may be aware
of other aspects of the teachings, but their knowledge is often confused
and unsystematic, even though the Buddha clearly outlined a complete
spiritual development, of <em>sīla</em>, <em>samādhi</em>, and <em>paññā</em>. He reiterated
how householders should be endowed with faith (<em>saddhā</em>), moral conduct
(<em>sīla</em>; specifically the five precepts), learning (<em>suta</em>), generosity
(<em>cāga</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). When one reaches this unity of spiritual
factors at this level, the noble path (<em>ariya-magga</em>) is accessible for
cultivation.</p>
<p>The Pali term <em>sīla</em> has a very broad scope of meaning; it can be used
in very specific contexts or in a general sense. And as mentioned
earlier, it is important to be able to distinguish this term from the
term <em>vinaya</em>. {722}</p>
<p>Principles of Dhamma may be divided into the three factors of moral
conduct (<em>sīla</em>), concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).
Concentration and wisdom pertain exclusively to Dhamma, whereas moral
conduct may be divided into a principle of Dhamma and also into a
conventional disciplinary code (<em>vinaya</em>). <em>Vinaya</em> is one aspect of
<em>sīla</em> (see the section ‘<em>Sīla</em> on the Level of Dhamma &amp; <em>Sīla</em> on the
Level of Vinaya’ below). {723}</p>
<p>Following are some teachings by the Buddha summarizing basic moral
principles in relation to ordinary people and clarifying the meaning and
essence of the term <em>sīla</em>.</p>

<li>
<p>Right livelihood (<em>sammā-ājīva</em>): to relinquish wrong livelihood; to
earn one’s living righteously; this factor includes a perseverance
in maintaining an upright livelihood, for example by not leaving
matters in arrears (i.e. not allowing work to pile up and be
disorderly, not procrastinating, and not making half-hearted
effort). (See
Note <a href="#note-wrong-trade">Trades of Wrong Livelihood</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Buddha applied these essential guidelines of moral conduct to
ordinary people, describing basic principles of behaviour, which are
suitable for human beings to live together happily and to lead wholesome
lives, free from excessive conflict. These principles are referred to in
the Pali Canon as the five ‘training rules’ (<em>sikkhā-pada</em>), which were
later commonly referred to as the five precepts (<em>pañca-sīla</em>). Let us
review these precepts:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> {724}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To abstain from killing living creatures (<em>pāṇātipāta</em>);
essentially, this refers to conduct that is free from physical
oppression of other beings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from taking what is not freely given (<em>adinnādāna</em>); to
abstain from stealing; essentially, this refers to conduct that is
free from transgressing others in the context of material property
and possessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from sexual misconduct (<em>kāmesumicchācāra</em>); essentially,
this refers to conduct that is free from harming others in the
context of married partners and cherished individuals, from
transgressing sexual mores and traditions, from adultery, and from
sexual behaviour that damages a family’s reputation and
lineage.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from speaking falsehoods (<em>musā-vāda</em>); essentially, this
refers to conduct that is free from transgressing others by telling
lies or by speaking in order to take advantage or to cause harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from spirits, liquor, and intoxicants
(<em>surāmerayamajja</em>), which are a basis for heedlessness;
essentially, this refers to conduct that is free from recklessness
and intoxication due to the use of addictive substances that impair
mindfulness and clear comprehension.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Standard definitions of the five precepts (along with similar moral
precepts) have been handed down from scholars and commentators to later
generations. To begin with, let us look at some teachings by the Buddha
on this subject:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>I will teach you, householders, a Dhamma exposition applicable to
oneself....</p>
<p>Here, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘I am one who
wishes to live, who does not wish to die; I cherish happiness and am
averse to suffering. Since I am one who wishes to live ... and am
averse to suffering, if someone were to take my life, that would not
be pleasing and agreeable to me. Now if I were to take the life of
another – of one who wishes to live, who does not wish to die, who
cherishes happiness and is averse to suffering – that would not be
pleasing and agreeable to the other either. What is displeasing and
disagreeable to me is displeasing and disagreeable to the other too.
How can I inflict upon another what is displeasing and disagreeable to
me?’ Having reflected thus, he himself abstains from the destruction
of life, exhorts others to abstain from the destruction of life, and
speaks in praise of abstinence from the destruction of life. Thus this
bodily conduct of his is purified in three respects.</p>
<p>Again, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were
to take from me what I have not given, that is, to commit theft, that
would not be pleasing and agreeable to me. Now if I were to take from
another what he has not given, that is, to commit theft, that would
not be pleasing and agreeable to the other either....’</p>
<p>Again, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were
to commit adultery with my wife, that would not be pleasing and
agreeable to me. Now if I were to commit adultery with the wife of
another, that would not be pleasing and agreeable to the other
either....’</p>
<p>Again, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were
to damage my welfare with false speech, that would not be pleasing and
agreeable to me. Now if I were to damage the welfare of another with
false speech, that would not be pleasing and agreeable to the other
either....’ {375}</p>
<p>Again, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were
to instigate a split between me and my friends by divisive speech,
that would not be pleasing and agreeable to me. Now if I were to
instigate a split between another and his friends by divisive speech,
that would not be pleasing and agreeable to the other either....’</p>
<p>Again, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were
to address me with harsh speech, that would not be pleasing and
agreeable to me. Now if I were to address another with harsh speech,
that would not be pleasing and agreeable to the other either....’</p>
<p>Again, householders, a noble disciple reflects thus: ‘If someone were
to address me with frivolous speech and idle chatter, that would not
be pleasing and agreeable to me. Now if I were to address another with
frivolous speech and idle chatter, that would not be pleasing and
agreeable to the other either. What is displeasing and disagreeable to
me is displeasing and disagreeable to the other too. How can I inflict
upon another what is displeasing and disagreeable to me?’ Having
reflected thus, he himself abstains from idle chatter, exhorts others
to abstain from idle chatter, and speaks in praise of abstinence from
idle chatter. Thus this verbal conduct of his is purified in three
respects.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 353-5.</em></p>
<p>‘Now what do you think, monks, have you ever seen or heard of the
following: “This man has abandoned the taking of life, he is one who
abstains from the taking of life; and kings seize him and execute him,
imprison him, banish him, or impose a punishment on him for this
reason”?’</p>
<p>‘No, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>‘Good, monks. I too have never seen or heard of the following.... But
if they announce some evil deed as this: “This man has caused the
death of a woman or man”, then kings, because he has taken life, seize
him and execute, imprison, banish, or impose a punishment on him –
has such a thing been seen or heard of by you?’</p>
<p>‘Lord, this thing has been both seen and heard of by us, and we shall
hear of it again.’</p>
<p>‘What do you think, monks, have you ever seen or heard of the
following: “This man has abandoned the taking of what is not given, he
is one who abstains from taking what is not given ... from sexual
misconduct ... from false speech ... from spirits and intoxicants that
are a basis for heedlessness; and kings seize him and execute him,
imprison him, banish him, or impose a punishment on him for abstaining
from taking what is not given ... from sexual misconduct ... from
speaking falsely ... from [indulging in] spirits and intoxicants”?’</p>
<p>‘No, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>‘Good, monks. I too have never seen or heard of the following.... But
if they announce some evil deed as this: “This man has stolen
something from a village or a forest”.... “This man violated the wives
and daughters of others”.... “This man has brought to ruin a
householder or a householder’s son with false speech”.... “This man is
given over to drinking wines and spirits and has killed a woman or
man”.... “This man is given over to drinking wines and spirits and has
stolen something from a village or a forest” ... “This man is given
over to drinking wines and spirits and has violated the wives and
daughters of others” ... “This man is given over to drinking wines and
spirits and has brought to ruin a householder or a householder’s son
with false speech; then kings, because he has stolen ... he has
committed sexual misconduct ... he has spoken falsely ... he has
[indulged in] wines and spirits; kings seize him and execute,
imprison, banish, or impose a punishment on him” – has such a thing
been seen or heard of by you?’ {726}</p>
<p>‘Lord, this thing has been both seen and heard of by us, and we shall
hear of it again.’</p>
<p><em>A. III. 208-209.</em></p>

</div>
<p>Almost all serious crime stems from a transgression of the five
precepts. In societies containing widespread killing, mutual animosity,
persecution, sexual misconduct, murder, theft, rape, deceit, abuse of
intoxicants and addictive drugs, along with the resulting problems and
casualties of drug and alcohol abuse, human life and people’s
possessions are not safe. Wherever people go they experience anxiety and
fear. When people meet, instead of feeling relaxed and at ease, they
become mistrustful of one another. People’s mental health deteriorates
and it is difficult for people to develop spiritual power and virtue.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Trades of Wrong Livelihood</span><a id="note-wrong-trade"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At A. III. 209 there is a teaching by the Buddha on the five kinds of
business a lay disciple should abstain from (<em>akaraṇīya-vaṇijjā</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>trade in arms (’instruments of death’ – <em>sattha-vaṇijjā</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trade in human beings (<em>satta-vaṇijjā</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trade in the flesh of animals (<em>maṁsa-vaṇijjā</em>) – the
commentaries say this refers to raising animals for slaughter;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trade in intoxicants (<em>majja-vaṇijjā</em>), including other addictive
drugs besides alcohol that lead to heedlessness; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trade in poisons (<em>visava-vaṇijjā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the commentaries these five kinds of business are referred to as
‘wrong business’ (<em>micchā-vaṇijjā</em>) – DA. I. 235; MA. I. 136 – or as
‘unrighteous business’ (<em>adhamma-vaṇijjā</em>) – SnA. I. 379.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Such a society is not a supportive environment for cultivating spiritual
virtue because people are preoccupied with resolving social conflict and
chaos, which often increases in intensity.</p>
<p>For this reason, an absence of an adherence to the five precepts is a
measuring stick to determine the level of social decay. The keeping of
the five precepts marks the behaviour and way of life that is opposite
to the unwholesome actions listed above.</p>
<p>Keeping the five precepts is the most basic criterion for determining
human moral conduct; to keep these precepts preserves a healthy social
environment and acts as a foundation for a virtuous way of life and for
greater spiritual development.</p>
<p>For convenience, the commentators compiled a list of criteria for
determining what actions constitute a transgression of each of the five
precepts, establishing the ‘necessary conditions’ (<em>sambhāra</em>) or
‘factors’ (<em>aṅga</em>) of transgression. One has transgressed (or ‘broken’)
a precept when one fulfils all the necessary conditions, as
follows:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transgression of the first precept, killing living creatures,
contains five factors: (1) the creature (person or animal) possesses
life; (2) one knows that the creature is alive; (3) there is an
intention to kill; (4) there is an effort to kill; (5) the creature
dies as a consequence of that effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgression of the second precept, stealing, contains five
factors: (1) the object is considered a personal possession by
someone else; (2) one knows that the other person considers the
object a personal possession; (3) there is an intention to
steal; (4) there is an effort to steal; (5) the theft is successful
through that effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgression of the third precept, sexual misconduct, contains four
factors: (1) there is a man or a woman who should not be violated
(<em>agamanīya-vatthu</em>);<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup> (2) there is an intention to have sexual
intercourse; (3) there is an effort to have intercourse; (4) ‘there
is a way through’: there is contact of the sexual organs. {727}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgression of the fourth precept, false speech, contains four
factors: (1) the speech is untrue; (2) there is an intention to
speak falsely; (3) there is an effort resulting from that
intention; (4) another person comprehends that which has been
spoken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transgression of the fifth precept, consuming liquor, spirits, and
intoxicants, contains four factors: (1) the substance is an
intoxicant; (2) there is a desire to consume the substance; (3)
there is an effort resulting from that desire; (4) the substance is
swallowed and passes the person’s throat.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In regard to the first precept, although the scriptures focus primarily
on not killing human beings (as in the quotes by the Buddha above),
animals too cherish life, delight in happiness, are averse to pain, and
are companions in this world of birth, old-age, sickness, and death, and
they too should not be oppressed. The first precept thus includes
animals in the definition of living creatures. Granted, the scriptures
claim that, kammically,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup> killing animals is of a less serious
consequence than killing human beings.</p>
<p>In regard to this matter, the commentaries offer principles for judging
the severity of ill-effects resulting from transgressing the five
precepts, based on various criteria.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Later generations of Buddhist monastic scholars compiled a group of
factors paired with the five precepts to be applied by Buddhist
laypeople in tandem with the precepts. These factors are known as the
‘five virtues’ (<em>pañca-dhamma</em>) or the ‘five beautiful qualities’
(<em>pañcakalyāṇa-dhamma</em>).</p>
<p>In essence, they correspond to the factors of the ‘wholesome courses of
action’ (<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>), with some variation depending on the
breadth of definition and application. {728}</p>
<p>These five factors follow the order of the five precepts as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>) and compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right-livelihood (<em>sammā-ājīva</em>); some scholars substitute or
include generosity (<em>dāna</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense restraint (<em>kāma-saṁvara</em>): to possess self-control in regard
to sense impressions and sense desires, and to not allow these to
lead to immoral behaviour. (Some scholars substitute
<em>sadāra-santosa</em>: ‘contentment with one’s spouse’.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honesty (<em>sacca</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) and clear comprehension (<em>sampajañña</em>); some
scholars substitute ‘heedfulness’ (<em>appamāda</em>), which has
essentially the same meaning.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Sadāra-santosa</em>, which stands in opposition to sexual misconduct,
literally translates as ‘contentment with one’s wife’, but at heart it
means ‘contentment with one’s spouse’. From a broad perspective, this
factor is based on mutual agreement and consent, and also on conformity
with social conventions and rules: to not mistreat or be unfaithful to
one’s spouse, to not act against the consent of the other person
involved, and to not violate someone who is ‘off limits’ – someone who
is under the authority or care of someone else.</p>
<p>Although this factor does not firmly stipulate a single spouse in
contrast to numerous spouses, the Buddhist texts favour and commend
monogamy, for it leads to long-lasting mutual love and respect, and to a
stable family in which the children feel secure and at ease.</p>
<p>The model couple in the suttas for such a monogamous relationship are
the noble disciples Nakulapitā and Nakulamātā. They were both
stream-enterers and are considered the foremost lay-disciples
(<em>etadagga</em>) in respect to being in a close relationship to the Buddha.
They had a deep love, devotion and loyalty to one another, and were
equally matched in spiritual virtues, to the point that they expressed a
wish to meet not only in this lifetime but in future lifetimes. Here are
the recorded words of Nakulapitā:</p>
<p>Lord, ever since the young housewife Nakulamātā was brought home to me
when I was still young, I have never been aware of acting unfaithfully
towards her even in my thoughts, still less in my deeds. Lord, our wish
is to be together so long as this life lasts and in the future life as
well.</p>
<p>Nakulamātā uttered the same words.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>The texts classify contentment with one’s spouse as a form of ‘divine
conduct’ (<em>brahmacariya</em>), which shows how highly praised this quality
is in the Buddhist teachings. The commentators state that such pure
conduct is a cause for not dying young, as in this passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>We are not unfaithful to our wives and our wives are not unfaithful to
us. We practise chastity (<em>brahmacariya</em>) in regards to other women
apart from our wives. Therefore, none of us has died while still
young.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup> {729}</p>
<p><em>DA. I. 178; MA. II. 42; ItA. I. 108; SnA. I. 43.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>To sum up, the following verses describe basic moral conduct in a
nutshell:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A person who is composed in body, speech and mind, who does not
perform any evil acts, who does not utter senseless, self-serving
speech, such a one is called a virtuous person.</p>
<p><em>J. V. 146.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a class="header" href="#general-principles-on-right-livelihood" id="general-principles-on-right-livelihood">General Principles on Right Livelihood</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, right livelihood is an aspect of <em>sīla</em> that often
gets overlooked. Although only a brief summary will be presented here,
the teachings on right livelihood are very meaningful and deserve a
thorough investigation. Following are some general principles on this
subject:</p>
<p>Buddhism focuses on the basic requirements human beings have for
existence, i.e. the main purpose of earning a livelihood is to ensure
that every individual in society has an adequate amount of the four
requisites to sustain life. The Buddhist teachings give precedence to
human beings; they do not emphasize an abundance of material wealth,
which would be to give precedence to material possessions.</p>
<p>This principle of sufficiency is included in the Buddhist teachings on
proper governance. One of the responsibilities of a king, for example,
is to distribute wealth to the poor, to ensure that there are no
impoverished, destitute people in the land.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup> The success of a
ruler’s work or of a government’s economic policies should thus be
measured not by a full treasury or abundant wealth but rather by the
absence of poverty in society.</p>
<p>In the case that these basic requirements have been met, the scriptures
do not pass judgement on how much wealth a person possesses or whether
there is an equal distribution of wealth in society, because these
matters are connected to other factors, for example:</p>
<p>It is not a goal in itself to possess an adequate amount of the four
requisites to sustain life, or even to possess abundant material wealth,
because the search for and acquisition of wealth is part of the stage of
developing virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>): the acquisition of wealth is a
means for reaching a higher goal. It is a foundation for developing the
mind and cultivating wisdom in order to lead a wholesome life and to
experience more refined forms of happiness.</p>
<p>People differ in disposition and aptitude. Some people are content with
a minimum degree of material wealth required to sustain life and focus
primarily on developing higher spiritual qualities. Other people,
however, are not yet prepared for these higher stages and are more
dependent on material things, which is acceptable if they are not
involved in harming others.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are some people whose disposition and aptitude it is to
assist others by sharing material wealth; their wealth is thus of
benefit to others.</p>
<p>The meaning of the term ‘right livelihood’ is not restricted to the
application of one’s labour for producing goods or for acquiring the
requisites of life through righteous means. This term also includes a
fulfilment of personal responsibilities: a proper conduct or way of
life, which makes a person worthy of receiving these requisites. For
example, the upholding by the bhikkhus of the ‘qualities of a monk’
(<em>samaṇa-dhamma</em>) and the consequent receiving of the four requisites
offered by the lay community is right livelihood of a bhikkhu.
Similarly, children behaving well and acting in a way worthy of the care
bestowed on them by their parents can be considered the ‘right
livelihood’ of a child.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in determining the value of labour, instead of focusing
merely on the production of goods for gratifying people’s needs and
desires – as it may be ambiguous whether these needs are governed by
greed or are connected to true requirements for life – the way of
Dhamma focuses on the fruits of labour that either support a person’s
life and the wellbeing of society or else act in a detrimental way.
{734}</p>
<p>From what has been said so far, there are two related matters for
consideration:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> In the Buddhist teachings, the relationship between a person’s
profession (or work) and a person’s material income is twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For ordinary people, the exertion of labour is directly related to
their profession: one works in order to receive some monetary or
material gain to help support one’s life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For monks or renunciants (<em>samaṇa</em>), the exertion of labour is
independent of employment in the general sense. The intention of a
renunciant to put forth effort or to work is not to receive some
material gain but rather to advance in the Dhamma or to uphold the
Dhamma. If a monk diverts his efforts from his proper
responsibilities in order to specifically seek out the four
requisites, this is considered ‘wrong livelihood’ (<em>micchā-ājīva</em>).
Likewise, if he acts in order to profit materially, by soliciting
the requisites in a way that runs counter to the wishes of the
donor, this is considered an impure livelihood.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from obvious examples of wrong livelihood – of deception,
flattery, hinting, intimidation, and pursuing gain with gain<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup> –
making a living by serving others, say by running errands, engaging in
various arts like choosing auspicious occasions, making prophesies, and
practising medicine, are also classified as ‘wrong livelihood’ for
bhikkhus.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>If a monk who is not ill asks for food – fine food, hard food, or even
boiled rice – for himself and eats it, this behaviour is faulty as
regards the vocation of a monk.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup> To make the Dhamma into some form
of commodity is wrong according to the renunciant’s code of ethics.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup>
Giving a Dhamma talk with the thought that the listeners may be pleased
and one may thus receive some form of reward is an ‘impure’ Dhamma
talk.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn30">30</a></sup> Even an act of giving that resembles a payment or recompense
is inappropriate, as is evident in the following occasion involving the
Buddha:</p>
<p>At one time the Buddha was walking for alms and stopped at the edge of a
field belonging to a brahman. The brahman said: ‘I plough and sow, and
having ploughed and sown, I eat.’ The Buddha replied: ‘I too, brahman,
plough and sow; and having ploughed and sown, I eat.’ The brahman was
perplexed and there followed a series of questions and answers spoken in
verse; the Buddha concluded by saying that his ploughing and sowing
bears the fruit of ‘immortality’ (<em>amata</em>: the ‘deathless’). The brahman
applauded this reply and with faith offered some food to the Buddha. The
Buddha refused this food saying it would be inappropriate to eat food
acquired through chanting verses.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>A pure and righteous acquisition of the four requisites for bhikkhus
occurs when laypeople recognize the value of the Dhamma and see the
necessity of assisting those individuals whose duty it is to uphold the
Dhamma. The laypeople are made aware of the monks’ requirement for food
when the monks walk in a composed manner on almsround; the laity then
offer food from their own initiative. The effect of this generosity is
that the donors purify, brighten, and elevate their minds, by reflecting
on how they have performed a virtuous deed of supporting those
individuals who practise the Dhamma and of participating themselves in
upholding the Dhamma. In short, they make merit or receive blessings.
{735}</p>
<p>The monks who receive these offerings are guided by the principles of
conduct dealing with the four requisites which state that a monk should
be contented with little and know moderation in regard to the
requisites. This is in contrast to other responsibilities of a monk, for
example teaching and advising, which should be performed as much as is
possible with the sole aim of benefiting those who receive the
teachings.</p>
<p>The principle of eating just enough to sustain the body while at the
same time performing as much work as possible is compatible for a
renunciant, for whom the exertion of effort is completely separate from
the material gains of his or her livelihood. A monk cannot demand
special rights or privileges by appealing to the amount of work he
performs. When renunciants practise according to this principle, the
external social system does not dictate their lives.</p>
<p>These principles mentioned above have the significant objective of
creating a lifestyle that is free from all external social systems, or
to create an independent community whose duty it is to realize and
uphold the truth and whose members wish for the complete spiritual
purification of all human beings.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> An honest examination reveals that much of human labour in the
area of economic production, both in terms of material goods and the
service industry, does not truly benefit human life and society. Apart
from obvious destructive activity, like producing weapons or narcotics,
there are businesses that destroy the natural environment, demean human
dignity, or damage the quality of people’s minds, while others are
dedicated solely to preventing and solving the consequences of harmful
actions. In large part, these kinds of labour are a waste of effort and
end up being destructive.</p>
<p>Growth in many of these industries requires people to devote a great
deal of energy and capital in order to prevent and solve the destructive
effects resulting from the production itself. In contrast, labour that
truly benefits human beings and society does not necessarily need to be
part of the ordinary market economy, as can be seen in an exemplary life
in harmony with Dhamma, which promotes human virtue and wisdom.</p>
<p>Even from the perspective of output or yield, personal virtue is
occasionally more valuable than the fruits of physical labour: for
example, a monk may be meditating in a forest without making any
explicit effort to protect the forest, but the forest rangers may say
that he is more effective in preserving the forest than all of their
projects or efforts combined.</p>
<p>In terms of true wellbeing and happiness of human beings, looking only
at the value of production and consumption is not enough; it is
necessary to also look at the value of not producing and not consuming.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Dhamma, a person who does not produce anything
within the sphere of the market economy, yet consumes the world’s
resources in a prudent fashion and has a healthy relationship to the
natural environment, is better than a person who produces things that
are destructive and consumes the world’s resources in a wasteful manner.
It appears, however, that most economic ideologies praise the latter
person who produces and consumes much (who is destructive) more than the
former person who produces and consumes little (who is less
destructive).</p>
<p>One should ask whether it is a fair assessment to refer only to the act
of production without considering the amount of waste resulting from
consumption or without reflecting on how production truly benefits human
beings.</p>
<p>The field of economics is often only interested in statistics, numbers,
and monetary growth. Although economics is considered a branch of
science, many economic theories and ideologies are limited, inadequate,
and incomplete when it comes to solving the economic problems of human
beings, who exist above any particular branch of abstract scientific
knowledge. {736} Indeed, admitting that mere numerical calculations and
tallies cannot suffice in solving human problems would act for the
benefit and integrity of the field of economics.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Buddhist teachings are not really interested in
how much wealth a person possesses, and the value of a person is not
determined by how much money he or she has. Material wealth is viewed
simply as a stepping stone to a higher goal rather than as a goal in
itself, and the value of money is linked to the practice for reaching
this higher goal.</p>
<p>The focus in Buddhism is on two stages: the methods by which wealth is
acquired and the way that acquired wealth is subsequently used. Buddhism
does not emphasize possessing wealth but rather emphasizes the search
for and the spending of wealth. To merely accumulate money for no
particular purpose is considered as reprehensible as acquiring money in
immoral ways or spending money in harmful ways.</p>
<p>There are thus three basic vices in regard to material wealth:
unrighteous acquisition of wealth, possession of wealth without using it
for one’s true advantage, and the spending of wealth in harmful ways.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although a person may acquire wealth righteously and spend
money in beneficial ways, this behaviour does not yet count as complete
in regard to a proper relationship to material wealth. This is because
the Buddhist teachings emphasize wisdom and the quality of one’s mind. A
person’s relationship towards material wealth must include ‘liberating
wisdom’ (<em>nissaraṇa-paññā</em>).</p>
<p>This liberating wisdom implies that one truly understands the value, the
benefits, and the limitations of wealth, and one recognizes how wealth
has the potential to be either helpful or harmful. Rather than be
enslaved by wealth, one should be the master of wealth, by recognizing
that wealth should serve people and act as a means for developing
goodness, reducing suffering, and increasing true happiness. Wealth
should not be a cause for adding to personal distress, corrupting
people’s minds, damaging human dignity, or creating divisions among
people.</p>
<p>The Buddha described ten different kinds of laypeople (<em>kāmabhogī</em>;
‘those who enjoy sensual pleasures’), the tenth of which he described as
supreme. Among the characteristics of these most excellent laypeople,
one can see the way of dealing with money that accords with Dhamma,
which can be summarized as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Acquisition: to seek wealth in righteous ways, without abusing or
harming others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expenditure (this stage also includes both saving money and living
in moderation):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To provide for one’s happiness (along with the happiness of
those for whom one is responsible).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be charitable; to share one’s wealth with others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To use one’s wealth for meritorious purposes (including for
promulgating and promoting the Dhamma).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liberating wisdom: to not be heedless with one’s wealth; to apply
wisdom when spending money; to know the advantages and dangers of
wealth; to not be enslaved by money; to rely on money in order to
find opportunities for spiritual development.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Buddha gave the following teaching about people’s relationship to
wealth:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these three persons found existing in the world. What
three?</p>
<p>The blind, the one-eyed, the two-eyed. {737}</p>
<p>And how is a person blind? Here some person does not possess the eye
that helps to acquire unacquired wealth or make acquired wealth
increase, and he does not possess the eye that helps to distinguish
between skilful and unskilful things ... between harmful and harmless
things ... between base and refined things ... between things
comparable to either bright or dark objects. This person is called
‘blind’.</p>
<p>And how is a person one-eyed? Here some person possesses the eye that
helps to acquire unacquired wealth or make acquired wealth increase,
but he does not possess the eye that helps to distinguish between
skilful and unskilful things ... between harmful and harmless things
... between base and refined things ... between things comparable to
either bright or dark objects. This person is called ‘one-eyed’.</p>
<p>And how is a person two-eyed? Here some person possesses the eye that
helps to acquire unacquired wealth or make acquired wealth increase,
and he also possesses the eye that helps to distinguish between
skilful and unskilful things ... between harmful and harmless things
... between base and refined things ... between things comparable to
either bright or dark objects. This person is called ‘two-eyed’.</p>
<p>The blind man, with eyes impaired, experiences twofold misfortune: he
possesses no such wealth, nor does he perform good deeds.</p>
<p>Another, who is called ‘one-eyed’, searches merely for wealth through
righteous or unrighteous means, even through theft, trickery, and
deceit.</p>
<p>He takes pleasure in sensuality, clever at accumulating wealth; but
departing here the ‘one-eyed’ experiences torment in hell.</p>
<p>Best of all is the person called ‘two-eyed’; he distributes his
hard-earned wealth rightly won, is generous, with noble intent,
unwavering; he reaches a favourable destination, free from sorrow.</p>
<p>One should steer clear from the blind and the one-eyed, and associate
only with the noble, two-eyed person.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 128-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha criticized the hoarding of material wealth without it being
used for any beneficial purposes. For instance, on one occasion King
Pasenadi of Kosala visited the Buddha. The Buddha asked why the king was
out during the day. King Pasenadi told the Buddha that a householder who
was a millionaire had recently died in the capital city and because this
man had no heir the king had gone to collect his treasure and transport
it to the palace.</p>
<p>The king went on to say that amongst this treasure there were eight
million gold coins, not to mention the amount of silver. And yet when
this man was alive he ate only grits with sour gruel, wore a three-piece
rough garment, and went about in a dilapidated little cart with a leaf
awning. The Buddha replied:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>So it is, great king! When an inferior man gains abundant wealth, he
does not make himself happy and pleased, nor does he make his mother
and father ... his wife and children ... his servants, workers, and
employees ... his friends and colleagues happy and pleased; nor does
he establish an offering for ascetics and brahmans, one bearing noble
fruit, generating virtuous states of mind, resulting in happiness,
conducive to heaven. {738}</p>
<p>Because his wealth is not being used properly, kings confiscate it, or
thieves steal it, or fire consumes it, or water carries it away, or
displeasing heirs take it. Such being the case, that wealth, not being
used properly, goes to waste, not to utilization. This is similar to a
lotus pond in a place uninhabited by human beings – although it has
clear, cool, fresh, and clean water, with good fords, delightful; but
no people would take that water, or drink it, or bathe in it, or use
it for any purpose.</p>
<p>But when a superior man gains abundant wealth, he makes himself happy
and pleased, he makes his mother and father ... his wife and children
... his servants, workers, and employees ... his friends and
colleagues happy and pleased; and he establishes an offering for
ascetics and brahmans, one bearing noble fruit, generating virtuous
states of mind, resulting in happiness, conducive to heaven.</p>
<p>Because his wealth is being used properly, kings do not confiscate it,
thieves cannot steal it, fire does not consume it, water does not
carry it away, and unloved heirs cannot take it. Such being the case,
that wealth, being used properly, goes to utilization, not to waste.
This is similar to a lotus pond in a place not far from a village or a
town, with clear, cool, fresh, and clean water, with good fords,
delightful; and people would take that water, and drink it, and bathe
in it, and use it for their purposes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>As cool water in a desolate place<br />
Is forsaken without being drunk,<br />
So when a scoundrel acquires wealth<br />
He neither enjoys it nor shares it.<br />
But when the wise man obtains wealth<br />
He utilizes it and does his duty.<br />
Having supported his kin, free from blame,<br />
That noble man goes to a heavenly state.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>S. I. 89-91.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>And on a similar occasion:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>So it is, great king! Few are those people in the world who, when they
obtain great wealth, do not become intoxicated and negligent,
captivated by sensual pleasures, and mistreat other beings. Far more
numerous are those people in the world who, when they obtain great
wealth, become intoxicated and negligent, captivated by sensual
pleasures, and mistreat other beings.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 74.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A person who accumulates wealth but does not utilize or share it is
compared to the <em>mayhaka</em> bird, which sits in a fig tree full of ripe
fruit and cries, <em>mayhaṃ, mayhaṃ</em> (from the Pali meaning ‘mine, mine’).
When flocks of other birds come to peck at the fruit and fly off again,
the <em>mayhaka</em> bird remains babbling away.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>There are many stories in the scriptures criticizing stingy people who
keep money to themselves and do not use it to help others. These stories
often recount a change of mind for wealthy, miserly merchants. They
provide insightful teachings on the Buddhist view on proper ownership
and the use of wealth.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn35">35</a></sup> {739}</p>

sīlena bhogasampadā, sīlena nibbutiṃ</em>.... This verse can be translated
as: ‘By way of virtuous conduct, one goes to heaven, one achieves an
abundance of wealth, one reaches Nibbāna....’</p>
<p>The pertinent clause here is that referring to an abundance of wealth:
moral conduct leads to wealth and thus to a healthy economy. Although
this verse was composed in later years and appears neither in the
Tipiṭaka nor in the commentaries and sub-commentaries, because of its
traditional importance, it is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The chief principle of moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>) is that it establishes a
stable basis and prepares a disciplined environment, in order that one
may successfully engage in various essential activities.</p>
<p>In relation to the economy, when people are established in moral
conduct, and there is an absence of crime and a reduction of danger to
human life or personal possessions, people can move about safely.
Consequently, when building factories, engaging in trade, and travelling
about, either in the city or the country, during the day or at night,
people feel secure and at ease. Bosses and their employees relate to one
another with kindness and sincerity. The state bureaucracy is honest,
efficient, and trustworthy. Communication between people, both locally
and internationally, is smooth and easy, and production and commerce
proceeds unhindered. This is how moral conduct prepares a foundation for
economic prosperity.</p>
<p>Once a nation is stable and its citizens feel secure, one can shift
one’s focus to individual people. Here, we need not examine the obvious
harmful effects of immoral behaviour, for instance licentiousness,
theft, deceit, and alcoholism. When people determine to earn their
living in a virtuous, upright manner, and they are devoted to such an
honest pursuit, they will no longer act or think in immoral,
unscrupulous ways. They will not be detracted even by thoughts of
unexpected windfalls, let alone by acquiring things through dishonest
means.</p>
<p>When one’s mind is truly intent on one’s work, muddled or distracted
thoughts cease. This is the beginning of concentration. When one is
focused and committed to one’s work and activities, one engages with
such considerations as: ‘How should I begin?’ ‘What should I do?’ ‘How
should I proceed to achieve my goal?’ ‘What obstacles am I likely to
face?’ ‘How should I solve these problems?’ ‘With whom should I
associate?’ ‘Whom should I consult?’ This is how moral conduct affects
the mind; concentration and wisdom then take over as the guiding
factors. The four paths to success (<em>iddhipāda</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn37">37</a></sup> arise in turn and
one can be assured of accomplishment and success.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the function of moral conduct is to establish a stable
foundation for people to confidently engage in further spiritual
practice. If one lacks moral discipline, one will have a weak foundation
and an unsupportive environment. Without moral integrity, one cannot
truly begin on the spiritual path. If one tries to begin, one will be
shaky and unsteady. On the contrary, when people’s surroundings are
favourable and their foundation stable, they are able to truly engage
with their work; they will be endowed with concentration.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a passage summarizing the teaching for householders,
the Buddha uttered a verse acting as a constant principle in regard to
this subject of moral conduct:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Diligent in one’s work, heedful, clever at managing one’s affairs.
{740}</p>
<p><em>Uṭṭhātā kammadheyyesu appamatto vidhānavā.</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn38">38</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. IV. 284, 289, 322, 324-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>One may say that this verse epitomizes the Buddhist principle towards
work. Work begins as a consequence of diligence (represented in Pali by
the term <em>uṭṭhāna</em>, which may also be translated as ‘rising to one’s
feet’, ‘non-complacency’, ‘increase of wealth’, or ‘increased
prosperity’). When one is diligent and industrious, one’s work advances,
leading to completion and accomplishment.</p>
<p>The Buddha emphasized diligence not only as a factor leading to success,
but also as a recollection for self-esteem and joy in regard to one’s
work. A frequent teaching he gave to householders in this context is:
‘One has acquired wealth by perseverance, amassed by the strength of
one’s arms, earned by the sweat of one’s brow, righteous wealth
righteously gained.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>Diligence also leads to self-development and to self-improvement,
because an engagement with work compel’s one to grow in many areas of
one’s life, to pass beyond obstacles, and to reach success.</p>
<p>Diligence on its own, however, is insufficient; one must also be endowed
with heedfulness (<em>appamāda</em>). If one is diligent and energetic, but one
acts in an untimely, inopportune way, or if one acts out of place or out
of step, putting forth effort where it is inappropriate, and desisting
from effort where it is due, one is likely to fail. Heedfulness here
refers to mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), which steps forward and functions in
tandem with effort (<em>viriya</em>). One is vigilant and alert, abreast of
circumstances as they unfold and unperturbed by negative situations. One
acts immediately when this is called for, and one is fully prepared to
protect what is valuable and to deal with unfinished business. One does
not miss a suitable opportunity when the time is ripe. One is not
negligent; one keeps to the principle: ‘Prepare well for the future; do
not allow unfinished business to cause distress in times of
crisis.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn40">40</a></sup></p>
<p>When supported by heedfulness, effort (<em>viriya</em>) is fully equipped and
functions in the following ways: (a) it prevents damage and loss; (2) it
solves problems and eliminates negative or dangerous situations; (3) it
enables and supports wholesome actions; and (4) it acts as a protective
force, say by protecting one’s virtuous qualities, upholding one’s
dignity, and enhancing one’s spiritual practice, culminating in
spiritual perfection.</p>
<p>The third clause in the verse above – ‘clever at managing one’s
affairs’ – refers to wisdom, which leads to a correct application of
diligence and enables heedfulness to truly bear fruit. In sum, wisdom
understands the principles involved in work. In particular, one is
endowed with the seven qualities of a virtuous person
(<em>sappurisa-dhamma</em>), which include such factors as: to know the origin
and cause of things; to know the objective and results of things; to
know oneself; to know moderation; to know the proper time; and to know
other people, to know one’s community, and to know one’s society, e.g.:
to be able to select the right people for a specific job, to know the
needs and desires of specific groups of people, etc.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>The Buddha frequently emphasized this clever management of affairs, both
in teachings to the monastic community (using the expression: <em>alaṃ
saṁvidhātuṃ</em> – ‘able at managing one’s affairs’), and in particular to
householders, who are responsible for activities within the wider
society. In regard to looking after a household, the Buddha taught this
principle: ‘A householder ... should be charitable and clever at
managing his affairs (<em>vidhānavanta</em>).’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn42">42</a></sup></p>
<p>In this context, there are many guiding principles in the scriptures for
people who work in government service, for example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>One endowed with discriminative discernment (<em>vicāraṇa-paññā</em>),
accomplished in awakened intelligence (<em>buddhi-paññā</em>), clever at
managing his affairs, knowing the proper time and occasion, is suited
to carry out government service. One diligent in his work,
circumspect, with keen insight, skilled at managing his affairs, is
suited to carry out government service.</p>
<p><em>J. VI. 296-7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>To sum up, moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>) encompasses those things that are
connected to human activities and to human co-existence. One may say
that moral conduct is a matter of preparing a suitable environment and
society, in order that people can fully devote themselves to the
cultivation of the mind and of wisdom. {741}</p>
<p>The following scriptural passages reveal Buddhist principles of right
livelihood for laypeople, describing the acquisition of wealth, the
spending of wealth, and the happiness that is derived from a just
livelihood.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-search-for-and-protection-of-wealth" id="the-search-for-and-protection-of-wealth">The Search for and Protection of Wealth</a></h3>
<p>At one time the brahman Ujjaya visited the Buddha and said that he would
soon be travelling on a long journey. He asked the Buddha to give a
teaching that would be conducive to both present and future wellbeing.
The Buddha replied:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>These four things, brahman, are conducive to present happiness and
wellbeing: the fulfilment of perseverance (<em>uṭṭhāna-sampadā</em>), the
fulfilment of protection (<em>ārakkha-sampadā</em>), association with
virtuous people (<em>kalyāṇa-mittatā</em>), and balanced livelihood
(<em>samajīvitā</em>).</p>
<p>What is the fulfilment of perseverance? Here a clansman earns his
living with diligence, either in agriculture, or commerce, or tending
livestock, or military service, or civil service, or some form of
craft. He is industrious and skilled, not negligent, possessed of
investigative acumen, familiar with the procedures of that work, able
to arrange and carry out that job. This is called fulfilment of
perseverance.</p>
<p>And what is fulfilment of protection? Here a clansman possesses wealth
acquired by hard work, collected by the strength of his arms, earned
by the sweat of his brow, justly obtained in a rightful manner. He
manages, protects, and watches over that wealth, thinking: ‘Now how
can I arrange it so that kings do not confiscate this wealth, that
thieves do not steal it, that fire does not consume it, that water
does not carry it away, and that displeasing heirs do not take it.’
This is called the fulfilment of protection.</p>
<p>And what is association with virtuous people? Here, in whichever town
or village a clansman dwells, he consorts, converses, and consults
with householders, householders’ sons, young men who act as
dignitaries, and old men who act as elders, who are endowed with
faith, moral conduct, generosity, and wisdom. He emulates the
accomplishment of faith in those who are endowed with faith, he
emulates the accomplishment of moral conduct in those who are endowed
with moral conduct, he emulates the accomplishment of generosity in
those who are endowed with generosity, and he emulates the
accomplishment of wisdom in those who are endowed with wisdom. This is
called association with virtuous people.</p>
<p>And what is balanced livelihood? Here, a clansman earns his living
with moderation, living neither too extravagantly nor overly
hard-pressed. He knows how wealth increases and how wealth shrinks,
thinking: ‘Acting in this way income will exceed my expenses, and
expenses will not surpass my income’ – just as a person who carries
scales or whose apprentice knows on holding up the balance that this
much [weight] is deficient and this much is excessive.... If this
clansman earns a small income but lives lavishly, it will be rumoured
of him: ‘This clansman uses his wealth like a “fig-tree
glutton”.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn43">43</a></sup> If this clansman earns a great income but lives hard
up, it will be rumoured of him: ‘This clansman will die like a
pauper.’ But because this clansman earns his living with moderation
... this is called a balanced livelihood. {742}</p>
<p>Brahman, righteously acquired wealth has these four pathways to
decline (apāya-mukha): a person is a philanderer, a person is a heavy
drinker, a person is a habitual gambler, a person associates and is
intimate with evil-doers. Just as in the case of a great reservoir
with four inlets and four outlets, if a person were to close the
inlets and open the outlets, and if rain were not to fall according to
the season, a decrease of that reservoir is to be expected, not an
increase.</p>
<p>Brahman, righteously acquired wealth has these four pathways to growth
(<em>āya-mukha</em>): a person is not a philanderer, a person is not a heavy
drinker, a person is not a habitual gambler, a person has friendship,
companionship, and intimacy with the good. Just as in the case of a
great reservoir with four inlets and four outlets, if a person were to
open the inlets and close the outlets, and if rain were to fall
according to the season, an increase of that reservoir is to be
expected, not a decrease....</p>
<p>Brahman, these four things lead to a clansman’s happiness and
wellbeing in the present.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn44">44</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. IV. 285-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>From here the Buddha went on to reveal the four things conducive to
future wellbeing (<em>samparāyikatthasaṁvattanika-dhamma; samparāyikattha</em>
= ‘future benefit’, ‘higher benefit’): the accomplishment of faith, the
accomplishment of moral conduct, the accomplishment of generosity, and
the accomplishment of wisdom.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#happiness-for-laypeople" id="happiness-for-laypeople">Happiness for Laypeople</a></h3>
<p>The following teaching by the Buddha given to Anāthapiṇḍaka includes the
principle referred to simply as the ‘four kinds of happiness for
laypeople’:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>There are, householder, these four kinds of happiness which should be
consistently achieved by a layperson who enjoys sensual pleasure,
depending on time and occasion. What four? The happiness of possession
(<em>atthi-sukha</em>), the happiness of consuming (<em>bhoga-sukha</em>), the
happiness of debtlessness (<em>anaṇa-sukha</em>), and the happiness of
blamelessness (<em>anavajja-sukha</em>).</p>
<p>And what is the happiness of possession? Here, a clansman possesses
wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his
arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously
gained. When he thinks, ‘I possess wealth acquired by energetic
striving ... righteously gained’, he experiences happiness and joy.
This is called the happiness of possession.</p>
<p>And what is the happiness of consuming? Here, with the wealth acquired
by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by
the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a family
man spends his wealth and does meritorious deeds. When he thinks,
‘With the wealth acquired by energetic striving ... righteously
gained, I spend my wealth and do meritorious deeds’, he experiences
happiness and joy. This is called the happiness of consuming.</p>
<p>And what is the happiness of debtlessness? Here, a family man is not
indebted to anyone to any degree, whether great or small. When he
thinks, ‘I am not indebted to anyone to any degree, whether great or
small’, he experiences happiness and joy. This is called the happiness
of debtlessness. {743}</p>
<p>And what is the happiness of blamelessness? Here, a noble disciple is
endowed with blameless conduct of body, speech and mind. When he
thinks, ‘I am endowed with blameless conduct of body, speech and
mind’, he experiences happiness and joy. This is called the happiness
of blamelessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Aware of the bliss of debtlessness,<br />
One recalls the joy of possession;<br />
When using one’s wealth,<br />
One wisely discerns the joy of consuming.<br />
Discerning with wisdom, the wise one knows<br />
Dual corresponding shares of his happiness,<br />
the first three kinds of happiness<br />
are not worth a sixteenth part<br />
Of the bliss that comes from blamelessness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn45">45</a></sup></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>A. II. 69.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3><a class="header" href="#spending-of-wealth" id="spending-of-wealth">Spending of Wealth</a></h3>
<p>At one time the Buddha gave the following teaching to Anāthapiṇḍaka on
the purpose of money and on the benefits of wealth:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Householder, there are these five benefits that should be obtained
from wealth. What five?</p>
<p>Here, with the wealth acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the
strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous
wealth righteously gained, a noble disciple makes himself joyful and
pleased, and properly maintains himself in happiness; he makes his
mother and father ... his wife and children ... his servants, workers,
and employees joyful and pleased, and properly maintains them in
happiness. This is the first benefit to be obtained from wealth.</p>
<p>Here, with the wealth acquired by energetic striving ... righteous
wealth righteously gained, a noble disciple makes his friends and
colleagues joyful and pleased, and properly maintains them in
happiness. This is the second benefit to be obtained from wealth.</p>
<p>Here, with the wealth acquired by energetic striving ... righteous
wealth righteously gained, a noble disciple protects his wealth from
the dangers that may arise from fire and floods, kings and bandits and
displeasing heirs; he makes himself secure. This is the third benefit
to be obtained from wealth.</p>
<p>Here, with the wealth acquired by energetic striving ... wealth
righteously gained, a noble disciple makes five kinds of offerings:
aid for relatives (ñāti-bali), welcoming gifts to guests
(atithi-bali), making of merit in honour of the departed
(pubbapeta-bali), support to the government (rāja-bali), and offerings
to devas (devatā-bali).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn46">46</a></sup> This is the fourth benefit to be obtained
from wealth.</p>
<p>Here, with the wealth acquired by energetic striving ... wealth
righteously gained, a noble disciple establishes an offering bearing
noble fruit – generating virtuous states of mind, resulting in
happiness, and conducive to heaven – for ascetics and brahmans who
refrain from heedlessness and negligence, who are settled in patience
and gentleness, who train themselves, calm themselves, and free
themselves from the fires of defilement. This is the fifth benefit to
be obtained from wealth. {744}</p>
<p>Householder, these are the five benefits that should be obtained from
wealth. If, when a noble disciple obtains these five benefits that
should be obtained from wealth, his wealth is depleted, he considers
thus: ‘Whatever benefit should be obtained from wealth, I have
obtained such benefit, yet my wealth is depleted.’ Thus that noble
disciple is not distressed.</p>
<p>And if, when a noble disciple obtains these five benefits that should
be obtained from wealth, his wealth increases, he considers thus:
‘Whatever benefit should be obtained from wealth, I have obtained such
benefit and my wealth has increased.’ Thus that noble disciple is not
distressed. In both circumstances he experiences no distress.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn47">47</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. III. 45.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>For wealthy householders, to be generous and to share one’s wealth with
others is considered a vital principle and a practice consistent with
the ‘path of the noble ones’, as confirmed by this teaching:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Having little, one should give a little; having a moderate amount, one
should give moderately; having a lot, one should give a lot; not to
give at all is unworthy.</p>
<p>Indeed, merchant of Kosiya, I say to you that you should use and share
[your wealth]; you should enter the path of the noble ones; a person
who eats alone experiences no joy.</p>
<p><em>J. V. 387.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Cultivating generosity can be done by undertaking regular practices and
observances. For example, one may choose to donate a specific percentage
of one’s income to assist others or to perform a special meritorious
deed once a month or once a year. Some people may even determine to not
eat a meal before they have given a gift to someone else, as is
evidenced in the story of the recently converted wealthy merchant, who
upheld this vow:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>I will not drink even a drop of water,<br />
If I have not first given a gift.</p>
<p><em>J. V. 391, 397.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3><a class="header" href="#retaining-freedom-when-acquiring-wealth" id="retaining-freedom-when-acquiring-wealth">Retaining Freedom When Acquiring Wealth</a></h3>
<p>Apart from developing awareness that material wealth is not a worthy
goal in itself but is merely a means for enhancing one’s own and others’
lives, a person should also know the limitations of wealth and recognize
the need to search for something of greater value, as described in the
following passages:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Action, knowledge, righteousness,<br />
Moral conduct, an excellent life --<br />
By these are beings purified,<br />
Not by family lineage or wealth.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn48">48</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. III. 262; S. I. 33-4, 55.</em></p>
<p>I see wealthy men in the world<br />
Who through greed share not their wealth.<br />
They hoard away their riches<br />
Longing for heightened sensual pleasures. {745}</p>
<p>A king who has conquered the earth<br />
And rules over the land stretching to the ocean,<br />
Is yet unsated with the sea’s near shore<br />
And hungers for its further shore as well.</p>
<p>Most other people too, not just kings,<br />
Meet death with craving unabated;<br />
Thus impaired they abandon their corpse;<br />
Satisfaction with sensuality is not found in the world.</p>
<p>Relatives lament and untie their hair,<br />
Crying, ‘Ah me! Alas! Our beloved is dead!’<br />
They bear away the body wrapped in a shroud,<br />
To place it on a pyre and burn it there.</p>
<p>Clad in a single shroud, the deceased leaves his wealth behind;<br />
The undertaker prods him with stakes as he burns upon the pyre.<br />
And as he dies, no relatives or friends<br />
Can offer him shelter and refuge here.</p>
<p>While his heirs carry away his wealth, this being<br />
Must pass on according to his actions;<br />
And as he dies no riches can follow him;<br />
Not child nor wife nor wealth nor estate.</p>
<p>Longevity is not acquired with wealth,<br />
Nor can prosperity banish old age;<br />
Short is this life, as all the sages say,<br />
Eternity it knows not, only change.</p>
<p>The rich and poor alike experience contact of the senses,<br />
The fool and sage are equally affected;<br />
But while the fool lies stricken by his folly,<br />
No sage will ever tremble from impingement.</p>
<p>Better is wisdom here than any wealth,<br />
Since by wisdom one gains the final goal.</p>
<p><em>M. II. 72-3; Thag. 776-84.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A vital part of engaging in right livelihood is <em>sippa</em>: vocational
knowledge, expertise, and skill.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn49">49</a></sup> The scriptures emphasize the study
of arts, crafts, and sciences, and maintain that one duty of parents is
to provide a practical education for their children.</p>
<p>Vocational knowledge on its own, however, is limited. The scriptures
therefore also highlight ‘great learning’ (<em>bāhusacca</em>) – having heard
much or studied extensively – so that one recognizes the greater
application of practical knowledge, is able to assist others
effectively, and develops comprehensive knowledge, especially knowledge
leading to right view, which is the key factor for true study.</p>
<p>The scriptures also encourage people to train in moral discipline – so
that they apply their practical skills honestly and conduct themselves
in a way that is beneficial to others and to society. Another skill that
is encouraged is to know how to speak effectively. These other forms of
knowledge complement vocational knowledge and increase a person’s
ability to help others.</p>
<p>This level of virtuous conduct accords with the following teaching by
the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Great learning, expertise, a highly-trained moral discipline, and
well-spoken speech: these are supreme blessings.... Work not piled up
and unattended to: this is a supreme blessing.... Blameless activity:
this is a supreme blessing.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn50">50</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Kh. 2; Sn. 46.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>There are numerous passages in the Pali Canon encouraging the study of
arts and sciences, for example: {746}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A person lacking knowledge of the arts and sciences earns a living
with difficulty.</p>
<p><em>J. IV. 177.</em></p>
<p>Teach your child practical knowledge.</p>
<p><em>J. IV. 429.</em></p>
<p>Study that which is worthy of study.</p>
<p><em>J. I. 421.</em></p>
<p>Whatever is called knowledge of arts and sciences leads to good
fortune.</p>
<p><em>J. I. 420.</em></p>
<p>Every branch of knowledge worthy of study – whether lofty, low, or
medial – should be analyzed and understood. One need not apply all
this knowledge at once – someday the time will come when this
knowledge comes to one’s aid.</p>
<p><em>J. III. 218.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>On this subject of supreme blessings, proficiency in the area of formal
or scholastic knowledge (<em>bāhusacca</em>) should be accompanied by practical
skill (<em>sippa</em>): a person should possess both knowledge and practical
expertise. If these two qualities are paired one can expect excellence
from a person’s work.</p>
<p>Even greater success can be expected if a person is also
well-disciplined and a skilled speaker – is able to use speech to
induce understanding in others or to bring about cooperation and
communal harmony.</p>
<p>When these factors are combined with well-organized, well-executed, and
wholesome work, a person’s work will reach perfection.</p>
<p>Because some people may become overly absorbed in gaining knowledge and
attending to work to the point of neglecting their family
responsibilities, the Buddha included two additional blessings at the
beginning of the passage, of looking after one’s parents and supporting
one’s wife and children.</p>
<p>When noble disciples have fulfilled all personal responsibilities, the
Buddha encouraged them to consider their responsibilities to other
people: to further develop virtue and participate in upholding the
righteousness of all human beings. The Buddha thus included three more
blessings at the end of the passage: of supporting one’s relatives
(<em>ñāti-saṅgaha</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn51">51</a></sup> of widespread giving (<em>dāna</em>), and of righteous
conduct (<em>dhamma-cariyā</em>).</p>
<p>To conduct oneself in line with these principles is to earn one’s
livelihood with rectitude.</p>
<p>Buddhism admits to and confirms the necessity of material things,
especially the four requisites of life, as is seen for example in the
Buddha’s frequent exhortation: ‘All beings exist by way of food’ (<em>sabbe
sattā āhāraṭṭhitikā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn52">52</a></sup> {747}</p>
<p>The true value of material things, however, is connected to moderation
and determined by how they foster a healthy and natural physical state
– of physical strength and ease, freedom from illness, and an absence
of danger from either privation or excess – and by how they support a
person’s work and the cultivation of spiritual qualities.</p>
<p>The value of material things is also determined by social conditions and
by personal factors: by one’s level of wisdom and the ability to
recognize the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of material
things, and by one’s ability to experience forms of bliss more refined
than the happiness derived from material objects.</p>
<p>For this reason Buddhism is not interested in compelling people to
distribute material wealth equally, as this does not guarantee that
people are virtuous and happy. Rather it emphasizes the minimum
requirement that all people possess an adequate amount of the four
requisites in order to survive without too much difficulty, and that
possession of material objects not be a cause for oppressing oneself or
others.</p>
<p>The Buddhist teachings also recognize that possession and consumption of
material things is related to a person’s spiritual maturity and
development: a person less spiritually developed will desire material
objects for gratification and depend on material things for happiness
more than a person of greater spiritual development.</p>
<p>A spiritual decline occurs when people forget this proper relationship
to material wealth: the need for material things becomes a misguided
search for gratification and an addiction to sensual pleasures, until
people forget that material wellbeing is a foundation for generating
superior spiritual qualities. As a consequence, people often abuse
others out of selfishness.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an attachment and enslavement to material wealth may give
rise to possessiveness and anxiety, until people are unwilling to spend
it or use it for beneficial purposes, which harms both themselves and
others and is another form of affliction.</p>
<p>Even more extreme behaviour occurs when disappointment and
disillusionment about worldly objects turns into aversion and one sets
oneself in opposition to the world. One thus creates deliberate hardship
for oneself, by following an extreme degree of austerity or by getting
caught up in practices of self-mortification in order to escape the
power of material things. On the surface, these practices resemble
living simply and keeping one’s material needs to a minimum. It is
incorrect, however, to consider these practices as ways leading to
liberation or to undergo ascetic practices without applying a deep
understanding. One should recognize that in the endeavour for liberation
people must rely to a necessary degree on material things in order to
live with wisdom and compassion.</p>
<p>A life that is free and not overly dependent on material things implies
not being seduced, blindly absorbed, or spellbound by these things. This
freedom relies on liberating wisdom (<em>nissaraṇa-paññā</em>) and on a
thorough discernment of the disadvantages and failings of material
things (<em>ādīnava-dassāvī</em>).</p>
<p>A wise person sees the many disadvantages of pleasurable sense objects
and of material things, e.g.: one can easily become enslaved by them;
one may rely on them entirely for one’s happiness; they do not
necessarily lead to higher spiritual qualities like peace of mind; and
when one is attached to them they even become an obstacle to realizing
these higher states.</p>
<p>Moreover, by their very nature, these things are void of an inherent
perfection which would be able to truly gratify our desires and to
provide satisfaction. They are impermanent, unstable, and transient;
they cannot be truly owned and are not truly subject to our control; and
in the end they must break up and dissolve. {748}</p>
<p>To relate to these things with ignorance is to create grief and
suffering. They were not born along with us and when we die they will
not follow us. The purpose of seeking and owning these things is to use
them for solving problems and alleviating suffering, and for developing
true happiness, not to increase our suffering.</p>
<p>There is no merit to hoarding up wealth. The more one is enslaved to
wealth, the greater is one’s affliction.</p>
<p>When one recognizes the above truths, one derives the true value from
material wealth, spends money to benefit oneself and others, and
cultivates the four ‘favourable qualities’ (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn53">53</a></sup> for
example by giving, by establishing a society that guards against
wrongdoing, promotes virtue, and encourages spiritual development, and
by supporting those people who uphold the truth. One does not possess
wealth solely to increase wealth, nor does one generate wealth simply to
consume more and to seek self-gratification.</p>
<p>Buddhism holds in high esteem those laypeople who work with diligence,
obtain wealth through honest means, are charitable and take
responsibility for others, and spend their money on wholesome causes;
such people are referred to as ‘victors in this world and the
next’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn54">54</a></sup></p>
<p>Even more excellent are those people freed through wisdom from mental
defilement, who do not fall victim to wealth or to personal possessions,
who do not allow the acquisition of wealth to be a source of woe, who
are able to live with a joyful heart, who come into contact with worldly
things but are not stained by them,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn55">55</a></sup> and who are able to disengage
from suffering when it arises in various circumstances. These are the
true masters (<em>issara-jana</em>), the true liberated ones (<em>serī-puggala</em>).</p>
<p>Such laypeople may be awakened up to the stage of non-returner, yet they
are fully attentive to and engaged in their work. The Buddha did not
approve of laypeople being concerned only with immediate needs or
desires without preparation for the future or by abandoning their
duties, which can be a form of attachment to non-attachment.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#dual-freedom-of-the-sangha" id="dual-freedom-of-the-sangha">Dual Freedom of the Sangha</a></h3>
<p>The monastic community (<em>saṅgha</em>) acts as an exemplar to people for a
life relying in the least degree on material things, or for a life with
the greatest degree of freedom from material things. This life is
connected to the wider society in the following ways: first, the
monastic life provides an opportunity for monks<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn56">56</a></sup> to live a life of
simplicity; second, this life allows monks to fully devote their time
and energy to Dhamma-related activities without needing to get caught up
in seeking material possessions; third, this life urges monks to be easy
to support, by recognizing that they do not earn a living by themselves
and are dependent on the lay community; and fourth, the monastic
community, by not seeking recompense for its labour in the usual sense
of market exchange, is as free as possible from the control and
influence by the mainstream social and political system in which it
finds itself.</p>
<p>All monks, regardless of whether they are enlightened or not, are bound
by the principle of living primarily for truth and keeping their
material needs to a minimum.</p>
<p>The Buddha did not intend for laypeople to live monastic or austere
lives, nor did he wish for everyone to be ordained as a monk. It is a
natural, causal truth that at any one time, different people abide at
different stages of spiritual development, and that they will have
varying needs and desires. Even the majority of stream-enterers, or at
least a large percentage of them, live at home with their families.
{749}</p>
<p>The Buddha’s intention in this respect was most likely to establish an
independent community within the wider society, in order to act as a
balance in the domain of righteousness and truth, to sustain the
principles of truth within society, and to provide an escape from the
controlling influence of society for those people who both desired and
were prepared for such freedom.</p>
<p>This community exists both in physical form and as an ideal. The
independent community as a physical entity is the bhikkhu sangha –
sometimes referred to as the conventional sangha (<em>sammati-saṅgha</em>) –
which exists alongside and is yet free from the wider lay
community.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn57">57</a></sup> The independent community as an ideal is the ‘community
of true disciples’ (<em>sāvaka-saṅgha</em>) – sometimes referred to as the
‘noble community’ (<em>ariya-saṅgha</em>) – which exists alongside yet apart
from the wider community of unawakened beings.</p>
<p>The gist of this principle is that a model society is not one in which
everyone is the same (such a society is impossible to accomplish), but
rather is one in which all members, although they may differ in
individual circumstances, are devoted to spiritual growth, live together
in concord, and strive for the same goal. Such a model provides a
wholesome alternative to those people who no longer wish to live within
the confines of the wider society. (Even in the future era of Maitreya
Buddha, during which time supposedly everyone is equal, there will be an
independent community of monks.)</p>
<p>In regard to the bhikkhu sangha, for the monks to dwell in and to
maintain such independence, they must have a way of life that relies
little on material things. Moreover, they must possess the mental
qualities that are favourable to such a way of life. An important
quality the Buddha emphasized for the bhikkhus and for all renunciants
is contentment (<em>santosa</em>), which enables one to live simply and to
experience joy independent of material things.</p>
<p>The monks need not expend time, effort, and attention on acquiring
material things. Instead, they can fully devote their time, determined
effort, and attention to their spiritual practice in order to achieve
wisdom and freedom of mind. The principles of contentment and delight in
practice are embodied in the Buddha’s teaching of the fourfold
traditional practice of the noble ones (<em>ariya-vaṁsa</em>; the four
principles of the ‘noble lineage’ – see below).</p>
<p>The bhikkhus follow a simple lifestyle and do not engage in arts and
sciences in order to earn a living. By relying on an ancient tradition,
they subsist on the four requisites offered by the lay community. At the
same time, they have no right to solicit food or the other requisites.
For this reason they should make themselves easy to support and content
with little, and conform to the four principles of the ‘noble lineage’
(<em>ariya-vaṁsa</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Here, a monk in this teaching and training is content with any kind
of robe, and he speaks in praise of contentment with any kind of
robe; he does not engage in a wrong search, in what is improper, for
the sake of a robe. If he does not get a robe he is not agitated,
and if he gets one he uses it without being tied to it, infatuated
with it, or obsessed with it; he sees the danger in it,
understanding the escape. Yet, because of this, he does not extol
himself or disparage others. Any monk who is skilled in this,
energetic, not remiss, clearly comprehending and mindful, is said to
be dwelling in an ancient, pristine, noble lineage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further, a monk is content with any kind of almsfood.... {750}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further, a monk is content with any kind of lodging....</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further, a monk finds delight in the development of wholesome
qualities, is delighted with the development of wholesome qualities,
finds delight in the abandoning of unwholesome qualities, is
delighted with the abandoning of unwholesome qualities. Yet, because
of this, he does not extol himself or disparage others. Any monk who
is skilled in this development (bhāvanā) and abandonment (pahāna),
energetic, not remiss, clearly comprehending and mindful, is said to
be dwelling in an ancient, pristine, noble lineage.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn58">58</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Qualities like contentment correspond to the discipline and moral
conduct of the bhikkhu sangha. The moral code for the bhikkhus was
prescribed in order to foster contentment in the monks, and to support
them in their dedication to cultivating wholesome qualities and
abandoning unwholesome qualities.</p>
<p>The commentaries classify four aspects of moral conduct of the monastic
sangha, which are collectively referred to as <em>pārisuddhi-sīla</em> (’moral
conduct leading to purity’ or ‘pure behaviour designated as moral
conduct’), as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn59">59</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Pāṭimokkhasaṁvara-sīla</em>: morality as restraint in regard to the
Pāṭimokkha: to abstain from forbidden conduct, to adhere to
permissible forms of conduct, and to practise strictly in regard to
the training rules. The commentators claim that this factor is
accomplished by way of faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Indriyasaṁvara-sīla</em>: morality as sense restraint: to be careful
not to allow evil, unwholesome mind states, like desire, attachment,
aversion, and indignation, to overpower the mind when receiving the
six sense objects: when the eye sees forms, the ear hears sounds,
the nose smells odours, the tongue savours tastes, the body
experiences tactile sensations, and the mind cognizes mental
objects. The commentators claim that this factor is accomplished by
way of mindfulness (<em>sati</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ājīvapārisuddhi-sīla</em>: morality as purity of livelihood: to earn
one’s living righteously and in a pure manner; to avoid seeking gain
by incorrect means, e.g.: to not falsely claim supernormal states,
like concentrative attainments or stages of enlightenment,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn60">60</a></sup> and
to not verbally appeal for food for oneself if one is not ill; to
abstain from deception (<em>kuhanā</em>), for example by affecting a severe
manner or countenance in order to instil faith in laypeople and
induce them to offer the four requisites; to abstain from flattery
(<em>lapanā</em>) in order to gain food; to abstain from hinting in order
to obtain the requisites; to abstain from resorting to threats and
disparagement so as to urge laypeople to offer the requisites; and
to abstain from pursuing gain with gain, for example by giving
someone a small gift with the hope that he will offer much in
return. The commentators claim that this factor is accomplished by
way of effort (<em>viriya</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paccayasannissita-sīla</em>: morality connected to the four requisites:
to use the four requisites with wise consideration
(<em>paccaya-paccavekkhaṇa</em>), by understanding their true purpose and
value; to refrain from using them out of greed. One eats food, for
example, in order to nourish and strengthen the body, to live at
ease, to be able to perform one’s duties, and to advance in the
threefold training. One does not eat for sense gratification,
entertainment, or amusement. The commentators claim that this factor
is accomplished by way of wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). {751}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
<p>In the context of the lay community, there are several forms of conduct
that should be emphasized in relation to personal wealth:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> In terms of the individual, the Buddha specifically praised those
wealthy persons who acquire their wealth through diligent effort and by
righteous means, and who spend their money for wholesome, meritorious
purposes. He praised virtue and benevolence over wealth itself.</p>
<p>It is important to instil a sense of values in contemporary people so
that they recognize that it is a source of pride to accumulate wealth
through effort and honest means and to determine to use that wealth for
doing good deeds.</p>
<p>Praising people simply because they are wealthy, by considering that
they have accumulated merit from good deeds in the past (in previous
lifetimes)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn61">61</a></sup> and by failing to consider the causes for that wealth in
this lifetime, is incorrect from the perspective of Buddhism in two
ways: first, it does not accord with the praise bestowed by the Buddha
on those wealthy persons as mentioned above. And second, it does not
involve a wise and complete assessment of causes and conditions,
especially the causes and conditions in the present life, which have the
most direct relationship to the person’s circumstances and should thus
be given more importance.</p>
<p>Past kamma can only act as an initial foundation, say of providing
physical attributes, mental aptitude, quickness of mind, and personal
disposition, which supports actions in this lifetime.</p>
<p>Granted, past actions play an important role for being born in a wealthy
family, but even here the Buddha did not mark such a fact as
particularly praiseworthy, because a general principle of Buddhism is
that of not glorifying or overly prizing a person’s family or status of
birth.</p>
<p>The Buddha praised wholesome actions, which are the causes for this
individual to receive such a desirable result. Being born into a wealthy
family is in itself a boon; there is no need to add to this by praise.
According to Buddhism, such a birth is seen as starting capital, which
gives such a person a good opportunity or even an advantage over other
people in making progress in this life; the results from past actions
have thus come to fruition and the person has reached a new starting
point. The Buddha praised or criticized how such a person applies this
starting capital.</p>
<p>In general, the Buddha’s praise or criticism focuses on whether one
generates wealth through honest, righteous means, or fails to do so, and
on how one then conducts oneself in relation to such wealth. The Buddha
did not praise or criticize wealth itself or rich people; rather he
praised or criticized rich people’s behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> In terms of society, Buddhism teaches that material wealth is a
support for life; it is not the goal of life. Wealth should thus
facilitate and prepare people for living a virtuous life and for
performing good deeds in order to realize higher levels of spiritual
excellence. Wherever and to whomever riches arise, it should benefit all
human beings and be conducive to their wellbeing. {752}</p>
<p>Following this principle, when an individual becomes wealthy, all people
are enriched and the entire society prospers; when a good person
acquires wealth, his or her community also acquires wealth. Such a
person is like a fertile field in which rice flourishes for the benefit
of all.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn62">62</a></sup></p>
<p>A wealthy person can feel satisfied and honoured to receive society’s
trust and to act as a delegate for society in the sharing of wealth to
support and nourish fellow human beings and to provide them with an
opportunity for true growth.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn63">63</a></sup></p>
<p>On the contrary, if some individuals become more wealthy but society as
a whole deteriorates and the suffering of other people increases, this
indicates that there is an improper conduct in regard to material
wealth. The generated wealth does not become a supportive factor, which
is the true purpose of wealth. Before long there will be unrest in
society. In the end either the status of those wealthy members of
society or the structure of society as a whole will be unsustainable.
Members of the wider community may remove the wealthy and influential
individuals from their positions of power, and establish a new system
along with new executives for the allocation of wealth, which may be an
improvement or a worsening of the situation.</p>
<p>In any case, there exists this truth that if people conduct themselves
incorrectly in relation to material wealth, which arises for the benefit
of all, wealth ends up harming and destroying human nature, human
beings, and human society.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> In terms of a state or a nation, Buddhism recognizes these
important aspects of material wealth: poverty is a form of
suffering,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn64">64</a></sup> poverty and deprivation are crucial causes for crime and
wrongdoing in society (as is the related factor of greed),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn65">65</a></sup> and it
is the responsibility of the state or of political leaders to care for
and allocate funds to the poor and to ensure that there are no destitute
people in the country.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>To address these issues various measures are required which are often
specific to the circumstances, e.g.: to provide citizens with
opportunities for making an honest living; to create jobs; to allocate
funds and other means of assistance, according to the teaching on the
four virtues making for national integration
(<em>rāja-saṅgahavatthu</em>);<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn67">67</a></sup> and to prevent immoral or unrighteous
activities, like exploitation. In this sense, the state should consider
the reduction and absence of poverty as a better measurement for its
success than the increase of wealthy individuals in that society. The
absence of poverty is a result of social management that does not
neglect the spiritual development of the people in society.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> In terms of economics and politics, it is frequently asked what
sort of economic system or government best conforms to the principles of
Buddhism. Basically, this is not a question that Buddhism is required to
answer; or at the risk of stating a tautology, one can respond that any
system that is applied in harmony with Buddhist values and principles is
valid. {753}</p>
<p>Economic or political systems should be analyzed according to how they
are practised, an analysis which changes or is modified as a result of
environmental conditions related to time and place. Here it should be
reiterated that the purpose and true benefit of material wealth is that
it acts as a support for human beings in coordinating their lives, to
enable them to live together peacefully, to perform meritorious deeds,
and to realize higher levels of spiritual excellence. Thus, when wealth
manifests for an individual, society as a whole benefits and all people
will prosper. Whichever economic or political system effectuates such a
wholesome outcome is in harmony with Buddhism.</p>
<p>Obvious examples of how social systems are connected to specific
temporal and regional factors are the following: when the Buddha
established the monastic community with its distinct task and objective,
he set down a discipline limiting the monks’ personal possessions to the
eight requisites;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn68">68</a></sup> other possessions belong to the community as a
whole. In relation to the lay community, who at that time in India
(Jambudīpa)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn69">69</a></sup> observed two forms of governance, the Buddha taught the
‘conditions of prosperity’ (<em>aparihāniya-dhamma</em>) for those republican
states (or those states governed by a quorum), and he taught the
‘imperial observances’ (<em>cakkavatti-vatta</em>) for those states governed by
a monarchy.</p>
<p>These accounts demonstrate how Buddha-Dhamma is not merely a philosophy
or an abstract teaching, but rather it is a practical teaching, which is
connected to people active within society and to real-life
circumstances. The teachings need to be applicable, relevant, and
beneficial to people’s daily lives.</p>
<p>If one waits until one has completely finished establishing a so-called
ideal political system (the superiority of which can never be
conclusively proved) before people are able to experience happiness and
wellbeing, how can one escape from hypothetical notions and credulity?</p>
<p>In the case where both republics and monarchies existed, the Buddha
found ways to benefit those people living under these different
political systems. In the case of a republic, the Buddha suggested ways
to strengthen and secure the people’s mutual endeavours; in the case of
a monarchy, he encouraged the rulers to recognize that prestige and
power should be tools for benefiting the people, not for
self-gratification and self-indulgence.</p>
<p>In the period of King Asoka, when the system of monarchy reached its
zenith, the King adhered to Buddhist principles of governance while
ruling the country, as is confirmed by the dictum carved into one of the
Asokan pillars:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>His Majesty the Supreme Emperor, he who looks with kindness on the
world, loved by the gods, does not assign great value to [his own]
honour and prestige, unless he desires these with this objective in
mind: ‘Both in the present and in the future may people listen to my
instructions with devotion and practise in accord with the righteous
way.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn70">70</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When people have understood the gist and objective of the Buddhist
teachings related to economics and politics, the detailed task of
determining which system truly conforms to Buddhism rests with scholars
of these systems to debate.</p>
<p>Similarly, if people wish to think up new systems of governance, which
improve upon pre-existing ones, that is even better, but these matters
go beyond the preserve of this book.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#virtuous-conduct-and-moral-codes" id="virtuous-conduct-and-moral-codes">Virtuous Conduct and Moral Codes</a></h2>
<p>Moral codes are established to guide people’s behaviour and speech. They
deal with people’s relationship to their external environment,
especially the relationship to other human beings. And they maintain a
way of life that is well-ordered and mutually beneficial for all members
of society. Moral codes assist people within a particular society to
increase virtuous activities so that they can realize the highest goal
according to their belief system and to support them in spreading their
beliefs, activities and virtues among other groups of people. In
Buddhism, the teachings which address society directly and express the
spirit of Buddhist social relationships are the teachings on <em>sīla</em>
(’ethics’, ‘moral conduct’, ‘virtuous conduct’).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn71">71</a></sup></p>
<p>The most basic moral code is to not harm other people, either physically
or verbally, and to not impair mindfulness and clear comprehension,
which protect a person’s moral integrity. In Buddha-Dhamma this basic
moral code is most often described and embodied as the Five Precepts.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#important-terms-pertaining-to-morality-sīla-vinaya-and-sikkhāpada" id="important-terms-pertaining-to-morality-sīla-vinaya-and-sikkhāpada">Important Terms Pertaining to Morality: Sīla, Vinaya, and Sikkhāpada</a></h3>
<p>Before looking at this subject of morality more closely, we should
examine some of the relevant Pali terms.</p>
<p>Many Pali terms have various nuances of meaning, which leads to a degree
of complexity. Some of these terms have been adopted into the Thai
language, yet their meanings have occasionally deviated from the
original meanings. Some of these terms have even taken on opposite
meanings from those they originally had. These terms thus need to be
constantly reviewed and reexamined.</p>
<p>There are three primary terms relevant to this subject of moral conduct:
<em>sīla</em>, <em>vinaya</em>, and <em>sikkhāpada</em>. On the whole, in the original Pali,
the meanings of these three terms are clearly distinguished.
Occasionally, these terms are used in a broad or colloquial sense, and
may be interchangeable. Technically speaking, however, their meanings
are strictly defined and distinguished, in order to avoid confusion.
{915}</p>
<p>Here are the basic meanings of these three terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla:</em> virtuous conduct and moral rectitude expressed by way of
body and speech. Being a collective term, <em>sīla</em> is used in the
singular (it is a ‘mass noun’; it is not divided into subfactors).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vinaya:</em> an established code of behaviour and practice; a framework
for living one’s life, containing rules, precepts, laws,
prescriptions, etc., for guiding and monitoring one’s conduct in a
harmonious and integrated way, leading to order, discipline,
success, and fulfilment. This term too is a collective term and is
used in the singular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sikkhāpada:</em> rules of training and practice, especially those
prescribed by the Buddha, stipulating an obligation to perform an
action or to refrain from an action, in order to bring about correct
and righteous conduct. This term may be used either in the singular
or in the plural.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Combined, all the training rules (<em>sikkhāpada</em>) comprise a code of
discipline (<em>vinaya</em>). Practising in accord with the training rules and
being established in the code of discipline (or conduct in harmony with
the training rules and the code of discipline) is referred to as ‘moral
conduct’ (<em>sīla</em>).</p>
<p>For example, the 227 training rules for monks are called the bhikkhu
Vinaya. Those monks who uphold the Vinaya (those who follow the training
rules correctly) are considered established in moral conduct. The same
holds true for those bhikkhunis who uphold the bhikkhuni Vinaya
comprising 311 training rules.</p>
<p>For Buddhist laypeople, there are the five training rules or five
precepts (<em>pañca-sikkhāpada</em>), beginning with abstaining from killing
living creatures. Laypeople who uphold these five precepts are
considered established in morality (such moral conduct is occasionally
referred to as <em>pañcasikkhāpada-sīla</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn72">72</a></sup></p>
<p>These are the strict definitions. As mentioned above, however, these
three terms are sometimes used in a broad sense, in which case they may
be used interchangeably. A common example of this is to refer to the
five precepts (<em>pañca-sikkhāpada</em>) as the five moral observances
(<em>pañca-sīla</em>). This term <em>pañca-sīla</em> is used only seldom in the
Tipiṭaka; its use is probably for the sake of brevity, in particular in
poetic verses. It is used frequently in the commentaries. Although the
term <em>sikkhāpada</em> in this context in unfamiliar to some people, it is
clearly evident in the formal verses for undertaking the precepts.</p>
<p>When the term <em>sīla</em> is used to replace <em>sikkhāpada</em>, it too can be used
in the plural, comprising various training rules or precepts. Its
meaning is thus expanded beyond the moral character of those who behave
correctly according to a code of discipline or a set of precepts. {916}</p>
<p>In the original Pali, the term <em>vinaya</em> was a very important term with
many nuances of meaning. For example, it represents a key system of
conduct, paired with the term <em>dhamma</em> in the compound Dhammavinaya.
Many of this term’s nuances lie outside of the triad mentioned above, of
<em>sīla</em>, <em>vinaya</em>, and <em>sikkhāpada</em>. At least in the Thai language
(pronounced ‘vinai’ – วินัย), its meaning has become rather ambiguous
and imprecise. And even in Buddhist circles the term <em>vinaya</em> is used in
a vague and imprecise way.</p>
<p>In Thailand, the term <em>vinai</em> is frequently used in the context of
business activities and other everyday enterprises. In this context,
however, its meaning is greatly restricted, referring to self-control,
disciplined constraint, an adherence to rules and regulations, etc., for
example in the expression ‘traffic discipline’ (’vinai jarahjawn’ –
<em>vinaya carācara</em>). The term <em>vinai</em> has thus developed a meaning
pertaining to a person’s attributes, namely, to a steadfastness in
self-control and an ability to follow specific rules and principles
(here, its meaning begins to overlap with that of <em>sīla</em>).</p>
<p>A split appears to have occurred. In the monasteries, or in relation to
religious matters, people use the term <em>sīla</em> (in Thai pronounced ‘seen’
– ศีล), while in relation to mundane matters people use the term
<em>vinaya</em>. This is true even though both of these terms are vital to the
Buddhist teachings.</p>
<p>When Buddhists (including the monks) become estranged from the essence
of the Dhammavinaya, their understanding of relevant terms becomes
obscured. Of the three terms mentioned above, <em>sīla</em>, which refers to
the moral character of an individual, is the aim and purpose of the
other two terms. Spiritual training in line with precepts and guided by
a code of discipline is intended to generate moral integrity in people.
Eventually, the term <em>sīla</em> has been used to encompass the meanings of
all three of these terms. The terms <em>vinaya</em> and <em>sikkhāpada</em> remain
behind-the-scene, and the term <em>sīla</em>, becoming an umbrella term, has
also become vague.</p>
<p>Moral conduct is the first factor in the threefold training (<em>tisso
sikkhā</em>), whereby one cultivates moral integrity (<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>),
power of the mind (<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>), and wisdom (<em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>).
This is a matter of individual spiritual training. For individual
people, and indeed the entire world, to exist in a state of wellbeing,
one must provide a suitable training for people, in order for them to be
spiritually accomplished. This training begins with individuals, who are
then actively engaged in society.</p>
<p>A closer look at this process of training, however, reveals that
spiritual development requires an ability to relate to other people in
society. Everyone is engaged in specific social activities, which may
assist at all levels of spiritual development, from cultivating the
sense bases to cultivating wisdom. People are also engaged in managing
their physical environments, allocating the four requisites and other
material things, eating, earning a livelihood, governance, etc. All of
these activities pertain to the concept of <em>vinaya</em>.</p>
<p>Although <em>vinaya</em> is grouped alongside <em>sīla</em>, it has a distinct scope
or boundary. These terms cannot be used interchangeably and should not
be confused for one another.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn73">73</a></sup> {917}</p>
<p>These explanations are intended to act as a foundation for this
discussion of moral conduct. A clear understanding of these relevant

<p>Broadly speaking, there are two levels of morality (<em>sīla</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, is the universal level or the level of absolute truth
(Dhamma).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn74">74</a></sup> This includes teachings or principles of conduct that
are taught (<em>desita</em>) to show how people who perform good or bad
actions, or who observe or violate moral precepts, will receive the
fruits of these good and bad actions automatically and in accord
with cause and effect, or in accord with the law of kamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, is the conventional level, which refers to a specific code
of ethics (<em>vinaya</em>) containing rules and regulations that have been
laid down and prescribed (<em>paññatta</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn75">75</a></sup> These formal codes are
used to govern and direct individuals in a particular community or
group, conforming to the group’s aims and objectives. A person who
transgresses the rules defined by a specific code of ethics is
accountable to the authority of that particular group, and his or
her transgression is distinct from the negative consequences of
unwholesome intention that inevitably follow according to the
natural law of kamma.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn76">76</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>From the perspective of the entire human race, people live under
different conditions according to time and place: people are subject to
varying social, economic, and political circumstances, determined by the
localities and time periods in which they live. It is impossible to lay
down a detailed, strictly-defined, and authoritative ethical code that
will be constructive and advantageous to people in every time period and
social environment.</p>
<p>For the universal human community, Buddhism teaches or recommends the
group of factors most often referred to as the ‘five precepts’
(<em>pañca-sīla</em>), as the most basic moral code or as the minimum level of
moral behaviour. Beyond these, there are the moral precepts contained in
the ‘ten wholesome courses of action’ (<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>;
specifically, the first seven of the ten factors), and the moral
components of the Eightfold Path – right speech, right action, and
right livelihood<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn77">77</a></sup> – which are comprehensive moral principles. {918}</p>
<p>The Buddha presented these moral principles as aspects of absolute
truth: a person who observes these or fails to observe them will receive
good or bad results according to the laws of nature. If a person decides
to follow the teaching of the Buddha, he or she adopts these moral
principles as conditions for spiritual practice.</p>
<p>In other words, the Buddhist teachings stipulate that one must accept as
a minimum level of practice the acknowledgment and acceptance of the
five precepts. As mentioned above, the five precepts are also referred
to as the five <em>sikkhāpada</em>: the five ‘observances’ or the five ‘rules
of training’.</p>
<p>This is the basic level of practice for Buddhist male and female lay
disciples, but of course they may wish to adopt a more refined level of
moral training, for example by keeping the eight precepts on the
‘observance days’. (See
Note <a href="#note-observance-days">Observance Days</a>)</p>
<p>The Dhamma exists on the levels of virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>),
concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). Moral discipline
(<em>vinaya</em>) is limited to the first level, of virtuous conduct.
(Concentration and wisdom are classified exclusively as aspects of
Dhamma.) In sum, virtuous conduct exists both on the level of Dhamma and
the level of <em>vinaya</em>. {722}</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Observance Days</span><a id="note-observance-days"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Trans.: the observance days follow the lunar calendar and fall on
the full-, new-, and half-moon days. These days were used as an
occasion by pre-Buddhist spiritual communities to expound their
teachings, a practice that was adopted by the Buddha. Other
observances, for example the recitation of the Pāṭimokkha on the full-
and new-moons, occur on these days.]</p>
<p>The terms <em>aṭṭhaṅgasamannāgata-uposatha</em> (’the observance consisting
of eight factors’) and <em>aṭṭhaṅgika-uposatha</em> (’the eightfold
observance’) are found at A. I. 212-2; A. IV. 248-63. The term <em>aṭṭha
uposathaṅga</em> (’the eight observances’) is found at Vin. V. 136-7, 213.
These terms are the origin of the term ‘eight precepts’
(<em>aṭṭha-sīla</em>), which was coined later and is not found in the
Tipiṭaka.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Let us explore this twofold division of <em>sīla</em>:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn78">78</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Moral conduct as Dhamma. This refers to those principles of
behaviour pertaining to moral conduct – to physical actions,
speech, and livelihood – that are taught in connection to an ideal
and natural state of human conduct. By acting in conformity with
these principles, or by violating them, one reaps good or bad
results directly, being accountable to natural laws. A related
definition for <em>sīla</em> here is: ‘moral conduct and moral discipline
that becomes one’s regular and normal way of behaviour or that
becomes a personal attribute.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral conduct as <em>vinaya</em>: a set of rules and regulations formulated
as a social legislation for directing people’s behaviour in accord
with the specific aims of a community or society. This system of
management and supervision also includes means of punishing those
who transgress these rules. (This punishment is separate from the
repercussions occurring as a consequence of the laws of nature.)</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, <em>vinaya</em> is not yet <em>sīla</em>, but is rather linked
to <em>sīla</em>. It refers to a social system and procedure for
establishing people in moral conduct; it is a way of training people
in virtue. <em>Sīla</em> is aided by <em>vinaya</em>, but as it is an aspect of
absolute truth (Dhamma), it is not identical to <em>vinaya</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The way to distinguish between these two is that Dhamma is a matter of
absolute, natural conditions, whereas moral discipline is dependent on a
specific human society or on the ingenuity of human beings.</p>
<p>Having made this distinction, one can discuss the term <em>sīla</em> in a broad
and flexible fashion, as various stages or aspects, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em> refers to virtuous behaviour in relation to other people and
to one’s surroundings; this behaviour generates blessings for
oneself and for others, including one’s society and natural
environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em> refers to a moral code, laid down to foster a well-ordered,
peaceful society whose members can live their lives at ease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em> refers to a means for governing people’s behaviour, leading
to disciplined and impeccable physical and verbal conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em> refers to a collection of training rules used for eliminating
course defilements that manifest by way of body or speech, and for
leading to greater spiritual refinement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em> refers to a set of rules for developing a person’s physical
actions, speech, and livelihood, in order to create a foundation for
cultivating and empowering the mind on the level of concentration
(<em>samādhi</em>) and for increasing the mind’s capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em> refers to the natural state of physical action, speech, and
livelihood of a virtuous person – a person who has been
well-trained, who has gained true knowledge, and who has reached an
exalted spiritual realization.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The heart of moral conduct lies with intention: to be free from any
thoughts of moral transgression. One aspect of moral transgression is to
violate rules, regulations, precepts, and codes of discipline that have
been specifically laid down. Another aspect of moral transgression is
the violation of other people: the intention to harm others. <em>Sīla</em> can
thus be interpreted in two ways: the intention to transgress an ethical
code or the intention to violate and oppress other people. Put simply,
the term <em>sīla</em> means non-transgression and non-harming.</p>
<p>Viewed from another angle, <em>sīla</em> refers to self-control and vigilance:
the refraining from and prevention of evil actions. And in the most
profound sense <em>sīla</em> can be defined as the state of mind of a person
who is free from all thoughts of transgression and all thoughts of
maltreatment.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn79">79</a></sup></p>
<p>The general rules of training (<em>sikkhāpada</em>) in Buddhism are the link
between morality on the level of Dhamma and morality on the level of
discipline, because these rules are based on universal moral principles
and compiled as a moral code (<em>vinaya</em>). Nevertheless, Buddhism does not
establish a single ethical code that all people must invariably observe.
An ethical code is a matter for members of a specific community to
formulate by consensus as is suited to their circumstances and
objectives, by choosing from various moral principles, and then to
adhere to this code. For example, the commentators formulated the
‘householder’s discipline’ (<em>āgāriya-vinaya</em>) based on abstaining from
the ten unwholesome courses of action.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn80">80</a></sup> Similarly, they formulated
the ‘layman’s discipline’ (<em>gihi-vinaya</em>) based on the Buddha’s
teachings on conduct found in the Siṅgālaka Sutta, for example to
abstain from the four biases (<em>agati</em>), to not indulge in the six ‘paths
to ruin’ (<em>apāya-mukha</em>), and to uphold a proper relationship to the
‘six directions’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn81">81</a></sup> (See
Note <a href="#note-layman">The Layman’s Discipline</a>)</p>
<p>Here is a review of the five precepts and the ten wholesome courses of
action:</p>
<p>Five Precepts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To abstain from killing living creatures (<em>pāṇātipāta</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from taking what is not freely given (<em>adinnādāna</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from sexual misconduct (<em>kāmesumicchācāra</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from speaking falsehoods (<em>musāvāda</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from spirits, liquor, and intoxicants which are a basis
for heedlessness (<em>surāmerayamajja-pamādaṭṭhānā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ten Wholesome Courses of Action:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To abstain from killing living creatures (<em>pāṇātipāta veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from taking what is not freely given (<em>adinnādāna
veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from sexual misconduct (<em>kāmesumicchācāra veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from false speech (<em>musāvāda veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from divisive speech (<em>pisuṇāya vācāya veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from harsh speech (<em>pharusā vācāya veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To abstain from idle chatter (<em>samphappalāpā veramaṇī</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-covetousness (<em>anabhijjhā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-ill-will (<em>abyāpāda</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the older Pali texts, when referring to the general moral conduct of
people, the Buddha uses the term ‘five virtues’ (<em>pañca-dhamma</em>) for the
five precepts.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn82">82</a></sup> In reference to rules of training for lay Buddhists
or to rules of conduct for lay ‘noble disciples’, the term ‘five rules
of training’ (<em>pañca-sikkhāpada</em>) is used.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn83">83</a></sup> The term ‘five precepts’
(<em>pañca-sīla</em>) occurs once in the Vinaya-Piṭaka<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn84">84</a></sup> and occasionally in
verse passages in the secondary texts of the Tipiṭaka;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn85">85</a></sup> in the
commentaries it is frequently used.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn86">86</a></sup></p>
<p>The following question may be posed: between the five precepts and the
ten wholesome courses of action, which should be given more emphasis in
teaching? Alternatively, if one begins by teaching the five precepts,
when should one include the teaching of the ten wholesome courses of
action? This will be discussed below, but if one examines the contents
of the Tipiṭaka, there are more passages related to the ten wholesome
courses of action than to the five precepts.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">The Layman’s Discipline</span><a id="note-layman"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This discipline is equivalent to the <em>āgāriya-vinaya</em>. The Siṅgālaka
Sutta (or Sigālovāda Sutta) is found at D. III. 180-93 and includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>abandoning the four defilements of action (<em>kamma-kilesa</em>),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>abstaining from the four biases,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not indulging in the six paths to ruin,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>paying homage to the six directions,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a teaching on true and false friendship,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the way to spend one’s wealth,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the four ‘bases of social solidarity’ (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This formulation in the commentaries may have originated from
Buddhists at that time period having upheld these principles.
Contemporary Buddhists should take this example by selecting teachings
on moral conduct, both from this sutta and elsewhere (e.g. the five
qualities of a lay disciple – <em>upāsaka-dhamma</em>), and establishing a
discipline for themselves. Although this discipline would apply to
their own personal community and not necessarily to all Buddhists, it
would still be of benefit.</p>
<p>This form of specialized ethical code is found in every time period.
Examples include the concepts of <em>kula-dhamma</em> (teachings on conduct
specific to a family, ethnic group, caste, or profession – a code of
ethics belonging to an occupation, guild, or institution) and
<em>desa-dhamma</em> (an ethical code specific to a locality), which are
considered ‘traditional’ forms of morality (Vism. 15; VismṬ.:
Sīlaniddesavaṇṇanā, Sīlappabhedakathāvaṇṇanā).</p>

</div>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-bhikkhu-code-of-discipline-and-its-relationship-to-society" id="the-bhikkhu-code-of-discipline-and-its-relationship-to-society">The Bhikkhu Code of Discipline and Its Relationship to Society</a></h2>
<p>What has been mentioned above refers primarily to ethics as it concerns
the lay community. For the community of monks (<em>bhikkhu saṅgha</em>), the
system of moral training can be laid down in a much more explicit way
because the Buddha established this community himself according to
predetermined principles and objectives, i.e. to support a practice that
is most conducive for reaching the highest goal of Buddhism and to
spread the goodness that results from this practice far and wide, for
the welfare and happiness of all inhabitants of the world. The Buddha
formulated a system of rules and regulations to help guide the life and
behaviour of the bhikkhus, in order to give rise to positive results
according to these principles and objectives. {919}</p>
<p>The members of this community – those individuals who are ordained as
monks – enter voluntarily and thus they all accept to practise
according to these rules. This moral code is the Vinaya of the bhikkhu
sangha.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn87">87</a></sup></p>
<p>The Vinaya is composed of numerous training rules, including rules on
how monks should behave while alone, how they should behave amongst each
other, how they should behave in relation to other people, e.g. the lay
community, how they should behave in relation to nature and their
environment, and how they should govern their community and conduct
communal affairs. A similar code of discipline was laid down for the
nuns’ community (the bhikkhuni Vinaya).</p>
<p>Those candidates who for some reason are not fully prepared for higher
ordination may be accepted as novices, having limited status and
privileges in the monastic community. The Buddha laid down ten training
rules for novices which are included in the Vinaya.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn88">88</a></sup></p>
<p>Virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>) in this context is the state of wellbeing or
the wholesome behaviour that stems from not transgressing the training
rules contained in the Vinaya: this is morality (<em>sīla</em>) on the level of
formal discipline (<em>vinaya</em>).</p>
<p>There are two aspects to keeping moral precepts or to practising
according to moral principles: self-discipline (in order to develop in
virtuous qualities) and a consideration of the benefits to others or to
society.</p>
<p>The former aspect is obvious throughout the Buddha’s teachings (the
suttas), while the latter aspect is strongly emphasized in the monks’
discipline (the Vinaya).</p>
<p>In relation to society, in the case that a monk’s actions were unskilful
and warranted the enactment of a training rule, the Buddha would call
the community of monks together, verify the truth from the instigator,
and explain the harm of such an action: that it does not generate faith
in the faithless nor does it increase faith in the faithful, but rather
it prevents faith from arising in those without faith and it shakes the
confidence of some of the faithful. Only then did he lay down the new
training rule and describe its advantages.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn89">89</a></sup></p>
<p>The concern here over people’s faith is a concern for the wellbeing and
happiness of the greater public. The wellbeing of society affects the
wellbeing of both the monastic community and of Buddhism as a whole,
because the stability of the monastic community and of the Buddhist
religion is dependent on the faith of the laity.</p>
<p>The faith of lay Buddhists stems from <em>pasāda</em>: confidence, inspiration,
joy, ease of heart, and a delight and enthusiasm for goodness. {920}
This quality is conducive to happiness, supports concentration, and is
favourable to wisdom, providing people with the necessary strength of
heart to understand a subject under investigation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn90">90</a></sup> This joy and
confidence is a fundamental source of wellbeing, enabling people to
progress in mental and wisdom development.</p>
<p>Before offering a teaching on the Four Noble Truths, the Buddha would
gradually prepare the listener’s state of mind and degree of
understanding, until the person’s mind was at ease, malleable, free from
the hindrances, delighted, and bright.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn91">91</a></sup></p>
<p>A monk should behave virtuously, not to seek personal gain from the
resulting devotion of the lay supporters, which would be reprehensible,
but rather for the wellbeing and happiness of the monastic community as
well as the wider lay community.</p>
<p>Unawakened monks must practise both aspects of moral behaviour –
combining assistance to others with self-discipline and self-training.
Arahants, on the other hand, who are completely free from mental
defilement and whose personal moral duties are thoroughly accomplished,
keep moral principles or abide by a moral code purely for the wellbeing
of the monastic community and of all human beings. This is consistent
with the vital principle vis-à-vis the conduct and activity by the
Buddha and his disciples: <em>To practise for the welfare and happiness of
the manyfolk, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare
and happiness of gods and humans</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn92">92</a></sup> as well as the principle of
being considerate of later generations, of setting a good example, and
of promoting goodness in the world by honouring the Dhamma and the
Vinaya.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn93">93</a></sup></p>
<p>For this reason, awakened persons observe moral precepts strictly. It is
not in their nature to claim that they are free from defilement,
carefree and detached, and therefore do not need to keep particular
training rules and can act in any manner they please.</p>
<p>Arahants do not only keep moral precepts, but some also uphold numerous
observances (<em>vatta</em>) associated with specific ascetic practices
(<em>dhutaṅga vata</em>), which are not required by the Vinaya, in order to
abide happily in the present and to assist later generations by acting
as a good example.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn94">94</a></sup> {921}</p>
<p>When one investigates the mental fetter of ‘adherence to rules and
religious practices’ (<em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>) one should not overlook a
person’s reasons and intentions that are connected to virtue and to
benefitting the community. If a person observes moral precepts, duties,
customs, and traditional ceremonies with an understanding and an
intention of acting in a well-mannered and exemplary fashion, this
action helps unite a community and elevates the Dhamma. If a person acts
appropriate to the circumstances, in accord with good intentions, and
not in a disingenuous way, one should not be in a hurry to criticize
this behaviour.</p>
<p>Where the behaviour in regard to rules, observances, customs,
ceremonies, and moral codes is incorrect, is by holding to them in a
gullible way and simply imitating others, without recognizing their
purpose, to the point that one mistakenly believes that purity or the
final spiritual goal is reached by simply keeping precepts or observing
customs and traditions. Such behaviour leads to a distortion of these
precepts and practices, deviating from the Buddhist path.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn95">95</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, people may uphold moral precepts and religious practices with
concealed craving and fixed views, by seeking a reward of material gain,
fame, praise, delight, or rebirth in heaven, and by reinforcing a sense
of self-identity, until the true purpose of moral conduct is obscured
and the way to reaching the goal of Dhamma practice is obstructed; or
people may keep moral precepts and follow various observances, customs,
and ceremonies in an unworthy, corrupt way: they get carried away and
overly impressed by their own good deeds, which become a source of pride
and conceit. (See
Note <a href="#note-untrue-man">An ‘Untrue Man’</a>)</p>
<p>A person who keeps moral precepts and follows the Vinaya should
understand the objectives – the intended benefits – of the Vinaya,
which the Buddha stated each time that he laid down a training rule.
There are ten such benefits:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Pertaining to communal wellbeing:</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.</strong> For the goodness that comes from a harmonious sangha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.</strong> For the wellbeing of the sangha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.</strong> For the control of shameless individuals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Pertaining to individual wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4.</strong> For the comfort of virtuous bhikkhus. {922}</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Pertaining to growth in the Dhamma:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.</strong> For the prevention of danger and trouble in the present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>6.</strong> For the prevention of danger and trouble in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Pertaining to social wellbeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>7.</strong> To arouse faith in those who lack faith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>8.</strong> To increase faith in the faithful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Pertaining to the wellbeing of Buddhism:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>9.</strong> For the stability of the True Dhamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10.</strong> To promote discipline and to support the Vinaya.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn96">96</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The Aṅguttara Nikāya contains another list of objectives for the
establishment of the training rules, which includes the following two
factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the benefit of the lay followers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To sever relations with those factions of bhikkhus who are evilly
disposed.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn97">97</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">An ‘Untrue Man’</span><a id="note-untrue-man"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example: a person may be of great learning (<em>bahussuta</em>), an
expert in the disciplinary code, or a skilled Dhamma preacher, or he
keeps the austere practices of living in the forest, wearing
rag-robes, living at the foot of a tree, or eating only one meal a
day, or he has attained <em>jhāna</em>, and as a result becomes proud and
disparages others; the Buddha called such a person an ‘untrue man’
(<em>asappurisa</em>): M. III. 39-42; a person who is accomplished in moral
conduct but becomes proud and boastful is called a heedless person
(M. I. 193-4); a person possessing exceptional qualities or virtues
should not allow them to be a cause for arrogance and disparagement of
others (e.g.: M. I. 272-3; D. III. 224-5 = A. II. 27-8; Nd. II. 59).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These objectives reveal an emphasis on communal welfare and happiness.
Similarly, the rules in the Vinaya dealing with the implementation of
formal acts of the community (<em>saṅgha-kamma</em>) attest to the importance
given to community affairs, by focusing on the cooperation and concerted
efforts of the monks.</p>
<p>Formal acts of the sangha only proceed well, however, if the community
is in harmony and undivided. This is a principal reason why the Buddha
reiterated the significance of sangha harmony as opposed to sangha
discord, by stating that the arising of harmony in the sangha is
conducive to the welfare and happiness of all people, whereas schisms in
the sangha have the opposite effect.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn98">98</a></sup></p>
<p>The various rules and regulations laid down by the Buddha in the Vinaya
express a spirit of communal wellbeing and dignity which is applicable
to all human relationships, an example of which is the common practice
of monks paying respects to one another.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#means-for-extolling-the-dhamma-and-enhancing-communal-welfare" id="means-for-extolling-the-dhamma-and-enhancing-communal-welfare">Means for Extolling the Dhamma and Enhancing Communal Welfare</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#bowing-and-paying-respects" id="bowing-and-paying-respects">Bowing and Paying Respects</a></h3>
<p>It is well known that in Buddhist communities the lay followers bow and
pay respects to the bhikkhus. Within the community of monks itself,
gestures of respect are made according to the number of years an
individual has been ordained. A monk who has been ordained for fewer
years pays respects to a monk who has been ordained longer.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn99">99</a></sup> {923}</p>
<p>In terms of internal spiritual qualities, a lay person who is a ‘noble
being’ (<em>ariya-puggala</em>) and has attained to a level of awakening still
bows to a monk who is unenlightened. (See
Note <a href="#note-attained-laypeople">Attained Laypeople</a>) In the monastic community, a fully
awakened monk – an arahant – still pays respects to an unawakened monk
if the latter monk has been ordained for a longer period of time.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Attained Laypeople</span><a id="note-attained-laypeople"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible for a layperson to attain arahantship, but according to
the Milindapañhā such a person will only continue as a layperson for
one day because he will either enter the monastic community as a
bhikkhu or else pass away (<em>parinibbāna</em>) on that day (Miln.:
Chaṭṭhavaggo, Gahīarahattapañho tatiyo). The Milindapañhā explains the
reason why it is appropriate for a layperson who is a stream-enterer
to pay respects to a monk who is unenlightened, but it does not
mention laypersons who have attained to a higher level of awakening.</p>
<p>In any case, there are examples in the Tipiṭaka, for example the story
of the householder Citta, who was a non-returner and who paid respects
to Ven. Sudhamma who was harbouring ill thoughts towards him (Vin. II.
16-17). The commentaries at SnA. I. 277 cite the Buddha’s teaching:
<em>Bhikkhus, if he is a layman, a non-returner should bow and pay
respects to a novice monk, even though he was ordained that very day.</em>
Although I have not found this passage in the Tipiṭaka, it accords in
principle with the aforementioned teachings.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This distinctive way of paying respects in the sangha is not a matter of
proving a person’s value based on prestige or external authority, or
even on internal spiritual attributes. The policies and customs
regarding bowing and the offering of respects exist for order and
simplicity, and for the wellbeing and harmony of the community. Communal
harmony and peace fall under the term Dhamma: virtue or righteousness
(as an aspect of truth). By following these customs of paying respects,
one acts for the wellbeing and integrity of the community; moreover, one
cultivates goodness and venerates the Dhamma.</p>
<p>Awakened persons, especially arahants, have no attachment to a sense of
self, which would lead them to take such customs of paying respects as a
gauge for a person’s value or as a means for self-aggrandizement. They
follow these well-established customs, aiming for the wellbeing of the
community, for the veneration and respect of the Dhamma and Vinaya, and
even for the assistance of the person to whom they pay respects (see
Note <a href="#note-honouring">Honouring the Dhamma</a>). If that person is morally inferior but
still contains some goodness, this act of respect will remind him to be
careful, to improve himself, and to strive for higher virtues.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Honouring the Dhamma</span><a id="note-honouring"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Buddha said that to whomever he teaches the Dhamma, even to a
beggar or a poor hunter, he teaches with respect for that person (with
commitment, by giving that person importance, and by truly wishing for
his or her welfare); this is because the Buddha venerates the Dhamma
(see: A. III. 121-2). When, according to tradition or to a person’s
status, people are polite and respectful, they should consider these
teachings on honouring the Dhamma in order to avoid problems from
acting out of say arrogance or flattery. (An exaggerated,
inappropriate, or insincere display of respect is equally a dishonour
of the Dhamma, similar to not showing respect or showing no deference
to tradition due to conceit.)</p>
<p>By honouring the Dhamma people in fact honour each other, by honouring
each other’s humanity, ability to be trained, and inherent virtues.
Respectfulness and the showing of respect, however, are two separate
factors: respectfulness is an internal attribute, while the showing of
respect is an external, social action. The latter accompanies and
supplements the former to help in a social context. The ways to show
respect and honour are determined by a community or society in order
to bring about mutual benefits, for example peace and orderliness.
These means of showing respect are also a way to honour the Dhamma, by
aiming for the establishment of truth in society. (In these
circumstances, a person who receives gestures of respect should pay
respect in return, by being considerate and attentive to the other
person who shows respect.)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>And in the case that awakened persons refrain from paying respects in
particular circumstances, they will do this for a reason, by aiming for
the benefit of that person or of the community, not because of mental
defilement and conceit. {924}</p>
<p>Awakened laypersons pay respects to monks – even those who are
unenlightened – for reasons connected to the truth or as a way to
venerate the truth, as can be summarized as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn100">100</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Monks relinquish the householder’s life, which is normally a life of
seeking pleasure and sensual gratification. They voluntarily remove
themselves from comfort and material abundance. They follow rules of
training and keep a discipline which is difficult for unenlightened
people to observe. Even the awakened laypeople are not compelled to
practise at this level of austerity; they recognize that the monks
do that which is difficult to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monks maintain a way of life that is considered by Buddhists to be a
way of self-development and a way of bringing wellbeing and
happiness to the world. This way of life should be honoured and
praised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monks are part of the monastic sangha: they are members of a
community whose duties are directly related to the Dhamma. The
monastic sangha is where virtuous people gather, where most of the
members are of a virtuous nature, and which is an optimal
environment for cultivating goodness. It is a symbol of the Dhamma
or of the stability of the Dhamma. Each individual bhikkhu
represents the monastic sangha; when one pays respects to a monk in
this sense (not to a specific personality), one is honouring the
sangha and venerating the Dhamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bhikkhu sangha is a Buddhist assembly performing the duties of
studying, practising, and propagating the Dhamma in an optimal and
most effective way. It safeguards the Dhamma (the Buddhist
teachings) and the Vinaya (the system of training), and it assists
in the transmission of the Buddhist religion. Monks are considered
the heirs of the Buddhist teachings. The paying of respects to monks
as representatives of the sangha is equivalent to supporting the
monastic community in order for it to provide blessings and
happiness to the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the very least, awakened laypeople pay respects to monks with a
mind of lovingkindness. They wish for the monks’ welfare, happiness,
and prosperity in the Dhamma, by helping them to remember and take
into account their individual position and their responsibilities,
which need to be attended to with diligent, sustained effort.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn101">101</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A monk or novice who makes effort and trains himself, although he is
still unenlightened, is still worthy of respectful salutations from
laypeople even if they are awakened. In other words, if a monk or novice
asks himself whether he possesses virtues worthy of the laypeople’s
veneration, this very self-awareness and self-inquiry is worthy of
respect.</p>
<p>The paying of respects between monks according to seniority is separate
from the formal acts of the monastic community (<em>saṅghakamma</em>), which
are accomplished by a formal resolution among community members and
conducted by an astute and able bhikkhu. (See
Note <a href="#note-astute">Astute and Able Monks</a>) {925} For such formal acts, the monks should
unanimously designate a leader who possesses trustworthy and admirable
personal qualities (<em>pasādanīya-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn102">102</a></sup> A monk who has been
ordained for a long time and has much experience is a more suitable
candidate for this position than a monk who has been ordained more
recently, because the elder monk has had more time to study, train, and
develop himself, but seniority is not the decisive factor in this
selection.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Astute and Able Monks</span><a id="note-astute"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ‘astute and able’ (<em>byatta paṭibala</em>) monk is given the position
of chanting the formal announcement (<em>kamma-vācā</em>): he announces the
matter at hand to the community, states the formal proposal (<em>ñatti</em>),
asks for a consensus, and announces the consensus. (In an ordination
ceremony there are two such senior monks, who are called
<em>kamma-vācācariya</em>.)</p>
<p>Today, many people are unfamiliar with the meaning and importance of
this position, because formal acts of the sangha have become more
ceremonial and set by tradition. On various formal acts of the sangha,
see for example: ordinations (Vin. I. 56-7; Vin. II. 273); observance
days (Vin. I. 102); establishing a formal boundary (<em>sīmā</em>) – Vin. I.
106; the Pavāraṇā ceremony (Vin. I. 159); the Kaṭhina ceremony
(Vin. I. 254); assigning monks to formal positions in the sangha
(Vin. I. 283-5; Vin. II. 167, 176-7); imposing penalties (e.g.:
Vin. II. 2, 7-8, 13, 18, 21, 125); settling disputes (Vin. II. 84,
87); and meeting for a formal recitation of the teachings (Vin. II.
285-6).</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#the-prescription-forbidding-monks-from-claiming-superhuman-states" id="the-prescription-forbidding-monks-from-claiming-superhuman-states">The Prescription Forbidding Monks from Claiming Superhuman States</a></h3>
<p>Another rule in the Vinaya that demonstrates the spirit of fostering the
collective good and emphasizes the importance of the community is the
rule forbidding monks from claiming exceptional spiritual qualities or
from claiming to have realized superhuman states
(<em>uttarimanussa-dhamma</em>), like deep states of concentration, jhāna,
concentrative attainments (<em>samāpatti</em>), or stages of enlightenment. If
a person falsely claims to possess these qualities with the intention to
deceive, he commits a <em>pārājika</em> offence and automatically falls away
from the state of being a bhikkhu.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn103">103</a></sup> Even if he has realized one of
these exceptional states, if he mentions this attainment to a layperson
or to someone else who is not a bhikkhu or bhikkhuni, he is still at
fault and transgresses a less serious rule requiring expiation
(<em>pācittiya</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn104">104</a></sup></p>
<p>The former rule originated during a time of famine, when a group of
monks who were looking for ways to obtain food without difficulty
decided to praise one another’s personal qualities, sometimes based on
fact and sometimes not, by saying, for example: ‘This monk has attained
jhāna’, ‘This monk is a stream-enterer’, ‘This monk is an arahant’,
‘This monk has attained the six higher psychic attainments.’ As a result
the devoted laypeople provided them with abundant food. When the Buddha
was made aware of this he laid down the training rule, saying that it is
undignified to boast about one’s exceptional qualities for the sake of
one’s stomach, and he severely criticized those monks who made false
claims, calling them the most contemptible thieves in the world.</p>
<p>A similar rule forbids monks from displaying psychic powers to
laypeople. A monk who transgresses this rule commits an offence of
wrongdoing (<em>dukkaṭa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn105">105</a></sup> This rule originated when a wealthy
merchant hung a sandalwood bowl from the end of a long bamboo pole and
declared a challenge: he would give this bowl to anyone who is an
arahant and possesses true psychic powers, but this person must levitate
and collect the bowl himself. Ven. Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja heard of this
challenge and wanting to preserve the honour of Buddhism rose in the air
and collected the bowl, causing great excitement and wonder among the
inhabitants of Rājagaha. {926} The Buddha then laid down a training
rule, reproaching Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja for displaying psychic powers in
exchange for a relatively worthless bowl, comparing this action with a
woman who exposes herself for a mere coin.</p>
<p>Before laying down these training rules, the Buddha mentioned that it is
inappropriate to boast about one’s merits, skills, and special abilities
for the sake of material gain, veneration, or personal advantage. And
when he laid down and defined the actual rule, he stated that it is a
transgression to boast about or display one’s merits and abilities for
any reason, not limited to seeking personal profit and veneration.</p>
<p>There are deeper objectives behind the Buddha’s conduct here. For
example, the Buddha did not wish for people to become overly excited or
captivated by things they believe to be beyond their own reach, or to
entrust their hope to someone or something else to the point of
abandoning their own efforts within the range of their ability.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn106">106</a></sup></p>
<p>The objective to discuss here is connected to the monastic sangha.
According to the Buddhist teachings, the survival of the Dhammavinaya is
dependent on the monastic sangha as a whole. The transmission of the
teachings and the protection of the Dhammavinaya relies on the stability
of the monastic sangha. The Buddha entrusted the Dhammavinaya to the
monastic sangha rather than to a specific individual; were the latter
case true, the teachings would not have lasted long.</p>
<p>The Buddha wished for the laypeople to support and relate to the monks
as a community, and to support individual monks in an impersonal way, as
representatives of the monastic sangha. Although an individual monk or
group of monks may have some exceptional proficiency or may have reached
an outstanding spiritual realization, their relationship to the laity
has a direct bearing on the entire monastic community, allowing other
members of the monastic community to partake in their achievements.</p>
<p>This is easily discernible in the case where a monk possesses special
virtues or abilities. The advantages an individual monk with special
merits or abilities receives also extend to the entire community, which
flourishes along with that individual. On the other hand, if that
monks’s merits or abilities are personalized, as belonging to a specific
individual or associated with a particular group, only that individual
or group will prosper while the greater sangha will be depreciated.</p>
<p>When a monk broadcasts his own exceptional qualities, laypeople tend to
focus their attention and lavish their support on him. At the same time
the monastic sangha as a whole declines in importance, receives less
attention, and is weakened as a result.</p>
<p>This is the reason why some arahants at the time of the Buddha, when
their exceptional abilities became known publicly so that people became
attached to them as an individual and gave them personal donations, and
they became a focus of attention to the extent that the importance of
the monastic community as a whole waned, would quickly leave that
locality.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn107">107</a></sup> {927}</p>
<p>For monks to boast about or proclaim their exceptional spiritual
qualities to laypeople, regardless of whether these claims are true or
false, have the following harmful consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It causes the laypeople to become preoccupied and focused on an
individual person or group rather than taking an interest in the
wider monastic community. Laypeople who lack an understanding will
judge and compare people, praising some while disparaging others,
based sometimes on truth and sometimes not. This can cause harm to
themselves and to the wider Buddhist community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If such proclamations were acceptable, it would not only be those
individuals with righteous attainments who would proclaim; those
individuals who misjudge their own attainments would also proclaim.
But even more serious, it would offer a chance for shameless
individuals to cause trouble by boasting. Those laypeople who lack
knowledge and experience of these matters are unable to distinguish
between what is true and what is false. They may be misled by
skilled charlatans and consequently view something false as
marvellous and reliable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unawakened laypeople possess varying preferences and interests, and
those monks who have realized exceptional spiritual qualities may
have personality traits or abilities that are incompatible with the
laypeople’s wishes. Not all spiritually attained people are endowed
with the skills and attributes to act as leaders while following in
the footsteps of the Buddha. Some realized monks are unable to
explain and to teach, similar to the ‘silent Buddhas’
(<em>pacceka-buddha</em>), and they are sometimes no match for erudite
unawakened teachers. This is similar to a person who has travelled
to a distant land, but on returning is unable to give a captivating,
persuasive description of his travels. Another person who has never
been to this land, however, may be able to give a vivid, dramatic
account, like some geography professors who are adept at teaching
about foreign countries despite having never stepped foot there.</p>
<p>In terms of personal attributes, some monks have realized the fruits
of awakening but have an unattractive physical appearance. Ven.
Lakuṇṭaka-Bhaddiya, for example, was an arahant but was both dwarfed
and hunch-backed; the young monks and novices would tease and
ridicule him so much that the Buddha needed to come to his
aid.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn108">108</a></sup> If such a person proclaims his spiritual achievements he
may lead people to refute these achievements or to view Buddhism in
a negative light. A deceptive, unawakened person, however, may lead
a great number of people down an incorrect path due to his being
charismatic and articulate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If realized beings skilled at teaching, realized beings unskilled at
teaching, unrealized beings who overestimate their achievements, and
people who are charlatans were all to proclaim their spiritual
attainments, the Buddhist teachings would become mixed up and
muddled; people would not know which teachings are correct and which
are false. Some people possess a true knowledge of some aspects of
their experience, but their attempts to describe the realization are
at odds with its essential meaning because they lack a formal study
of the teachings, which leads to confusion, misunderstandings, and a
disunity of the Buddhist teachings.</p>
<p>The confirmation of enlightenment is the responsibility and
imperative of the Buddha, who established the Buddhist religion and
protected both the teachings and the disciples. Confirmation and
endorsement rests with the Buddha and his teachings; later disciples
voluntarily accept these teachings. The responsibility of disciples
does not require referring to personal spiritual attainments but
rather consists of remaining true to the Buddha’s teaching.</p>
<p>True disciples of the Buddha try not to deviate from the Buddha’s
own teaching and they use consistency with the Buddha’s teachings as
the basic criteria for correct transmission of the teachings. They
need not refer to their own awakening as a criteria for evaluation.
This preserves the integrity of the teachings and of Buddhism. {928}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a person proclaims exceptional spiritual qualities, faithful
lay supporters will bring material gifts and offerings. These gifts
are due to that person’s proclamation, and thus according to the
Vinaya they are ‘impure gains’.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is of the nature of awakened beings to refrain from speaking about or
proclaiming their spiritual attainments. A person who boasts of being an
awakened person, reveals precisely the opposite: of not being awakened.
The only people who proclaim exceptional spiritual qualities that they
truly possesses are unawakened people with mundane spiritual attainments
like concentrative attainments (<em>jhāna-samāpatti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn109">109</a></sup></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#offerings-to-the-monastic-community" id="offerings-to-the-monastic-community">Offerings to the Monastic Community</a></h3>
<p>This subject of revealing one’s personal attainments is connected to the
tradition of making offerings to the monastic community (<em>saṅgha-dāna</em>).
Buddhism distinguishes between two kinds of donations (<em>dāna</em>):
donations made to a specific individual (<em>pāṭipuggalika-dāna</em>) and
donations made to the entire monastic community (<em>saṅgha-dāna</em>).</p>
<p>The Buddhist teachings state that offerings made to someone with little
virtue bear relatively little fruit, while offerings made to a highly
virtuous person bear great fruit. Offerings made to the community,
however, are more fruitful than offerings made to any individual.</p>
<p>The Buddha categorized offerings made to individuals, from high to low:
gifts to the Buddha, gifts to ‘silent Buddhas’ (<em>paccekabuddha</em>), gifts
to arahants, once-returners, etc., all the way to gifts made to virtuous
unawakened persons, immoral persons, and animals. And he used this
comparison: a gift to animals may be expected to repay a hundredfold, a
gift to an immoral ordinary person may be expected to repay a
thousandfold, a gift to a virtuous ordinary person may be expected to
repay a hundred-thousandfold, a gift to a renunciant outside the
dispensation who is free from lust for sensual pleasures may be expected
to repay ten-thousand millionfold, a gift to a stream-enterer may be
expected to repay incalculably, immeasurably – what then should be said
about giving a gift to one whose virtues exceed this?</p>
<p>As stated above, however, offerings made to the community are more
fruitful than offerings made to any individual. The most complete
donation to the monastic community is offered to both the bhikkhus and
bhikkhunis with the Buddha at the head. Next are donations made to both
bhikkhu and bhikkhuni communities after the Buddha has passed away, and
then donations made to a predetermined number of monks and nuns (acting
as representatives for the wider community and not specifying particular
individuals’ names). Even in the future, when the Dhammavinaya has
almost perished, offerings made in the name of the sangha to immoral
monks who simply wear some brown cloth around their necks bears great
fruit. The Buddha concluded:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>I say that in no way does a gift to an individual person ever have
greater fruit than an offering made to the sangha.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn110">110</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. III. 254-6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>At one time the Buddha had the following conversation on this subject
with a householder:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> ‘Householder, are alms given by your family?’</p>
<p><em>Householder:</em> ‘Oh yes, lord, my family offers alms, and these alms
are given to such monks who keep the observances of dwelling in the
forest, eating only almsfood, and wearing rag-robes, who are arahants
or have realized the path of arahantship.’</p>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> ‘But surely you who are a layman, a householder, and a busy
family man, find it difficult to tell which monk is an arahant or has
realized the path of arahantship. {929} Regardless of whether a monk
dwells in the forest or in the village, whether a monk eats almsfood
or accepts meal invitations, whether a monk wears rag-robes or robes
offered by the laity, if he is distracted, proud, overconfident,
outspoken, foulmouthed, absent-minded, uncircumspect, irresolute,
agitated, and with senses unrestrained, he on that count is
blameworthy. But if he is not distracted, not proud, not
overconfident, not outspoken, not foul-mouthed, mindful, circumspect,
one-pointed, determined, and with senses restrained, he on that count
is praiseworthy.</p>
<p><em>A. III. 391.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha then encouraged the householder to make offerings to the
wider monastic community, saying that by making such offerings the mind
is joyful and bright, and when the mind is bright, at death one goes to
a happy abode.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn111">111</a></sup></p>
<p>Apart from focusing on self-training and self-development, the practice
and behaviour of the bhikkhus should take into consideration the
wellbeing of the monastic community and of all human beings. At the very
least, as a result of the monastic rules of disciple, the monks should
make those people whom they interact with feel safe, happy and at ease.
Furthermore, if possible, the monks should teach the Dhamma so that
people develop in faith, moral conduct, learning, generosity, and
wisdom.</p>
<p>In other words, the monks have two responsibilities in relation to the
laity: a responsibility in regard to the Vinaya – of gladdening the
minds of the laity by keeping moral precepts and observances – and a
responsibility in regard to the Dhamma – of imparting the truth and
sharing goodness in order to help the laity develop spiritually.</p>
<p>As for the laypeople, when they interact with the monks, they should aim
to acquire spiritual riches in order to advance in the way of truth, and
when they offer support to the monks, they should take into account the
benefits accrued to the wider monastic community. And in the case that
laypeople choose to interact with or make offerings to an individual
monk, they should do so with the wish that the monastic sangha be stable
and secure, and for the lasting welfare and happiness of all people.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#concluding-remarks-on-the-monastic-discipline" id="concluding-remarks-on-the-monastic-discipline">Concluding Remarks on the Monastic Discipline</a></h2>
<p>The prime moral objectives of the monastic code of discipline (<em>vinaya</em>)
can be summed up as follows: to honour the monastic community and its
activities; to emphasize the stability and wellbeing of the community;
and to develop a sense of responsibility towards the community. The
Buddha and his arahant disciples embodied the spirit of this teaching
and acted as paragons of virtue.</p>
<p>Responsible and supportive actions in regard to the sangha are correct
according to Dhamma and consistent with the Vinaya. Respect for the
sangha is thus connected to respect for both the Dhamma and the
Vinaya.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn112">112</a></sup></p>
<p>A sense of responsibility for the sangha is also connected to the
practice for benefiting all human beings, because the term ‘sangha’
literally means ‘community’ or ‘multitude’, and the monastic community
was established for the welfare and happiness of all people. {930}</p>
<p>The Buddha is a leading example in this way of practice as confirmed by
these passages:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Fully Awakened One, the Champion and
King of the Dhamma, relying on the Dhamma, respecting, honouring, and
revering the Dhamma, with the Dhamma as his standard, banner, and
sovereign, provides righteous protection, shelter and safety to the
bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, laymen, and laywomen, [by teaching] thus:
‘Such bodily action ... verbal action ... mental action ... livelihood
... dwelling in town or village should be undertaken and such
[action, etc.] should not be undertaken.’</p>
<p><em>A. III. 149-50; cf.: A. I. 109-10; Ps. II. 159-60.</em></p>
<p>I dwell honouring and respecting and depending on that very Dhamma to
which I have fully awakened. And whenever the sangha is possessed of
greatness, then I also have deep reverence for the sangha.</p>
<p><em>A. II. 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When the monastic community increased, became more widespread, and grew
in both knowledge and experience, the Buddha established various formal
acts of the sangha (<em>saṅghakamma</em>), by giving prominence and entrusting
authority to the collective community. In regard to ordinations, for
example, he ceased giving ordinations by himself or permitting
individual disciples to give ordinations, and rather had the sangha
perform this duty.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn113">113</a></sup></p>
<p>When Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī (the Buddha’s aunt and stepmother) brought a
set of new robes that she had sewn herself to offer to the Buddha, the
Buddha said to her: <em>Give to the sangha, Gotamī. When you give an
offering to the sangha, it will be made both to me and to the
sangha.</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn114">114</a></sup></p>
<p>Before the Buddha’s final passing away, he spoke thus to Ven. Ānanda:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Ānanda, the Dhamma and Vinaya that I have taught and assigned to all
of you, that, at my passing, will be your teacher.</p>
<p><em>D. II. 154.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>After the Buddha’s final passing away the brahman Vassakāra asked the
following question to Ven. Ānanda:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Is there, Master Ānanda, any single bhikkhu who was appointed by
Master Gotama thus: ‘He will be your refuge (’point of reference’,
‘anchor’) when I am gone’, and to whom you are now devoted?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Ven. Ānanda replied that there is no such individual, nor is there such
an individual who has been chosen by the sangha and appointed by a
number of elder bhikkhus before the Buddha’s final passing away.
Nevertheless: <em>We are not without a refuge, brahman. We have a refuge;
we have the Dhamma as our refuge</em>. And he went on to explain how the
Dhamma acts as a refuge:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Brahman, the Blessed One who knows and sees, who is accomplished and
fully enlightened, has prescribed the course of training and has laid
down the Pātimokkha. On the observance day as many of us as live in
dependence upon a single village district meet together in unison, and
when we meet we ask one who knows the Pātimokkha to recite it. If a
bhikkhu remembers an offence or a transgression while the Pātimokkha
is being recited, we impose a penalty on him according to the Dhamma
in the way we have been instructed. In this way, it is not the
venerable ones who correct us; it is the Dhamma that corrects us.
{931}</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Ven. Ānanda went on to say, however, that there are monks who are seen
as leaders and as a mainstay:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>There are, brahman, ten qualities inspiring confidence that have been
declared by the Blessed One who knows and sees, who is accomplished
and fully enlightened. When these qualities are found in anyone among
us, we honour, respect, revere, and venerate him, and live in
dependence on him, honouring and respecting him.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn115">115</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. III. 9-12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A monk who is appointed to adjudicate legal disputes must be one who
defers to the sangha rather than deferring to an individual, one who
honours the truth rather than honouring material objects.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn116">116</a></sup></p>
<p>It is incumbent on leading arahant disciples to act as role models in
giving importance to community activities. For example, there is the
story of the Buddha exhorting Ven. Mahākappina to attend the observance
day ceremony, in order for the monks to review their conduct in light of
the Vinaya, even though Mahākappina was an arahant and perfectly pure at
heart.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn117">117</a></sup> Similarly, although Ven. Mahākassapa lived in a remote
place about four kilometres from the place where the observance day
ceremony was held, he would walk on foot each fortnight to attend this
ceremony, even though it meant passing across a river.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn118">118</a></sup></p>
<p>Those monks who are arahants and non-returners, and who are able to
enter the ‘attainment of cessation’ (<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>), make the
following determination before entering that state: ‘If during the seven
days that I enter the state of cessation the sangha requires to perform
a formal act, for example a formal resolution (<em>ñatti-kamma</em>), I will
exit this state immediately, before another monk needs to invite me.’
This is because the authority of the community is vital and worthy of
respect.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn119">119</a></sup></p>
<p>When events or circumstances occur that affect the welfare of the
monastic community or have an impact on the growth or decline of the
Buddhist religion, the monks, especially the arahants, have an
obligation to pay attention and to get involved. For example, they
organize councils (or ‘recitations’: <em>saṅgāyanā</em>) to purify the sangha,
protect the teachings from deviation or from disrespectful, slanderous
people or ideologies, help the Buddhist religion survive in times of
danger, and to cultivate and support those individuals who are skilled
at safeguarding and promoting Buddhism.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn120">120</a></sup></p>
<p>If an individual neglects to participate in these sangha activities, the
sangha will impose a penalty on him even if he is an arahant and even if
the reason for neglect was to pursue a wholesome, blameless action like
dwelling in a concentrative attainment.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn121">121</a></sup> When the community imposes
a penalty, the person penalized has the opportunity to explain the
reasons for his actions, but if the sangha makes a final decision, the
person will honour this, as is seen in the case of Ven. Ānanda, who was
rebuked during the First Council.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn122">122</a></sup> {932}</p>
<p>It is also the tradition for members of the monastic community to pay
attention to minor activities requiring collective effort, like sewing
robes. Such collective effort is particularly important in matters
pertaining to formal acts of the sangha, for example in regard to the
Kaṭhina ceremony, during which the community agrees to offer a robe sewn
from donated cloth to an individual monk. Every monk in the community,
irrespective of a monk’s seniority or spiritual accomplishments, should
participate in sewing this cloth into a robe.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn123">123</a></sup></p>
<p>Communal responsibilities can be separated into two layers of
importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Minor communal affairs pertaining to specific circumstances, or
deeds of mutual assistance to be performed as companions in a single
community, which accord with the ‘factors leading to harmony’
(<em>sārāṇīya-dhamma</em>), in particular the factor of kindly assistance
and support (<em>mettā-kāyakamma</em>), for example by nursing each other
in times of illness, and the factor found in an alternative
presentation of this teaching, of a willingness to give a helping
hand (<em>kiṅkaraṇīyesu-dakkhatā</em>) – a diligence to help out in all
communal matters, big and small.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn124">124</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communal activities that have a bearing on the wellbeing and
stability of the entire community, or matters requiring joint
consideration and decision making, which accord with the ‘factors
leading to prosperity’ (<em>aparihāniya-dhamma</em>), especially the first
two factors: to hold regular and frequent meetings, and to meet in
harmony, adjourn in harmony, and conduct sangha business in
harmony.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn125">125</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In relation to the first matters (A), if a monk takes no heed and makes
no effort to help out, it is likely that he will be criticized and
censured by the community, and requested to come forward to explain his
actions and receive words of caution. This procedure, however, is
dependent on the circumstances and has exceptions. For instance there
may already be someone else specifically assigned to a task, there may
be sufficient people helping out, or the individual monk may have
important personal duties to attend to.</p>
<p>There is a story of a newly ordained monk who spent the afternoon
quietly in his kuti<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn126">126</a></sup> while the other monks were sewing robes. The
monks went to the Buddha and accused this monk of negligence. The Buddha
called this monk for questioning and when he found out that the monk had
been developing jhāna, he told the other monks to cease their
protest.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn127">127</a></sup> Similarly, there are occasions when the majority of the
community is caught up and disturbed about a communal issue, but respond
to it in a confused and fruitless fashion. Those monks who remain quiet
and detached in order to cultivate the Dhamma are considered to be
acting appropriately.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn128">128</a></sup></p>
<p>In relation to the second matters (B), there are no exceptions. When the
community gathers to conduct a formal activity (<em>saṅghakamma</em>), all
members of the community must be present. If a monk is ill or there is
another reason preventing him from attending, then he must give his
formal consent to the sangha.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn129">129</a></sup> {933}</p>
<p>In sorting out the details of these formal activities, however, the
monks should first consider and look to those individuals who are
directly involved or responsible for the matters at hand. The Buddha
stated that for one who is still in training it is a way of decline to
not acknowledge and defer to those experienced elders and instead to be
obstructive and troublesome when there is formal communal business to
attend to.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn130">130</a></sup></p>
<p>The guidelines of social ethics which are a part of the Vinaya consist
of a complete code of social conduct, designed to make communal
activities, the relationship to the outside world, and the whole
environment in which a person lives conducive to the growth and
prosperity of a person’s internal life. And in a complementary way, this
code of conduct promotes a spiritual life whose virtues will be
expressed outwardly, creating an atmosphere in which all people can
train themselves and develop virtuous conduct, concentration, and
wisdom, in order to discover true happiness, with a free and pure mind
and within a peaceful, ordered, and secure environment.</p>
<p>The Vinaya is a model example of morality on the level of a code of
discipline, which is a complete system of guiding social conduct for a
specific group of people, namely, the Buddhist monastic community.</p>
<p>The monastic discipline is not a set of moral principles in a restricted
or limited sense, but rather it incorporates all aspects of the monks’
social behaviour and conduct, including: designating the terms and
procedures for accepting new members into the community (along with
their privileges and responsibilities); caring for and training these
new members; appointing officials for specific communal activities;
determining the proper policy in regard to the search for, production,
storage, and distribution of the four requisites, for example the kinds
of allowable food, the receiving and sharing of food, the making of and
proper use of robes, the kinds of proper medicines, the procedure of
caring for sick monks (including responsibilities of both the nurse and
the patient), the allocation of dwellings, the duties of a resident in
these dwellings, the policy of building new dwellings, the design and
planning of new dwellings, and the management of building projects;
regulations for organizing community meetings; the way of dealing with
formal accusations; the proper conduct of a plaintiff, a defendant, and
the arbitrators of the case; the ways of executing and settling legal
disputes; and the imposition of various penalties.</p>
<p>The term <em>vinaya</em> refers to a comprehensive system of conduct, enabling
a specific group of people to be stable and secure, to live in a way
that accords with their principles, and to perform their activities in
an optimal way in order to arrive at their aspired goal.</p>
<p>If one uses modern terminology the <em>vinaya</em> is a system of conduct that
encompasses the entire range of governance, social management,
legislation, economics, and education (along with other areas of
responsibility), according to the formal agreements made by a group of
people (this can include an entire nation), by enacting a constitution,
charter, legal system, or set of edicts.</p>
<p>In Buddhism the term <em>vinaya</em> denotes a foundation of conduct that
supports the entire Buddhist way of life and promotes a favourable
practice along Buddhist principles. The bhikkhu Vinaya is an instrument
enabling the monastic community to be a source of prosperity and growth
for the monks and to provide them with the true benefits that the
Buddhist teachings have to offer. {934}</p>
<p>When the Vinaya exists, the monastic sangha exists. When the monastic
sangha exists, the benefits derived from the Buddhist way of life exist.
For this reason, a respect for the monastic community and its
activities, and a sense of responsibility in regard to its stability and
wellbeing, is a key objective to Buddhist social ethics.</p>
<p>The Buddha established a complete code of discipline – the Vinaya –
for the monastic community, which lies at the heart of the wider
Buddhist community. As for establishing an expanded, detailed code of
discipline for the wider Buddhist community, it is up to people in each
specific time period and set of circumstances to accomplish this task by
drawing on the spirit of the Vinaya, as King Asoka once tried to do.</p>
<p>When one understands the principle of morality (<em>sīla</em>) on the level of
a disciplinary code, one will be able to distinguish between morality as
Dhamma and morality as <em>vinaya</em>. The former is included in the term
‘Dhamma’, while the latter is the definition of the term <em>vinaya</em>. One
will also understand why the Buddha referred to Buddhism – the entire
Buddhist teachings – as ‘Dhammavinaya’, and why the Dhamma and the
Vinaya comprise the entire spectrum of Buddhism.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#definition-of-vinaya-beyond-the-scope-of-moral-precepts" id="definition-of-vinaya-beyond-the-scope-of-moral-precepts">Definition of Vinaya Beyond the Scope of Moral Precepts</a></h2>
<p>The discussion of <em>vinaya</em> above remains within the domain of moral
conduct (<em>sīla</em>) or is directly linked to moral conduct. The term
<em>vinaya</em>, however, has a wide range of meaning. An understanding of the
various nuances of this term helps to clarify the general Buddhist
perspective and framework.</p>
<p>There are two basic definitions for the term <em>vinaya</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The practice of conforming one’s behaviour and way of life to a
systematized code of conduct; the development of self-discipline in
order to follow an ethical code; the application of an ethical code
to determine one’s conduct, way of life, and communal activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A code of conduct, a set of precepts, or a set of regulations, which
are formulated as a principle or standard for training and
self-discipline, and which give order and excellence to a person’s
behaviour and to communal activities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Upon closer inspection one can distinguish five nuances of meaning
inherent within these two basic definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Training: training oneself, and encouraging others to train
themselves, in order for people’s conduct to be virtuous, correct,
disciplined, and systematic, and to bring about success and
fulfilment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discipline: care and supervision of people’s behaviour in order that
it accords with a code of conduct; applying a code of conduct as a
means to regulate people’s actions and communal activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declaration of rules and regulations (<em>nīti-paññāpana</em>): the
formulation and establishment of a code of conduct, rules and
precepts, laws and statutes, etc., to act as guidelines and a set of
criteria in training or regulating people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legislation (<em>nīti-paññatti</em>): the actual code of conduct, rules and
precepts, laws and statutes, etc. established for training or
regulating people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arbitration (<em>vinicchaya-karaṇa</em>): passing judgement in the case of
legal disputes, settling them according to an established code of
conduct, laws and statutes, etc., in order to maintain
righteousness, orderliness, and peace. {935}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of human social evolution, the Buddhist teachings state that
these systems of regulation arise out of necessity. When people live
together in large numbers, with each person seeking the four requisites
and consumable objects, it is natural that there arise quarrels,
conflict, and competition. As a result, someone is required to settle
these disputes, giving rise to supervision and governance.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn131">131</a></sup> For the
wellbeing of society, the chosen ruler or governor must establish rules
and guidelines for resolving any problems and regulating people’s
behaviour. A set of rules and laws are thus prescribed and legislation
is enacted. And when disputes arise, judgement is passed and punishment
meted out.</p>
<p>Originally, it was the sole duty of the ruler to lay down the law and
pass judgement in times of conflict. Later, as human societies developed
and became more complex, institutions and organizations were created to
help establish legislative and judicial systems and procedures, to carry
out these duties on behalf of the executive branch of government. Here,
we can see that even the court system and the administration of justice
is one aspect of the term <em>vinaya</em>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, social exigencies brought about the need for a
ruler, who was empowered with the right to judge legal disputes and lay
down rules and regulations. The purpose of these guidelines was to
foster social order, peace, and virtue, so that citizens could engage in
their livelihoods with minimum conflict and that society would be secure
and prosperous. If the society had a just ruler, whose honesty and
righteousness was trusted by the people, he would be referred to as a
‘righteous wheel-turning monarch’ (<em>cakkavatti dhammarājā</em>).</p>
<p>Although in such societies there existed something called ‘training’, it
was generally only for developing knowledge and aptitude in those arts
and sciences necessary for successfully engaging in a profession, in
order to meet the demands of that particular society.</p>
<p>An important contribution by Buddhism in this context of <em>vinaya</em> was a
change in how people are guided and managed. The regulation of people as
a consequence of the social exigencies mentioned above, supported
chiefly by a system of governance, is a means of controlling people
through obligation and compulsion. This form of control is inadequate
and not truly effective. One ought to also cultivate a sense of
self-discipline.</p>
<p>Human beings are capable of being trained; they are able to change from
bad to good, from coarse to refined. They have the ability to develop
the highest spiritual qualities, including virtuous conduct, inner
fortitude, happiness, and most importantly wisdom, which leads to the
realization of the ultimate truth. Human beings are the primary agents
in this dynamic; human society is formed by the intentional actions of
people themselves. For this reason, the essential discipline and
training should occur within each individual. {936}</p>
<p>A key feature of Buddhism is that the <em>vinaya</em> – the system of guidance
and management – emphasizes that people manage themselves, by
cultivating virtuous conduct, the mind, and wisdom. Those acting as
guides are viewed as ‘beautiful friends’ (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>), rather than
disciplinarians.</p>
<p>In Buddhism, the <em>vinaya</em> is seen primarily as a system of spiritual
training. For this training to proceed well and reach success, the other
aspects of <em>vinaya</em> are introduced as supports, including supervision,
administration, the laying down of rules and training precepts, and a
course of justice (including the settling of disputes).</p>
<p>This key system of training is reinforced by <em>vinaya</em> in the sense of
supervision, legislation, and arbitration, as described above.
Importantly, the Buddhist discipline does not rely chiefly on adhering
to rules and imposing punishments. The emphasis is on ‘training rules’
rather than ‘commandments’.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to a literal explanation of the term <em>vinaya</em>.
Traditionally, this term has been defined as ‘leading (to excellence)’.
It may also be translated as ‘guiding’ or ‘managing’. In particular,
this term refers to: managing individual people, so that they develop in
virtue, reach fulfilment, and are released from all suffering; managing
society, to bring about social peace and stability; and managing
miscellaneous affairs, so that they are accomplished well.</p>
<p>The adjectival form <em>vinīta</em> (past participle of the verb <em>vineti</em>) is
frequently used in the scriptures, primarily in reference to individuals
and groups of people. It may be translated as ‘led to excellence’ or
‘well-trained’. When used in reference to affairs or circumstances (e.g.
in the term <em>vinīta-vatthu</em>), it means that these things have been
carried out, concluded, and accomplished well.</p>
<p>The Buddha stated that he would defer his final passing away
(<em>parinibbāna</em>) until his disciples from the four assemblies were
well-trained (<em>vinīta</em>). In many commentarial passages the term <em>vinaya</em>
is explained as the threefold training (<em>tisso sikkhā</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-establishing">Establishing the Dhamma-Vinaya</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Establishing the Dhamma-Vinaya</span><a id="note-establishing"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Evil One, I will not take final Nibbāna till I have monks and
disciples who are astute, well-trained, learned, fearless, knowers
of the Dhamma, trained in conformity with the Dhamma....</em></p>
<p><em>Na tāvāhaṃ pāpima parinibbāyissāmi yāva me bhikkhū na sāvakā

<p><em>D. II. 104-105.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several commentaries contain the following explanation: ‘It is called
Dhamma in the sense that it is a natural truth (<em>sabhāva</em>); it is
called <em>vinaya</em> in the sense that it ought to be practised’: NdA.
[143]; PsA. II. 505; VbhA. [348].</p>
<p>One commentarial passage states: ‘<em>Vinaya</em> is the threefold training’
(<em>vinayo sikkhattayaṃ</em> – Vibhaṅga Mūlaṭīkā: Jhānavibhaṅgo,
Suttantabhājanīyaṃ, Niddesavaṇṇanā).</p>
<p>Another passage states: ‘One is not well-trained (<em>vinīta</em>) when one
has not trained in the higher moral training, etc.’: Majjhima Nikāya
Ṭīkā: Mūlapaṇṇāsaṭīkā, Mūlapariyāyavaggo, Suttanikkhepavaṇṇanā.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The meaning of the term <em>vinaya</em> is made clearer when it is compared
with the word <em>dhamma</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dhamma</em> refers to essential truths and principles, ranging from laws of
nature to principles of conduct comprising the holy life
(<em>brahmacariya</em>). The <em>vinaya</em> is a way of applying these truths and
principles, giving substantial form to the conduct and behaviour of the
holy life, and enabling this behaviour to spread outwards into the wider
world.</p>
<p>In other words, <em>vinaya</em> acts as an instrument for the Dhamma,
regulating how a community or society functions in accord with the
principles and objectives of the Dhamma; it helps to systematize the
holy life.</p>
<p>The Dhamma focuses on the essence of the teachings and emphasizes the
individual; <em>vinaya</em> focuses on form and emphasizes a system of
practice. {937}</p>
<p>If people overlook the deeper meaning of <em>vinaya</em>, do not apply the
social principles inherent in the concept of the <em>vinaya</em> and do not
apply the spirit of this concept to their everyday life – do not
formulate a systematic code of conduct that is based on Buddhist values
and appropriate to the present time, follow it strictly and share it
with others, and do not seek the essence of the Dhamma – it is
reasonable to expect the following dire consequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The domain of Buddhist practice or the sphere of a Buddhist way of
life will become more constricted and limited. The Buddhist
community will not advance; on the contrary, it will be on the
defensive and retreat far from the rest of human society, as if
fleeing to an island surrounded by rising tides, cut off from the
rest of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The social circumstances, especially the overall state of society,
will change according to outside power and influences, with
Buddhists having almost no participation in the creation and
management of social affairs. When social circumstances change in
ways unsupportive to Buddhist practice, they will have a direct
impact on Buddhism, perhaps even reaching the stage where Buddhist
practice is impossible. If this happens, Buddhists will have
themselves to blame for their carelessness and neglect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The ancient traditions in Thailand related to ordination – of having
boys and young men be ordained as novices and monks to receive an
education in the monastery, and the belief that a man must first be
ordained as a rite of passage before he gets married and starts a family
of his own – are examples of establishing a moral code (<em>vinaya</em>) and a
Buddhist social system, which helped greatly for Buddhism to thrive and
become widespread in Thai society. The deterioration of these traditions
has had obvious adverse effects on Buddhism in Thailand.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn132">132</a></sup></p>
<p>If Buddhists do not understand the essence of the term <em>vinaya</em> and the
true objective of Buddhist social ethics, not only will the spirit of
moral training not extend out and be integrated into the practice of lay
Buddhists, but even the essential function of the monastic Vinaya will
fade away, leaving only a set of empty rituals.</p>
<p>If one is to restore the proper application of moral discipline
(<em>vinaya</em>), a mere emphasis on strictness of form is inadequate. An
essential task, which has not been carried over from the past and has
been reduced in importance, is to restore and revive the spirit of
social ethics inherent in the monastic Vinaya. Moreover, Buddhists
should extend this spirit of social ethics outwards and apply it to the
spiritual practice of the lay community, establishing a Buddhist code of
conduct and social system that is appropriate to today’s day and age.</p>

<p>The Dhamma refers to the absolute truth, which exists according to its
own nature. The Buddha discovered this truth and revealed it to others.
Generally, the Pali term <em>dhamma-desanā</em> is used in this context,
meaning ‘exposition of the Dhamma’ or ‘Dhamma teaching’. (The term
<em>dhamma-paññatti</em> appears once in the Tipiṭaka, but its meaning is the
same as <em>dhamma-desanā</em>, or it refers to presenting or arranging the
Dhamma in order to make it more easily understood.)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn133">133</a></sup></p>
<p>The Vinaya is a code of regulations formulated and laid down by the
Buddha for the specific purpose of assisting the monastic order
(<em>saṅgha</em>) which he had established. (The Vinaya is directly connected
to the Dhamma: it exists in order for the sangha to benefit from the
Dhamma or to arrive at the Dhamma in the best possible way.) In this
context, the term <em>vinaya-paññatti</em> is used, meaning to lay down the
Vinaya, or it refers to the regulations that comprise the Vinaya. (The
term <em>vinaya-desanā</em> is used occasionally in the scriptures,
increasingly in the later texts, and has the specific meaning of Vinaya
terminology or the method of formulating the Vinaya.)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn134">134</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the term <em>paññatti</em> is occasionally used in the context of the
Dhamma,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn135">135</a></sup> it refers simply to formulating, arranging, classifying,
and grouping the truth in order to clarify it – to make it easier to
understand and to practise; it is not a matter of laying down new
clauses as in the context of the Vinaya.</p>
<p>Note that in regard to the Buddha’s utterance in the Mahāparinibbāna
Sutta: <em>Mayā dhammo ca vinayo desito paññatto</em>, the commentators
translate this passage as: ‘The Dhamma that has been taught and
formulated and the Vinaya that has been taught and formulated.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn136">136</a></sup>
The terms ‘taught’ and ‘formulated’ here should be understood and
distinguished according to the explanations above.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-2-sīla-vinaya-and-sīla-dhamma" id="appendix-2-sīla-vinaya-and-sīla-dhamma">Appendix 2: Sīla, Vinaya, and Sīla-dhamma</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(Trans.: this appendix combines material from appendix 2 of chapter
19 and appendix 3 of chapter 11 of the Thai edition of
<em>Buddhadhamma</em>.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moral principles (<em>sīla</em>) not specifically outlined and included in a
moral discipline (<em>vinaya</em>) can be defined as ‘Dhamma on the level of
morality’. This should not be confused with the Thai term <em>sīla-dhamma</em>
(ศีลธรรม), which has a distinct meaning limited to morality and virtue.
In this term, <em>sīla</em> refers to the refraining from doing bad or from
transgressing precepts, and <em>dhamma</em> refers to virtuous conduct or
teachings promoting virtue. According to the Buddhist teachings, the
entire practice of Dhamma is divided into the three stages of training
(<em>tisso sikkhā</em>): virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>), concentration (<em>samādhi</em>),
and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). <em>Sīla</em>, <em>samādhi</em>, and <em>paññā</em> are all aspects of
Dhamma, and therefore there is Dhamma on the level of virtuous conduct,
Dhamma on the level of concentration, and Dhamma on the level of wisdom.</p>
<p>Some people try to expand the definition of <em>sīla-dhamma</em>, for example
by interpreting it as <em>sīla</em> &amp; <em>dhamma</em>, which in effect encompasses the
entire Buddhist teachings, but this is generally not accepted by
Buddhist scholars. Most Thai people, when thinking of the term
<em>sīla-dhamma</em>, do not think of concentration, the Four Factors of
Mindfulness, insight meditation on the three characteristics, etc. The
expansion of this term’s definition is therefore limited to academic
studies. (One can broaden the definition as ‘virtuous conduct as well as
other qualities’, including concentration and wisdom. Alternatively, one
can equate <em>sīla</em> here with <em>vinaya</em>: <em>sīla-dhamma</em> thus means ‘<em>vinaya</em>
and <em>dhamma</em>’, corresponding to the original term ‘Dhammavinaya’.)</p>
<p>As far as this term is generally understood, however, <em>sīla-dhamma</em>
refers to ‘Dhamma on the level of morality’. In the dictionary of the
Royal Institute, <em>sīla-dhamma</em> is defined simply as ‘virtuous conduct’.
To whichever extent the meaning of this term is expanded it lies within
the confines of the ten wholesome courses of action
(<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>), otherwise known as the ways of righteous conduct
(<em>dhamma-cariyā</em>). Indeed, the term ‘righteous conduct’
(<em>dhamma-cariyā</em>) is a suitable substitute for ‘virtuous conduct’
(<em>sīla</em>; <em>sīla-dhamma</em>). (Note that although the two words constituting
the term <em>sīla-dhamma</em> are etymologically linked to Pali and Sanskrit,
the use of this compound is only found in the Thai language.)</p>
<p>A simple definition one sometimes finds for <em>sīla</em> is ‘a set of
prohibitions’. This ‘negative’ definition came about as a way to explain
the meaning of <em>sīla</em> on a basic level, but to stick to this as the only
definition is both limiting and incorrect. Indeed, even <em>sīla</em> as a code
of discipline (<em>vinaya</em>), for example the bhikkhu Vinaya, contains both
prohibitions and directives for ‘positive’ action: to gather for formal
community meetings, to undertake communal responsibilities (e.g. the
duties of a monk in charge of food distribution), to act with humility
and respect, to endeavour to be of service to others, etc.; these are
all matters of <em>sīla</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn137">137</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the discussion of virtuous conduct often overlooks the
matter of earning a livelihood, which is a vital part of <em>sīla</em>. To
avoid an overly narrow understanding of <em>sīla</em>, one should develop a
more comprehensive view, including right speech, right action, and right
livelihood.</p>

explained, the ten ways of righteous conduct are mentioned instead of
the precepts. In the commentaries and later texts the term is abundantly
used.</p>
<p>In the Tipiṭaka, the more common references to the five precepts include
the terms ‘five virtues’ (<em>pañca-dhamma</em>) and five ‘training rules’
(<em>sikkhāpada</em>), or else the five precepts are mentioned without a
heading. Further references to the five precepts include: ‘bright
qualities’ (<em>sukka-dhamma</em>), ‘an absence of fearful retribution’, and a
defining quality of a layperson’s morality.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn138">138</a></sup> The five precepts are
also included as part of the ‘householder’s observances’ (<em>gihi-vatta</em>
or <em>gahaṭṭa-vatta</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn139">139</a></sup></p>
<p>Regarding the ten wholesome courses of action, or the ten ways of
righteous conduct, there are many alternative names for these qualities,
and there are also many passages where these ten qualities are listed
without a heading. The section in the Pali Canon that contains the
longest description of these qualities is at A. V. 249-308 (running to
fifty-nine pages).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn140">140</a></sup></p>
<p>It appears that in general contemporary Buddhist teachings there is more
emphasis on the negative aspects of the ten wholesome courses of action
(or ‘ways of righteous conduct’) – an emphasis on avoidance and
omission – than the positive aspects – on what should be performed or
practised – even though the Pali Canon describes both positive and
negative aspects. {561}</p>
<p>Apart from the five precepts and the ten ways of righteous conduct,
morality (<em>sīla</em>) is also presented according to the factors of the
Eightfold Path (= the first seven factors of <em>dhamma-cariyā</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn141">141</a></sup> or
according to the teaching on the four vices of conduct
(<em>kamma-kilesa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn142">142</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>(Trans.: note that this appendix is attached to chapter 11 of the
Thai edition of <em>Buddhadhamma</em>, on the Middle Path.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that at A. I. 269-70 the Buddha classifies the eighth and ninth
factors of the righteous ways of conduct (<em>dhamma-cariyā</em> = the ten
wholesome courses of action – <em>kusala-kammapatha</em>), i.e.
non-covetousness (<em>anabhijjhā</em>) &amp; non-ill-will (<em>abyāpāda</em>), as
<em>citta-sampadā</em> (’mental cultivation’; ‘mental accomplishment’), which
means that they are part of the ‘training in higher mentality’
(<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>): they are part of concentration (<em>samādhi</em>). (The
first seven factors of the righteous ways of conduct are classified as
<em>sīla-sampadā</em> – the accomplishment of virtue; the tenth factor is
classified as <em>diṭṭhi-sampadā</em> – accomplishment of view.) This is
because the eighth and ninth factors are devoid of the first two
hindrances (<em>nīvaraṇa</em>): covetousness (<em>abhijjhā</em>) and ill-will
(<em>byāpāda</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn143">143</a></sup> The abandonment of the five hindrances is the initial
step in reaching ‘attainment concentration’ (<em>appanā-samādhi</em>) and
accessing jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn144">144</a></sup> Non-covetousness and non-ill-will are states
devoid of the first two hindrances; the absence of the hindrances in
itself equals concentration (<em>samādhi</em>).</p>
<p>There are other passages, however, in which these two factors are
classified as wisdom factors. The reasons for classifying these two
factors either as factors of concentration or as factors of wisdom is
such: the state of mind possessing non-covetousness and non-ill-will, or
the development of these factors in the mind, is classified as training
in higher mentality – as concentration; thoughts or intentions
consisting of these two factors is classified as ‘right intention’
(<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>) – as training in higher wisdom. In the presentation
of the wholesome courses of action at M. I. 287-8, the emphasis is on
thoughts and intentions consisting of these two factors and therefore
they are classified under right intention.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn145">145</a></sup> When viewed as pure
mental factors, however, they are classified under mental cultivation as
explained above.</p>
<p>Note also in this context that if one covets the belonging of someone
else, but one is not yet intent on acquiring it for oneself, then one is
not corrupted; the same is true if one becomes angry but has not yet
begun to harbour evil thoughts and to wish for someone else to be
harmed.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn146">146</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-5-ill-effects-resulting-from-transgression-of-the-five-precepts" id="appendix-5-ill-effects-resulting-from-transgression-of-the-five-precepts">Appendix 5: Ill-Effects Resulting from Transgression of the Five Precepts</a></h2>
<p>The commentaries present principles for judging the severity of
ill-effects resulting from killing various sorts of creatures, based on
the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Degree of virtue: killing someone of great virtue has dire
consequences, while killing a creature endowed with meagre or no
spiritual virtues has less serious consequences; e.g.: killing an
arahant is more serious than killing an unenlightened person;
killing a domestic animal is more serious than killing a wild
animal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Size: in regard to animals, whose merits are more or less equal,
killing a large animal is more serious than killing a small animal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effort: making great effort to kill is more serious than making
little effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defilement or intention: if the defilements or intentions are strong
there are more serious ill-effects than if the defilements or
intentions are weak; e.g. killing with anger or out of premeditated
hatred is more serious than killing in self-defence.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The commentaries offer a similar analysis in regard to the other
precepts. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The consequences of stealing correspond to the value of the stolen
object, the virtue of the owner of the object, and the degree of
effort made in stealing the object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consequences of sexual misconduct depend on the virtue of the
violated person, the intensity of defilement, and the degree of
effort made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consequences of lying are determined by the interests and
advantages at stake. E.g.: the case of someone who is reluctant to
give up a possession and who claims he doesn’t have it is less
serious than that of someone who gives false testimony in court; the
situation of a renunciant speaking a falsehood as a joke is less
serious than him deliberately and falsely claiming to have achieved
a spiritual realization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ill-effects of consuming intoxicants depend on the defilements
or unwholesome mind states occurring at the time of drinking, on the
amount consumed, and on the effects of drinking that lead to evil
and unskilful behaviour.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn147">147</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-6-variant-meanings-of-vinaya" id="appendix-6-variant-meanings-of-vinaya">Appendix 6: Variant Meanings of ‘Vinaya’</a></h2>
<p>The commentaries refer to the <em>vinaya</em> in the sense of a code of
precepts or rules as a ‘prescribed code of discipline’
(<em>paññatti-vinaya</em>). There exist, however, several other important terms
in which the word <em>vinaya</em> is used. One of these, which is found
frequently and has a similar meaning to that just mentioned, is
<em>ariya-vinaya</em>, which refers to the code of conduct, way of life, or
system of training of noble beings. This term corresponds to the term
<em>sugata-vinaya</em>, which the Buddha defined as <em>brahmacariya</em>: the ‘holy
life’ or the way of leading a supreme life. {939} This is consistent
with the commentaries, which define <em>ariya-vinaya</em> as the Buddhist
religion;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn148">148</a></sup> this definition is broader than that of <em>vinaya</em> in the
context of virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn149">149</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-7-practice-for-the-welfare-of-the-manyfolk" id="appendix-7-practice-for-the-welfare-of-the-manyfolk">Appendix 7: Practice for the Welfare of the Manyfolk</a></h2>
<p>Apart from those passages cited in the main text above, there are many
more examples in the Pali Canon of the teaching on practising for the
wellbeing and happiness of all beings, for example: the sending forth of
the disciples to proclaim the teachings was for this purpose;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn150">150</a></sup> the
Well-Farer and the Well-Farer’s discipline (<em>sugata-vinaya</em>) exist for
this purpose;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn151">151</a></sup> the Buddha recommended studying, practising, and
rehearsing the Dhamma so that the holy life – the Buddhist religion –
will last for a long time, in order to benefit all beings;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn152">152</a></sup> the
Buddha emphasized sangha harmony and warned against sangha schism,
interpersonal quarrels, incorrect teachings on the Dhammavinaya, and
leaders in the sangha who possess wrong view, out of consideration for
the wellbeing of the multitudes.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn153">153</a></sup></p>
<p>The essential principle of practising for the wellbeing of the manyfolk
is to establish people in the ‘noble path’ (<em>ariyañāya-dhamma</em>), so that
they possess virtuous qualities (<em>kalyāṇa-dhamma</em>) and wholesome
qualities (<em>kusala-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn154">154</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-8-honouring-the-dhamma-honouring-the-vinaya" id="appendix-8-honouring-the-dhamma-honouring-the-vinaya">Appendix 8: Honouring the Dhamma, Honouring the Vinaya</a></h2>
<p>The Buddha honoured the Dhamma, and he said that whenever the sangha is
possessed of greatness then he also honours the sangha.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn155">155</a></sup> This
practice of veneration accords in principle with both the six and the
seven kinds of respect, which include respect for the Master (the
Buddha), respect for the Dhamma, respect for the Sangha, and respect for
the training (Vinaya).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn156">156</a></sup></p>
<p>There is one noteworthy point to make here about the term ‘belief’ in
reference to arahants. On one level the term ‘belief’ can be used in
relation to the Dhamma. The Buddhist teachings classify this belief as
one stage in the development of wisdom (corresponding to the term
‘faith’). In this context arahants have passed beyond this stage of
‘belief’, because they have penetrated and realized the truth for
themselves and do not need to believe anyone else.</p>
<p>On another level the term ‘belief’ can be used in relation to the Vinaya
or to a set of directives, which are connected to a social code of
discipline (corresponding to the term ‘obedience’). In this context
arahants are obedient or highly disciplined, as confirmed by a passage
in the scriptures stating that if the Buddha commanded an arahant (or
other awakened person) to walk into a bog, the arahant would obey
without hesitation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn157">157</a></sup> {940}</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-9-showing-respect-according-to-seniority" id="appendix-9-showing-respect-according-to-seniority">Appendix 9: Showing Respect According to Seniority</a></h2>
<p>The use of seniority (i.e. the number of years that a monk has been
ordained) as the standard for showing respect is the most appropriate,
convenient, and practical method of conduct, and it accords with the
Buddha’s aim for the sangha to be an example for others – of not using
ancestry, social standing, or caste as the criterion for respect.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn158">158</a></sup></p>
<p>An alternative criterion is to use the level of spiritual realization as
the standard, but this method would be confusing and ultimately
ineffective, because realization is not obvious and is difficult to
prove, and realized persons do not go around boasting about their
achievements. There were monks who proposed this standard but the Buddha
refused to adopt it.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn159">159</a></sup></p>
<p>What is particularly worthy of attention here is that while the Buddha
chose seniority as the criterion for showing respect in the context of
social relationships, which relates to external conditions, in the
context of training in order to reach the highest goal, which is an
internal factor and lies at the essence of the Buddhist teachings, he
considered spiritual virtue to be the ideal and the true criterion for
respect.</p>
<p>Those monks who receive honour according to the statutes of the Vinaya
or according to rules of social interaction should be aware of the truth
that it is the spiritual qualities that a person has realized, or
righteous conduct (for example to be ‘one who has practised well’ –
<em>supaṭipanno</em> – as mentioned in the nine attributes of the
Sangha),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn160">160</a></sup> that truly make a person worthy of respect, and that
these spiritual qualities must be cultivated within oneself.</p>
<p>The Buddha gave many reminders of this truth to the elders in the
sangha, for example in this Dhammapada verse:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Having grey hair does not make a person an elder.<br />
He may be ancient in years, but he gets old in vain.</p>
<p>One who possesses honesty, virtue,<br />
Harmlessness, restraint and control,<br />
Such a one who is a sage purged of impurities<br />
Is indeed called an elder.</p>
<p><em>Dh. verses 260-61.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>One passage in the Pali Canon divides elders into three kinds: elders by
‘birth’ (i.e. by seniority – <em>jāti-thera</em>), elders by truth
(<em>dhamma-thera</em>), and elders by convention (elders simply by name –
<em>sammati-thera</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn161">161</a></sup> Elders designated according to the Vinaya may be
classified as elders by convention. Another passage mentions four
qualities that make a person an elder.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn162">162</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-10-is-buddhism-a-pessimistic-religion" id="appendix-10-is-buddhism-a-pessimistic-religion">Appendix 10: Is Buddhism a Pessimistic Religion?</a></h2>
<p>The passage by Ven. Sāriputta quoted under the section ‘Theistic
Morality vs a Doctrine of Natural Truth’ is cited in Albert Schweitzer’s
‘Indian Thought and Its Development’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn163">163</a></sup> It is re-cited in Joseph L.
Sutton’s ‘Problems of Politics and Administration in Thailand’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn164">164</a></sup></p>
<p>In this latter book (pp. 2-8), Prof. Sutton refers to other Dhamma
teachings, for example the teachings on kamma, rebirth, and the retreat
or escape from the world, to corroborate his critical viewpoint. I have
touched upon the Buddhist teachings on intentional action (karma/kamma)
already in earlier chapters. As for the claim that the teaching on
rebirth leads to procrastination (as opposed to Christian doctrine which
emphasizes a single lifetime), this can be answered by the Buddhist
teaching on the extreme difficulty of being reborn as a human being –
the chances for human rebirth are less than that of a blind turtle
sticking its head through a hole in a piece of wood adrift in the ocean.
Furthermore, Buddhism teaches that redemption is not possible through
baptism or through confession of one’s sins.</p>
<p>As for the issue of withdrawing from worldly matters, Prof. Sutton
refers to the following quote: ‘Those who love nothing in this world are
rich in joy and free from pain.’ This quotation is found in the Udāna:
<em>Tasmā hi te sukhino vītasokā yesaṃ piyaṃ natthi kuhiñci loke</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn165">165</a></sup>
The Pali word for love here is <em>piya</em>, which refers to a form of
infatuation leading to personal attachment. This passage describes the
attributes of an awakened being; it emphasizes liberation and the
happiness of liberation, free from selfish infatuation and endowed with
unbounded love – <em>mettā</em>. When one’s mind is free from suffering and
selfish attachment, there is a complete spaciousness to act and abide
with lovingkindness and compassion. One acts purely for the wellbeing of
other beings, as is epitomized by the maxim: <em>bahujana-sukhāya
lokānukampāya</em>: ‘For the happiness of the manyfolk, for the
compassionate assistance of the world.’</p>
<p>However limited Prof. Sutton’s understanding was, or whatever his
intentions, his comments can be useful as a reminder for Buddhists to
deepen their knowledge and to clarify their understanding of the
Buddhist teachings. There are many Western scholars who share Prof.
Sutton’s criticisms, and it must be conceded that prevalent beliefs and
misunderstandings among Thai Buddhists contribute to such criticism.
(When <em>Buddhadhamma</em> was first published thirty years ago, Westerners
had a limited understanding of Buddhism and harboured various
misconceptions, for example that Buddhism teaches to see the world in a
negative light, filled only with suffering. These days, this situation
has changed dramatically.)</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-11-moral-precepts-sīla-and-religious-practices-vata" id="appendix-11-moral-precepts-sīla-and-religious-practices-vata">Appendix 11: Moral Precepts (sīla) and Religious Practices (vata)</a></h2>
<p>Moral precepts (<em>sīla</em>) and religious practices (<em>vata</em>) differ.
According to the Mahāniddesa, <em>sīla</em> refers to self-restraint,
self-control, and the non-transgression of precepts, while <em>vata</em> refers
to undertaking religious practices or vows. The rules in the bhikkhu
Vinaya contain both moral precepts and religious practices. The ascetic
practices (<em>dhutaṅga</em>) are <em>vata</em>, not moral precepts – <em>sīla</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn166">166</a></sup>
Rules of practice that are <em>vata</em> but not <em>sīla</em>, like the ascetic
practices, are extra: they are means to practise strictly in order to
enhance self-discipline and self-development, and they emphasize
contentment with little. But they are not mandatory: they are undertaken
suiting one’s disposition and level of preparedness. This differs from
moral precepts, which each member of a community must keep; if someone
fails to keep them there are harmful consequences both to the individual
and collectively (and if the moral precept is included in the Vinaya,
there are designated forms of punishment).</p>
<p>Furthermore, moral precepts are generally fundamental principles of
behaviour, whereas religious practices are supplementary, increasing a
sense of virtue and discipline and supporting the precepts, especially
by removing or decreasing the opportunity to transgress them. In any
case, some religious practices (<em>vata</em>), although they may appear
austere and strict, are incompatible with Buddhist principles; the
Buddha forbade them and in some cases they are incorrect according to
the Vinaya. Examples include the vow of silence (<em>mūga-vata</em>;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn167">167</a></sup> this
vow prevents wrong speech, for example lying; the Buddha criticized this
practice and called it ‘behaving like cattle’) and the vow to eat only
fruit that falls naturally from a tree (this vow prevents a person from
harming animals and plants; it is considered an overly austere practice
kept by members of non-Buddhist sects who hide from society).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn168">168</a></sup></p>
<p>Note that there are also secondary or minor observances, called <em>vatta</em>,
that complement moral precepts (<em>sīla</em>). In some Pali editions of the
Tipiṭaka in Thai script, there is some mix up and confusion between the
terms <em>vata</em> (religious practice/austere practice) and <em>vatta</em>
(religious observance).</p>

<p>The five precepts have been upheld and practised since ancient
times. They were acknowledged by and incorporated into Buddhism from
the beginning. Generally speaking, there is not a large body of
training rules for householders, and therefore the term ‘lay
<em>vinaya</em>’ is not used (the five precepts are considered the code of
discipline for the laity). Having said this, the commentaries
occasionally classify specific principles or factors as a <em>vinaya</em>
for householders, e.g.: the Sumaṅgalavilāsinī states that the
Siṅgālaka Sutta is a ‘discipline for laity’ (<em>gihi-vinaya</em>) – [DA.
3/151]; and the Paramatthajotikā states that abstaining from the
ten unwholesome ways of action (<em>akusala-kammapatha</em>) is a
‘discipline for householders’ (<em>āgāriya-vinaya</em>) – [KhA. 117].</p>

original system of sangha administration relies on a basic system of
training (the training and discipline that begins at ordination).
During times when this basic system of training is faulty or lost,
the authentic system of sangha administration cannot function and is
replaced by some other system of governance. This is because the
true system of sangha administration depends on all monks having
received a genuine and effective training. Moreover, at times when
the system of sangha administration has gone into decline and there
are efforts to restore it, occasionally people merely make a
perfunctory appeal for restoration without considering the true

<p><em>Forerunners of the Middle Way<br />
Initial Stage of Practice 1:<br />
Skilful Words of Others &amp; Virtuous Friendship</em></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned in the previous chapter, right view is a crucial component
of the Path. It is the beginning point of practice and the first stage
of Buddhist spiritual training. Right view needs to be gradually
developed, purified, and freed from bias, until it is transformed into
direct realization. The establishment of right view is thus of vital
importance.</p>
<p>In the Tipiṭaka the cultivation of right view is described as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are two factors conducive to the arising of right view:
the teachings of others (paratoghosa) and wise reflection
(yoniso-manasikāra).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. I. 87.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Two factors conducive to the arising of right view:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Paratoghosa</em>: the ‘proclamations’ of others; external influence or
inducement, e.g.: other people’s teachings, advice, explanations,
and transmissions; advertisements, information, news, written
material, and schooling. Here, it refers specifically to wholesome
teachings, in particular to the transmission of Dhamma teachings,
and to the knowledge and counsel received from virtuous friends
(<em>kalyāṇa-mitta</em>). This is an external, social factor. It can be
described as the way of faith (<em>saddhā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yoniso-manasikāra</em>: wise reflection; analytical reflection;
reasoned or systematic attention. To know how to reflect on things
in an objective way, to apply reasoned thought, to inquire into the
origin of things, to trace the entire trajectory of phenomena, and
to analyze an object or problem in order to see it according to
truth and according to its interrelated causes and conditions,
without allowing personal craving or attachment to interfere. This
is an internal, spiritual factor. It can be described as the way of
wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). {564}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following passage emphasizes the importance of these two factors in
spiritual training:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>For a monk who is still in training ... I do not see any other
external factor that is so helpful as good friendship.</p>
<p>For a monk who is still in training ... I do not see any other
internal factor that is so helpful as wise reflection.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>
<p><em>It. 9-10.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These two factors are mutually supportive. Ordinary people, whose wisdom
is not yet proficient, rely on the teachings and guidance of others, and
if these teachings are presented skilfully they can often progress
quickly. Nonetheless, they must also train in an ability to think
correctly for themselves if they are to reach the final goal.</p>
<p>Those people who are proficient in wisdom are able to use wise
reflection, but they may need to rely on the teachings of others for
guidance at the beginning stages of practice and as a support to
accelerate their spiritual training.</p>
<p>The establishment of right view by way of the first factor
(<em>paratoghosa</em>; the teachings of others) begins with and relies
primarily on faith. When one applies this factor to a system of training
one must determine how to best receive advice and encouragement, that
is, one requires a teacher who has superior attributes and abilities,
and who uses effective means of teaching.</p>
<p>For this reason the definition of <em>paratoghosa</em> in training highlights
the principle of virtuous friendship (<em>kalyāṇa-mittatā</em>).</p>
<p>The second factor – <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em> – is a principle of wisdom,
and so in training one needs to determine how best to support such wise
reflection.</p>
<p>When combining these two factors, virtuous friendship is considered an
external factor and wise reflection an internal factor.</p>
<p>Finally, if one associates with bad friends and thus receives false
teachings, and one applies unwise, incorrect reflection
(<em>ayoniso-manasikāra</em>), the result is the opposite: one develops wrong
view (<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>). {565}</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#way-of-faith-and-confidence" id="way-of-faith-and-confidence">Way of Faith and Confidence</a></h2>
<p>The proclamations of others (<em>paratoghosa</em>) giving rise to right view
are those teachings which are virtuous and correct, reasonable and
useful, and which explain the truth, especially those teachings stemming
from a sense of love and well-wishing.</p>
<p>Virtuous teachings spring from a virtuous source: from a good, virtuous,
and wise person, who is referred to as a ‘righteous man’ (<em>sappurisa</em>)
or a ‘learned person’ (<em>paṇḍita</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-righteous">Righteous and Learned</a>) If such a righteous or learned person
performs the duty of teachings others and engendering right view, he or
she is referred to as a beautiful or virtuous friend (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>).</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Righteous and Learned</span><a id="note-righteous"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the term <em>sappurisa</em> is paired with the term <em>ariya</em>, the
commentators offer various definitions: <em>ariya</em> refers to the Buddha,
while <em>sappurisa</em> refers to Silent Buddhas and disciples of the
Tathāgata, or to all disciples; alternatively, these two terms have
the same meaning (e.g.: MA. I. 21, 24; SA. II. 252, 254; NdA. 76, 79;
DhsA. 349, 353).</p>
<p>When <em>sappurisa</em> occurs on its own, it refers to the Buddha and all
the aforementioned individuals (e.g.: DA. III. 1020, 1058; AA. III.
63).</p>
<p>The term <em>paṇḍita</em> can be used in reference to the Buddha and all the
aforementioned individuals (e.g.: KhA. 128; SnA. I. 300).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the terms <em>ariya</em>, <em>sappurisa</em>, and <em>paṇḍita</em> have
overlapping meanings and are occasionally used interchangeably. But if
one is to speak strictly according to the Buddha’s words, the term
<em>paṇḍita</em> refers to someone who has reached the two ‘benefits’
(<em>attha</em>) described in earlier chapters (there are also some
additional technical definitions for <em>paṇḍita</em>), and the term
<em>sappurisa</em> refers to a person with the specific attributes described
below.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>If one is in search of right view one does not need to wait until a
righteous or virtuous person seeks one out. On the contrary, one should
strive to find such a person – to consult with, listen to, request
teachings from, associate with, and study with the wise. This is called
association with the righteous or virtuous.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Regardless of who initiates the contact, once there is mutual influence
and acknowledgement the person is said to have a virtuous friend and to
participate in a virtuous friendship (<em>kalyāṇamittatā</em>).</p>
<p>The definition of a virtuous friend is not restricted to the common
meaning of a good friend, but it refers to a person who is well-equipped
to teach, advise, explain, encourage, and guide, and to act as a role
model in the correct path of spiritual training. The Visuddhimagga
offers examples, including the Buddha, the arahant disciples, teachers,
mentors, and wise, learned individuals, who are capable of teaching and
providing consultation, even those people who are younger than
oneself.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In the formal development of wisdom, the presence of a virtuous friend
is classified as part of the stage of faith (<em>saddhā</em>). In the wider
system of spiritual training, good companionship encompasses a whole
range of factors, including: the presence of teachers, mentors, and
parents; the attributes and skills of one’s teachers; the principles,
methods, techniques, and means of teaching; books and other forms of
media; role models, for example a ‘great being’ (<em>mahāpurisa</em>) or
someone who is accomplished in the Dhamma; and those wholesome and
beneficial social and environmental factors conducive to wisdom
development. {566}</p>

<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, just as the dawn’s light is the precursor to the rising of the
sun, so too, for a monk good friendship is the forerunner and
precursor for the arising of the Noble Eightfold Path. When a monk has
a good friend, it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate
this Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 29-30.</em></p>
<p>This is the entire holy life, Ānanda, that is, good friendship, good
companionship ... for when a monk has a good friend ... it is to be
expected that he will develop and cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
<p>By relying on me as a good friend, beings subject to birth are freed
from birth; beings subject to aging are freed from aging; beings
subject to death are freed from death; beings subject to sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair are freed from sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 2-4.</em></p>
<p>Monks, just as the dawn’s silver and golden light is the precursor to
the rising of the sun, so too, for a monk good friendship is the
forerunner and precursor for the arising of the seven factors of
enlightenment. When a monk has a good friend, it is to be expected
that he will develop and cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 78.</em></p>
<p>No other thing do I see, O monks, which is so responsible for causing
unarisen wholesome states to arise and arisen unwholesome states to
wane as good companionship. In one who has good friends, wholesome
states not yet arisen will arise and unwholesome states that have

<p>which is so conducive to the stability, the non-decline, the
non-disappearance of the true Dhamma as good companionship.</p>

<p>As to external factors, I do not see any other factor that is so
conducive to great blessings as good companionship.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 17; cf.: S. V. 102.</em></p>
<p>For a monk who is in training, who has not yet reached the fruit of
arahantship and who aspires toward the unsurpassed security from
bondage, I do not see any other external factor that is so beneficial
as good companionship. When a monk has a good friend, he will
eliminate the unwholesome and cultivate the wholesome.</p>
<p><em>It. 10.</em></p>
<p>When a monk has a good friend ... it can be expected that:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He will be virtuous, restrained and careful in respect to the
Pāṭimokkha, perfect in conduct and resort....</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He will [have the opportunity to listen and to engage in talk]
according to his wishes on various subjects that refine his
character and purify the mind, that is to say, talk on fewness of
wishes ... on the application of energy, on virtue, concentration,
wisdom, liberation, and on the knowledge and vision of liberation.
{567}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He will be persistent and energetic in abandoning the unwholesome
and in perfecting the wholesome. He will be diligent, steadfast
and strong, not neglecting the duty in regard to wholesome
qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He will be equipped with wisdom, possessed of noble wisdom, which
discerns the rise and fall of phenomena, gains penetrative insight
into defilements, and leads to the complete end of suffering.</p>

<p>From these quotes one is able to see that the teachings on association
with others given by the Buddha to monks aim primarily at the highest
goal or ultimate reality (<em>paramattha</em>), and clearly focus on
establishing transcendent right view. The teachings given to general
people or to laypeople, on the other hand, emphasize basic, everyday
benefits (<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>) combined with profound, spiritual
benefits (<em>samparāyikattha</em>). These latter teachings focus on mutual
help and assistance, and on generating mundane right view, that is, a
belief in the law of kamma – to recognize one’s responsibility in
regard to good and bad actions. For the most part, they do not emphasize
transcendent right view, of seeing phenomena as they truly exist. These
higher, transcendent principles are implicit in the mundane teachings,
however, and the Buddha would introduce them as befitting the
circumstances. People are at different levels of spiritual maturity; the
Buddha would prepare people by gradually laying a foundation for
them.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#attributes-of-a-virtuous-friend" id="attributes-of-a-virtuous-friend">Attributes of a Virtuous Friend</a></h2>
<p>The specific attributes of a virtuous friend, distinguishing such a
person as a ‘righteous person’ (<em>sappurisa</em>) or a ‘wise person’
(<em>paṇḍita</em>), are as follows:</p>
<p>There are seven distinguishing qualities (<em>sappurisa-dhamma</em>) of a
virtuous person:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dhammaññutā</em>: one knows essential principles and causes; one knows
the laws of nature; one knows essential teachings, guidelines, and
responsibilities, which are the cause for successful and effective
action in accord with one’s goals, for example: a monk is familiar
with those teachings that he must study and practise, and a ruler
knows the righteous principles of leadership and governance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Atthaññutā</em>: one knows objectives and effects; one knows the
meaning and purpose of specific teachings, codes of practice, and
duties; one knows the desired fruit of specific actions, for
example: a monk knows the meaning and purpose of those things he
studies and practises, and he recognizes the good which is the goal
and essential meaning of life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attaññutā</em>: one knows oneself; one knows one’s own attributes,
disposition, station, strength, knowledge, skills, abilities, and
virtues as they really are; this knowledge is conducive to
appropriate and effective behaviour. For example, a monk knows his
own level of faith, moral conduct, learning, generosity, wisdom, and
insight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mattaññutā</em>: one knows moderation; one knows what is adequate and
sufficient, for example: one knows moderation in regard to eating
and to spending one’s wealth; a monk knows moderation in regard to
receiving the four requisites. {570}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kālaññutā</em>: one knows time; one knows which times are suitable to
perform specific activities; for instance, one knows when to study,
when to work, and when to rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Parisaññutā</em>: one knows society; one knows the locality, the
meeting places, the community; one knows the manners, moral codes,
customs, and other suitable practices in regard to specific
communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Puggalaññutā</em>: one knows persons; one knows the differences between
people in regard to their dispositions, abilities, and virtues; this
knowledge helps determine how one relates appropriately to each
individual. For example, one knows whether one should associate with
someone or not; one knows how to deal with, employ, praise,
criticize, and teach others in an effective way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A <em>paṇḍita</em> is a wise person, someone who conducts his or her life with
wisdom. There are many ways in which the Buddha described such a
person’s attributes, for example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, by his deeds a fool is marked, by his deeds a wise man is
marked. Both are revealed clearly by way of their actions.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup> By

mind. By three things the wise person can be known: by good conduct of
body, speech and mind.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 102.</em></p>
<p>Monks, there are these three characteristics of a fool, signs of a
fool, ways of behaving of a fool. What three? Here a fool is one who
thinks bad thoughts, speaks bad words, and does bad deeds.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 102-103; M. III. 163.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, by three things a wise person can be known: he poses an issue
with due consideration, he solves an issue with due consideration, and
whenever another person solves an issue with due consideration, with
gentle and well-spoken words, reasonable and to the point, he
expresses delight.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 103-104.</em></p>
<p>Monks, there are two kinds of fools: he who shoulders a burden that
does not befall him, and he who shirks a burden that befalls him.</p>
<p>Monks, there are two kinds of wise persons: he who shoulders a burden
that befalls him, and he who takes not up one that does not befall
him.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 84.</em></p>
<p>A foolish monk desires undue praise, distinction from other monks,
authority in the monasteries, and honour among families.</p>
<p>‘Let both laymen and monks think that only by myself was this deed
accomplished; in every work, great or small, let them be subject to
me.’ Such is the ambition of the fool; his envy and pride only
accumulate.</p>
<p><em>Dh. verses 73 &amp; 74.</em></p>
<p>The good are unattached to all conditions; the righteous do not speak
with a desire for sense pleasures; whether affected by pleasure or
pain, the wise show neither elation nor dejection. {571}</p>
<p>Neither for the sake of himself nor for the sake of another does a
sage do any wrong; he desires not son, wealth, kingdom, or personal
success by unjust means; he is virtuous, wise, and upright.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Dh. verses 83 &amp; 84.</em></p>

</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Whether he is shown honour or not, his concentration is unshakeable;
he abides vigilant and alert. Such a person meditates consistently and

man.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup></p>

an elder.</p>

<p><em>J. V. 146.</em></p>
<p>Monks, there are these four occasions. What four?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The occasion when an action is both unpleasant and after it is
accomplished it is unprofitable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The occasion when an action is unpleasant but after it is
accomplished it is beneficial.</p>

<li>
<p>The occasion when an action is both pleasant and after it is
accomplished it is beneficial.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these occasions, in a case when an action is both unpleasant and
unprofitable, one deems action inadvisable for two reasons, for it is
both unpleasant and unprofitable.</p>
<p>In a case when an action is unpleasant but beneficial, one may know
who is a fool and who is wise in the matter of personal strength,
effort and perseverance. For the fool has no such consideration as
this: ‘Though this is an occasion when action is unpleasant, yet when
it is accomplished it is beneficial.’ Accordingly he does not act, and
his inaction brings him loss. But the wise man considers: ‘Though this
is an occasion when action is unpleasant, yet when it is accomplished
it is beneficial.’ Accordingly he acts and the result is to his
profit.</p>
<p>In a case when an action is pleasant but unprofitable, one may know
who is a fool and who is wise in the matter of personal strength,
effort and perseverance. For the fool does not consider thus: ‘Though
this act is pleasant, yet it brings loss.’ Accordingly he acts and the
result is loss. Whereas the wise man reflects: ‘Though this act is
pleasant, yet its results bring loss.’ He therefore acts not and the
result is to his profit.</p>
<p>In a case when an action is both pleasant and beneficial, one deems
action advisable for two reasons, for it is both pleasant and
beneficial.</p>

<p>In the case that someone associates with such a wise or virtuous person,
or else this person initiates the sharing of knowledge and goodness with
others, he or she is referred to as a ‘virtuous friend’
(<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>). A virtuous friend engenders right understanding and
wholesome faith in others, by teaching, advising, and imparting
knowledge. He or she acts with kindness and compassion, helping to
cultivate right view and correct practice in others.</p>
<p>Besides the distinctive attributes of a wise person outlined in the
quotations above, it is possible to describe a virtuous friend –
someone who should be sought out and associated with – by considering
the qualities mentioned in the definition of virtuous friendship
(<em>kalyāṇamittatā</em>).</p>
<p>Virtuous friendship is defined as ‘consorting, associating, and
affiliating with, and a devotion and dedication to, someone who has
faith (<em>saddhā</em>), morality (<em>sīla</em>), (great) learning (<em>suta</em>),
generosity (<em>cāga</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup></p>
<p>In some passages only four of these qualities are mentioned, excluding
learning, which is considered to be less important than the other four
factors. Other passages suggest that when one lives in a specific
locality one should associate closely, converse, and consult with those
people who are endowed with faith, virtue, generosity, and wisdom; one
should take these people as role models and emulate their spiritual
qualities.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>A virtuous friend should also possess the seven basic virtues referred
to as the ‘qualities of a virtuous friend’ (<em>kalyāṇamitta-dhamma</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Piyo</em>: ‘endearing’; the ability to ‘access another’s heart’, create
a sense of intimacy and confidentiality, and make it easy for
students to ask questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Garu</em>: ‘venerable’; acting appropriately in regard to one’s status
as a teacher; creating a feeling of ease, reliability, and safety.
{574}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhāvanīyo</em>: ‘inspiring’; being highly intelligent, having true
knowledge, and constantly training and improving oneself;
praiseworthy and exemplary; being spoken about and thought of by
one’s disciples with inspiration, confidence, and delight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vattā</em>: ‘effective at speaking’; being a skilful speaker and good
counsellor, able to explain things so that others understand, and
aware of what and how to speak in specific circumstances; giving
skilful advice and admonishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vacanakkhamo</em>: ‘a patient listener’; ready to listen to the
questions and suggestions of others, even those that are trifling;
able to endure insults and criticisms, without getting fed up or
losing one’s temper. (See
Note <a href="#note-enduring-criticism">Enduring Criticism</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Gambhīrañca kathaṃ kattā</em>: ‘able to expound on profound subjects’;
able to teach and explain complex and profound matters so that
others understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>No caṭṭhāne niyojaye</em>: ‘not spurring on to a useless end’; not
encouraging one to follow harmful or inappropriate ways.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Enduring Criticism</span><a id="note-enduring-criticism"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Pali Canon this term <em>vacanakkhamo</em> refers to someone who can
endure the blame and criticism of others and is prepared to modify and
improve himself.</p>
<p>Ven. Sāriputta is praised as the paragon of those people endowed with
this virtue (e.g.: S. I. 64).</p>
<p>The commentaries explain how some people are able to admonish others,
but as soon as they themselves receive admonishment they become angry;
Sāriputta, however, was able to both admonish others and to humbly
receive admonishment.</p>
<p>There is a story of a seven-year old novice pointing out to Sāriputta
that the border of his inner robe was hanging low; Sāriputta listened
politely and went to set his robe in order (SA. I. 123).</p>

<p>Although the following passages by the Buddha do not explicitly claim to
describe the attributes of a virtuous friend, the virtues mentioned can
be considered as companion qualities of a virtuous friend:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, a monk endowed with six qualities is capable of acting for the
benefit and welfare of himself and others. What six? Here, a monk:</p>

<p>There are, O monks, three types of persons found in the world. What
three? There is one who should not be associated with, consorted with,

consorted with, and approached.</p>
<p>Of what nature is the person who should not be associated with,

<p>Of what nature is the person who should be associated with, consorted
with, and approached? In this case a certain person is like oneself in
respect to morality, concentration and wisdom. Such a person should be
associated with, consorted with, and approached. Why is that? With
this idea: ‘As we are equal in morality, concentration and wisdom, our
discussions will be on morality, concentration and wisdom; our
discussions will proceed in unison and will lead to our happiness.’
For this reason one should associate with, consort with, and approach
such a person.</p>
<p>Of what nature is the person who should be honoured and revered,
associated with, consorted with, and approached? In this case a
certain person is superior in the way of morality, concentration and
wisdom. Such a person should be honoured and revered, associated with,
consorted with, and approached. Why is that? With this idea: ‘In this
way I shall complete the body of virtuous conduct ... the body of
concentration ... the body of wisdom that is as yet incomplete, or by
way of wisdom in this respect I shall sustain the body of virtuous
conduct ... the body of concentration ... the body of wisdom that is
complete.’ For this reason one should honour and revere, associate
with, consort with, and approach such a person.</p>

</div>
<p>Although the Buddha repeatedly warned against associating with bad,
immoral people, note that in the passage above he presents an exception,
when one associates with such a person out of kindness and compassion
and with a desire to help. In any case, those who wish to help such a
person should first consider their own readiness beforehand.</p>
<p>Some of the teachings on the attributes of a virtuous friend emphasize
everyday, immediate benefits (sometimes also connected to higher,
spiritual benefits), for example the teaching on true and false friends
in the Siṅgālaka Sutta:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>See here, householder’s son, there are these four types who can be
seen as foes, as false friends: the swindler is one, the great talker
is one, the flatterer is one, and the troublemaker is one.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The man who is a swindler can be seen to be a false friend for
four reasons: he takes everything for himself, he wants a lot for
very little, he helps his friends only when he is in danger, and
he seeks his own ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The great talker can be seen to be a false friend for four
reasons: he talks of things that have passed away, he talks of
things that have not yet come to be, he offers assistance with
useless things, and when his friends are in need he makes up
excuses owing to some obstacle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flatterer can be seen to be a false friend for four reasons:
he assents to bad actions, he [equally] assents to good actions,
he praises you to your face, and he disparages you behind your
back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The troublemaker can be seen to be a false friend for four
reasons: he is a companion when you indulge in alcohol, when you
roam the streets at unfitting times, when you frequent places of
revelry and entertainment, and when you indulge in gambling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>See here, householder’s son, there are these four types who can be
seen to be true friends, good-hearted friends: a supportive friend is
one, the friend in happy and unhappy times is one, the friend who
points out what is good is one, and the friend who is considerate is
one. {576}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The supportive friend can be seen to be a true friend in four
ways: he looks after you when you are heedless, he looks after
your possessions when you are heedless, he is a refuge when you
are in danger, and when some business is to be done he lets you
have more than you ask for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The friend in happy and unhappy times can be seen to be a true
friend in four ways: he tells you his secrets, he guards your
secrets, he does not let you down in times of misfortune, he would
even sacrifice his life for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The friend who points out what is good can be seen to be a true
friend in four ways: he keeps you from wrongdoing, he supports you
in doing good, he informs you of things you did not previously
know, and he points out the path to heaven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The considerate friend can be seen to be a true friend in four
ways: he does not rejoice at your misfortune, he rejoices at your
good fortune, he stops others who speak against you, and he
commends others who speak in praise of you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>D. III. 185-8 (excerpt)</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A similar passage is found in the Aṅguttara Nikāya:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, a friend who possesses seven factors should be followed. What
seven? He gives what is difficult to give; he does what is difficult
to do; he patiently endures what is difficult to endure; he reveals
his own secrets; he keeps his friends’ secrets; he does not abandon
one in misfortune; he does not despise his friends when they are
destitute.</p>
<p><em>A. IV. 31.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The general principles of friendship are outlined in the teaching on the
six directions:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup></p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>See here, householder’s son, there are five ways in which a man should
minister to his friends and companions as the northern [lefthand]
direction:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>By gifts and generosity (<em>dāna</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By kindly, loving words (<em>piyavācā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By assistance and support (<em>atthacariyā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By offering constant friendship; by being a friend in good times
and bad (<em>samānattatā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By speaking honestly and sincerely (<em>avisaṁvādanatā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Note that the first four of these factors comprise the teaching referred
to as the four ‘bases of social solidarity’ (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>). This
teaching presents a principle of mutual assistance and of uniting people
in harmony. These factors are a way of expressing goodwill between
people. These two teachings, on the six directions and on the bases of
solidarity, are virtually identical and they show how Buddhism
encourages people to befriend one another or to respond to others as
friends.</p>
<p>Of these four factors, the offering of constant friendship – the
ability to adapt to others, to not be conceited, and to be a friend in
good times and bad – is essential and goes to the heart of friendship.
As described earlier, the Buddha distinguishes the friend in happy and
unhappy times as one of the four ‘true’ friends.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup> {577}</p>
<p>The bhikkhus, or renunciants in general,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup> should act as virtuous
friends for the laypeople. The responsibilities for a bhikkhu in
relation to a householder, according to honouring the zenith in the
teaching on the six directions, are identical to the attributes of a
true friend. The attribute of a true friend: ‘one who points out what is
good’ can be rephrased in this context as ‘bhikkhus are true friends as
they point out what is good.’ The duties of the monastic sangha towards
the laity, however, contain an additional two factors, amounting to six
factors in total:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To discourage them from doing evil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To encourage them to do good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To assist them with benevolence.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To inform them of things they have not previously known or heard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To explain and clarify those things they have heard.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn30">30</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To point out the way to heaven (to teach a way of life leading to
happiness).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The responsibilities of the monastic sangha in relation to the laity are
set down as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks – brahmans and householders are very helpful to you, as they
support you with the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings and
medicine for the sick. And you, too, should be very helpful to
brahmans and householders, by teaching them the Dhamma beautiful in
the beginning, beautiful in the middle, and beautiful in the end; by
expounding the holy life both in spirit and in letter, utterly
complete and pure. In this way, monks, in mutual dependence the
laypeople and those gone forth live the holy life for the purpose of
escaping the flood, for making a complete end to suffering.</p>
<p>In mutual dependence householders and the homeless both practise to
achieve the true Dhamma: the unsurpassed security from bondage.</p>
<p><em>It. 111-12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The following passage affirms the Buddha’s emphasis on assisting the
laity (by using righteous means):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, headman, the Tathāgata in many ways praises support for families,
the protection of families, compassion for families.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 324.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Having said this, while performing the duty of a virtuous friend in a
compassionate and honest manner for the laity, the monastic sangha must
be careful to preserve the unique attributes of an independent lifestyle
and the life of a renunciant. It is important to avoid fraternizing too
much with the laypeople, which can cause harm for both parties. It can
hinder individual spiritual progress and deprive the laypeople of a
refuge. If the monks are overly engaged in the world, the laity will
only have people who are as muddled and harried as they are to rely on;
they will not have an anchor to help release them from confusion and
turmoil.</p>
<p>This inappropriate relationship in which the monks become as caught up
in worldly affairs as the laity, and in which they are unable to help
lead the laypeople to inner freedom, is referred to as ‘getting ensnared
by (other) human beings’: {578}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And what, monks, is getting ensnared by human beings? Here, a monk
lives overly associating with laypeople; he rejoices with them and
grieves with them, he is happy when they are happy and sad when they
are sad, and he involves himself in their affairs and duties (he acts
as a busybody). This is called getting caught by human beings.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. IV. 180-81.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When engaged in the direct instruction of others, a virtuous friend
should follow the teachings emphasizing purity, kindness, and sincerity:</p>
<p>First, there is the group of five factors known as the ‘qualities of a
teacher’ (<em>dhammadesaka-dhamma</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To teach gradually and sequentially (<em>anupubbikathā</em>): to teach a
subject matter in stages, beginning with easy aspects and ending
with more profound aspects; to teach in a progressive, integrated,
and reasoned way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To explain causality (<em>pariyāya-dassāvī</em>): to clarify each aspect
and point of a specific subject matter; to be versatile in one’s
teaching, pointing out causal relationships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To teach with kindness and well-wishing (<em>anudayatā</em>): to teach with
a heart of lovingkindness, aiming for the welfare of one’s students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To refrain from seeking material rewards (<em>anāmisantara</em>): to teach
others without aiming for material gain, financial rewards, or
personal advantages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To not hurt oneself or others (<em>anupahacca</em>): to make the mind
impartial; to teach according to the gist and formal principles of a
specific subject matter; to focus on the theoretical and practical
meaning of a matter; to not exalt oneself while showing contempt for
others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The following passage describes both pure and impure teachings:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, a monk teaches the Dhamma to others with the thought: ‘Oh, may
they listen to the Dhamma from me! Having listened, may they gain
faith in me! Having gained faith, may they show their devotion to me!’
Such a monk’s teaching of the Dhamma is impure.</p>
<p>Monks, a monk teaches the Dhamma to others with the thought: ‘The
Dhamma that is well expounded by the Blessed One is to be realized
directly by oneself, timeless, inviting one to come and see, to be
brought within and realized, to be experienced individually by the
wise. Oh, may they listen to the Dhamma from me! Having listened, may
they clearly understand the Dhamma! Having clearly understood, may
they practise accordingly!’ Thus he teaches the Dhamma to others
because of the intrinsic excellence of the Dhamma; he teaches the
Dhamma to others out of compassion and sympathy, out of tender
concern. Such a bhikkhu’s teaching of the Dhamma is pure. {579}</p>
<p><em>S. II. 199.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In a similar way, the teaching on the six directions in reference to the
duties of teachers towards their students contains similar attributes.
Here, the emphasis is not so much on purity, but rather on kindness and
sincere commitment:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To counsel and train students in virtue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide students with a clear understanding of relevant subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide students with a complete education in various branches of
the arts and sciences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To recommend and praise the students’ virtues and abilities to
friends and colleagues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide students with security in all directions (to instruct
them on how to truly apply their knowledge and make a living).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, there are two qualities of a virtuous friend which should be
given special emphasis and which distinguish the excellence of such a
person: first, one is truly able to do that which one teaches, or one
has arrived at a specific realization about which one is able to teach
others; second, one is free; one is not stuck in confusion or tied up
with the same attachments as those people one guides. In reference to
the first quality, there are many teachings by the Buddha, for example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Let one first establish oneself<br />
In what is proper and good;<br />
Then instruct others.<br />
A learned person should be taintless.<br />
You should act as you teach. <em>Dh. verses 158-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Generally, these teachings on distinction focus on conduct or ethics,
but if a person has attained a specific realization by way of the mind
or by wisdom, and then acts as a virtuous friend, this is the best. If
it is not possible to find such a person, then one should seek someone
who has progressed farther on the spiritual path, or is at least equal
in this respect.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a very learned person, who possesses knowledge through
reading texts or other forms of study, can facilitate Dhamma realization
in someone else despite he himself having not yet attained such a
realization.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn34">34</a></sup> Similarly, it can happen that two people at equal
stages of spiritual maturity discuss and review the Dhamma together and
as a consequence they simultaneously arrive at a realization of
truth.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the great benefits of having a virtuous friend is that he or she
acts as a role model. As a result one is confident that those things one
practises and aspires to are truly feasible and achievable, and by
accomplishing these things one receives true and worthy results.
Moreover, a virtuous friend has greater knowledge, understanding, and
experience, and is thus able to recommend methods which facilitate or
speed up one’s practice.</p>
<p>A virtuous friend who has achieved the fruits of spiritual practice can
provide these benefits or blessings fully, generating profound faith and
motivation in others. It is therefore natural to wish for a virtuous
friend with a complete set of these attributes.</p>
<p>The second quality of freedom contains two aspects: a person’s lifestyle
and a person’s inner spiritual freedom. {580}</p>
<p>This quality of freedom is vital and is connected to the descriptions
above on monks who fraternize with the laypeople. If someone is shackled
by the same bonds and fetters as others, or is caught in the same
whirlpools and turbulent waters, he will not be able to help himself,
let alone help release or liberate others.</p>
<p>Someone who is subject to social constrictions and struggles to obtain
things in a worldly way and with worldly values, is under pressure to
make a living and support his family. He needs to fight for his own
survival and that of his family, in the same way as other people.
Whenever there is trouble in society, it will be difficult for him to
find time to devote himself to save others or to lead them in a new
direction. His attempts to help tend to fall in the category of
‘paddling around in a small pond’. When this person lacks freedom both
in lifestyle and inwardly it is even more difficult to achieve success
in helping others.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the Buddha established the monastic sangha as
an independent community, which has a way of life free from the
constraints of the wider society and is guided by the disciplinary code
of the Vinaya.</p>
<p>When this independent way of life is combined with individuals whose
minds are liberated, the sangha becomes a powerful force in generating
virtuous qualities in the wider society and acts as a refuge for the
public, enabling other people to also discover various levels of
freedom.</p>
<p>On the subject of assisting others, the Buddha gave the following
teaching:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Cunda, that one who is himself sinking in deep mud should pull out
another who is sinking in deep mud is impossible. That one who is not
himself sinking in mud should pull out another who is sinking in mud
is possible.</p>
<p>That one who is himself untrained, undisciplined, with defilements
unextinguished, should train another, discipline him, and help
extinguish his defilements is impossible. That one who is himself
trained, disciplined, with defilements extinguished, should train
another, discipline him, and help extinguish his defilements is
possible.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn36">36</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. I. 45.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha aimed to ensure for the stable and long-lasting independence
of the monastic sangha. In this context, the following teaching can be
determined as a code of ethics for renunciants:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A renunciant should not be overly busy, acting indiscriminately; he
should not be the man of someone else. Not in dependence on another
should he live, nor go about treating the Dhamma as a commodity.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn37">37</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Ud. 66.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This matter can be summed up by looking at the peerless attributes of
the Buddha himself, who was the supreme virtuous friend. The Buddha was
endowed with both qualities: he was truly accomplished and had realized
those things he taught; and he was free, liberated from both social
constraints and from the oppression of mental defilement. {581}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, just as a blue, red, or white lotus is born in the water and
grows up in the water, but having risen up above the water, it stands
unsullied by the water, so too the Tathāgata was born in the world and
grew up in the world, but having risen above the world, he dwells
untarnished by the world.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn38">38</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. III. 140-41.</em></p>
<p>See here, Bāhuna, the Tathāgata is free, detached, and released from
ten things and thus dwells with a boundless mind. What ten? Here, the
Tathāgata is free, detached, and released from physical form ...
feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness ...
from birth ... old age ... death ... from all suffering ... and from
all mental impurity, and thus dwells with a boundless mind. In the
same way, a blue, red, or white lotus is born in the water and grows
up in the water, but having risen up above the water, it stands
unsullied by the water.</p>
<p><em>A. V. 152.</em></p>
<p>The Blessed One is awakened himself and thus teaches the Dhamma for
the sake of awakening. The Blessed One has trained himself and thus
teaches the Dhamma for the sake of training. The Blessed One is at
peace himself and thus teaches the Dhamma for the sake of peace. The
Blessed One has crossed over himself and thus teaches the Dhamma for
crossing over. The Blessed One is completely quenched himself and thus
teaches the Dhamma for extinguishment.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn39">39</a></sup></p>
<p><em>D. III. 53-4; M. I. 235.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The following three characteristics of the Buddha’s teaching style,
which are referred to as the ‘Buddha’s mode of teaching’, can be used as
general principles of self-assessment for those people who act as
virtuous friends and instruct others:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn40">40</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Buddha teaches the Dhamma through direct knowledge. He teaches
those things worthy of realization that he himself has realized in
order that others too may realize these things. This principle
focuses on the teacher – on the fact that he or she truly
understands or has realized the subject being taught.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Buddha teaches the Dhamma with a sound basis. He teaches and
explains in a coherent way, so that the persons listening are able
to contemplate the subject and understand it by applying their own
wisdom. This principle focuses on the pupils or the listeners. The
teacher instructs in a way that provides the listeners with the
freedom or the opportunity to reflect, apply discernment, develop
wisdom, and penetrate the truth by themselves. The teacher merely
presents facts, information, reasoned arguments, or suggestions in
order to bring aspects of truth to light and to stimulate
contemplation in the listener.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Buddha teaches the Dhamma with real, wondrous results. He
teaches those things which are true – which are acknowledged by
those wise persons and lovers of truth who contemplate them. He
teaches those things that are realizable; practitioners will attain
those fruits corresponding and appropriate to their application in
practice. This principle focuses on the teaching, which is in accord
with truth or ‘truly so’; it is verifiable, effective, and worthy;
it is not trivial, futile or followed in vain; it produces real
results for those who practise it – the fruits of practice match
the effort made by the practitioner and by accompanying conditional
factors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If one is unable to find a virtuous friend who is realized and truly
free, it can still be useful to follow and learn from someone who
possesses great learning, despite the fact that he or she has not yet
reached the gist of the teaching. {582}</p>
<p>In this case, such a person is like a cowherd who looks after the cows
belonging to someone else, or like a blind person who carries a lantern
– a person with good vision is thus able to see.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup> A person with
good vision here refers to someone endowed with wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>).</p>
<p>This is not only the case with someone who has vast knowledge and is a
highly skilled teacher – even the speech of a simpleton or someone who
parrots the wise words of others can provide food for thought. A person
with wise reflection may hear these words and consequently attain
realization.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn42">42</a></sup></p>
<p>In these circumstances, however, the vital factor rests with the
listener, that is, he or she possesses the internal spiritual factor of
wise reflection, which will be discussed in a following chapter.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#responsibility-of-a-virtuous-friend" id="responsibility-of-a-virtuous-friend">Responsibility of a Virtuous Friend</a></h2>
<p>In the context of spiritual training, the participation and support by a
good companion in various activities is an external condition. An
important factor here is the mutual influence people have on each other
in the area of thoughts, opinions, attitudes, values, and understanding,
which collectively are called ‘views’ (<em>diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
<p>If these ideas, attitudes, values, and forms of understanding are
incorrect and harmful, they are known as ‘wrong view’ (<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>),
while if they are correct, wholesome, and beneficial they are called
‘right view’ (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
<p>A person who encourages someone to have wrong view is a bad friend
(<em>pāpa-mitta</em>), while a person who encourages someone to have right view
is a good and true friend (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>).</p>
<p>Often a person’s mentors at home or school, for instance a person’s
parents and teachers, have less influence than the friends the person
plays and associates with. But it also happens frequently that a
person’s friends living nearby have less influence than the people who
live far away (both in physical distance and in time) and who possess
the power to reach a person’s heart: the ‘companions’ who travel via the
mass media, say through channels of entertainment and books, including
biographies of great people, whose qualities one emulates.</p>
<p>The factor allowing someone to exert an influence on others, or the
bridge between the external companion and another person’s mind, is
belief, confidence, admiration, and inspiration, which together are
referred to as ‘faith’ (<em>saddhā</em>).</p>
<p>When faith is generated, one can be influenced by another even though he
or she lives far away and is not a close associate. Some people may live
close to home, but if one has no confidence in them they will have
little influence. Therefore, those who have the responsibility of
instructing others and imparting right view should first generate faith
and confidence in others.</p>
<p>A basic principle in spiritual training is for a virtuous friend to act
as a catalyst for faith: association with wise and honest people is a
condition for the arising of faith.</p>
<p>Although one may be good and wise, if one is unable to generate faith
and confidence in others, one still does not qualify as a ‘virtuous
friend’ (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>), nor has a true connection with others been
established. When faith is generated and another person is receptive,
one can help guide the person’s thoughts and behaviour (initially the
person may simply imitate one’s behaviour), or one can engender a
correct form of thinking, which is another level of spiritual practice.
The decisive factor determining whether one fulfils the responsibility
of a ‘virtuous friend’ is whether the person one associates with arrives
at right view. {583}</p>
<p>A technical and doctrinal explanation of right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>)
will be presented in a following chapter.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn43">43</a></sup> As an introduction it is
useful here to point out that the virtuous and correct views, opinions,
values, and forms of understanding which are collectively called ‘right
view’ have many details and particulars, and may be explained in many
different ways. An examination of the formal teachings, however, reveals
that these views, etc. can be distilled into two kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Beliefs, views, perspectives, and forms of understanding which are
correct, wholesome, and rational, and which are related to matters
of ethics, to good and bad behaviour and to the corresponding fruits
of such actions, epitomized by the saying ‘ones reaps as one sows.’
Further examples of this kind of view are a trust in virtue, say the
merits of one’s mother and father, and a belief in line with a
religious teaching, say the teaching on the next life. In brief, one
can define this as a view in accord with Dhamma or a belief in the
law of kamma, which engenders a sense of responsibility in regard to
one’s actions. The precise term for this view is <em>kammassakatā-ñāṇa</em>
– the knowledge of being an owner of one’s deeds.</p>
<p>This is mundane right view (<em>lokiya-sammādiṭṭhi</em>), arising from an
understanding of cause and effect and instilled by teachings passed
down in one’s community. It generates righteous, virtuous behaviour
and leads to a peaceful, well-ordered society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Views and forms of understanding about the world, about life, or
about conditioned phenomena which accord with truth, which accord
with the true nature of phenomena and with the natural law of
causality. By this understanding a person recognizes how to relate
to things in the world correctly.</p>
<p>For example, one understands that all conditioned things arise from
the convergence of interconnected factors; they exist according to
the interrelationship of causes and conditions, and therefore they
are unstable, impermanent, and unsustainable. Their associated
factors are in a constant state of conflict and pressure; these
things are not truly independent, they cannot be truly owned by
anyone, and they are ultimately not subject to anyone’s desires and
wishes. When things exist in this way, how should we relate to them?
Is it appropriate to be totally engrossed with conditioned things or
to dedicate one’s life to pursuing them? Every human being too is a
conditioned phenomenon and subject to the same natural laws; we are
all companions in old age, sickness, and death. As a consequence,
how should we relate to one another?</p>
<p>This form of understanding arises through proper discernment,
reflection and consideration of things, in accord with reality and
with the causal nature of things. It is called ‘right view aligned
with transcendent understanding’. Although at the beginning it is
still a mundane form of understanding, it is on the path to and will
develop into transcendent right view (<em>lokuttara-sammādiṭṭhi</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first kind of right view is called <em>kammassakatā-sammādiṭṭhi</em> or
<em>kammassakatā-ñāṇa</em>: the knowledge of how people are the owners of their
intentional actions (<em>kamma</em>). This is the ability to recognize and
distinguish one’s own volitional actions. This knowledge generates a
sense of responsibility in respect to one’s actions. It is right view on
the level of righteous conduct (<em>dhamma-cariyā</em>) or in relation to the
wholesome courses of action (<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>). It is a benefit or a
goal on both the immediate, mundane level (<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>) and the
refined, spiritual level (<em>samparāyikattha</em>), and it is the basis for
the supreme good (<em>paramattha</em>).</p>
<p>The second kind of right view is classified as ‘insight right view’
(<em>vipassanā-sammādiṭṭhi</em>). In the Pali Canon it is referred to as
<em>saccānulomika-ñāṇa</em>: ‘knowledge consistent with truth’ or ‘knowledge in
line with truth’. It leads to awakening; it leads directly to the
supreme good.</p>
<p>It is evident here that the essential kind of right view, leading to the
highest goal of Buddhism, is the second kind, of knowledge in line with
truth. {584}</p>
<p>All Buddhists, regardless of whether they aim directly for this highest
goal or not, should be careful not to stop at the first kind of right
view. Rather, they should advance to the second kind, by cultivating
this form of wisdom, at least to an initial degree.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn44">44</a></sup> This is because
this kind of right view reduces and alleviates greed, hatred and
delusion; it helps to establish an improved relationship to the world,
it makes the mind clear and bright, and it increases happiness. It
reduces oppression, conflict and distress in the world more effectively
than by using the method of restraint and control that is inherent in a
moral discipline. It benefits both an individual and society as a whole.</p>
<p>When one analyzes the sequence of events, one sees that the association
with good persons, or to have a virtuous friend, leads to the
opportunity to hear the Dhamma – to receive teachings – either
directly or indirectly. When the teaching of Dhamma truly conforms to
the principles of truth and goodness, and the teaching is presented in a
well-reasoned, coherent way, faith will arise in the person who receives
the teaching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Association with a wise person (to have a ‘virtuous friend’) →<br />
to listen to the Dhamma →<br />
faith.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn45">45</a></sup></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we come to a vital point in spiritual training or practice: the
connection between an external, social factor and an internal, personal
factor. The external factor is ‘learning from others’ (<em>paratoghosa</em>),
here meaning to have a virtuous friend (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>). On its own it
results in faith and leads only to ‘mundane right view’
(<em>lokiya-sammādiṭṭhi</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn46">46</a></sup> {585}</p>
<p>If one only reaches this stage then one’s spiritual training is
incomplete and one will not reach the highest goal of Buddhism. When one
abides only at the level of faith, one still relies on one’s teachers –
one’s ‘virtuous friends’ – and one’s behaviour is still one of
following an example or of imitation. One has not yet gained deep
knowledge and clear vision; one has still not reached complete
liberation.</p>
<p>The solution is to find a bridge to arrive at the internal, personal
factor of wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>). A person should summon
and generate wise reflection to replace faith, because wise reflection
leads to transcendent right view, to true knowledge, and to the supreme
goal of Buddhism.</p>
<p>The external factor of a virtuous friend enables this link to the
internal factor of wise reflection, and it is considered a
responsibility of a virtuous friend to help others generate wise
reflection within themselves. A good teacher should not settle for the
target of generating faith in the student, but should use this faith to
‘light the spark’ of wise reflection.</p>
<p>A good teacher uses faith as a link in teaching the Dhamma: having
instilled confidence he or she teaches the Dhamma so that the listener
or pupil rouses wise reflection: the ability to reflect and to see all
things according to the truth and in line with causality.</p>
<p>Once wise reflection has been generated, the natural process of
awakening unfolds until it reaches its culmination. During this time the
virtuous friend may help support and guide this wise reflection by
offering regular Dhamma teachings.</p>
<p>When the external factor is linked to the internal factor – when
learning from others supports wise reflection – the unawakened person
who is receptive to teaching is able to advance in Dhamma training and
practice (unless one is a prodigy who initiates wise reflection
spontaneously or one is a simpleton who is unable to think for oneself).</p>
<p>In Buddha-Dhamma, a virtuous teacher does not assist others in order to
foster devotion or a personal attachment, as such a relationship may
only lead to copying the teacher’s beliefs and conduct. A virtuous
friend acts not so that others form a personal relationship with the
teacher, but acts merely as a medium, to help others connect to their
own lives and their surroundings – to point out how they may reflect
upon things according to truth and discover for themselves how to relate
to the world correctly. The process is expanded thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Association with a wise person (to have a ‘virtuous friend’) →<br />
to listen to the Dhamma →<br />
faith →<br />
wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the teaching on wisdom development, or among the factors leading to
stream-entry, however, the Buddha does not mention faith. It may be that
in this context he considered faith to be a minor or subsidiary factor,
and that it does not require emphasis. {586}</p>
<p>The process of wisdom development, or the process involving the factors
leading to stream-entry, is illustrated thus:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn47">47</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Association with a wise person (to have a ‘virtuous friend’) →<br />
listening to the Dhamma →<br />
wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) →<br />
practice conforming to truth.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although they do not explicitly mention wise reflection, the following
sutta passages describe the style of instruction of virtuous friends,
who provide an independence to their pupils, allowing them to realize
the truth by themselves:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Māgaṇḍiya:</em> I have such confidence in Master Gotama. Now is Master
Gotama capable of teaching me the Dhamma in such a way that I might
rise up from this seat cured of my blindness?</p>
<p><em>The Buddha:</em> Then, Māgaṇḍiya, associate with virtuous people. When
you associate with virtuous people, you will hear the true Dhamma.
When you hear the true Dhamma, you will practise in accord with the
true Dhamma. When you practise in accord with the true Dhamma, you
will know and see for yourself thus: ‘These are the diseases, tumours,
and piercing darts [of the mind]; but here these diseases, tumours,
and darts cease without remainder. [That is] with the cessation of
one’s clinging comes cessation of becoming. With the cessation of
becoming ... sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair cease. Such
is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.’</p>
<p><em>M. I. 512.</em></p>
<p><em>Brahman Dhotaka:</em> I bow down and honour you, Sir, he who possesses
the eye of wisdom, the All-Seeing One. Please, Man of Sākya, free me
from confusion!</p>
<p><em>The Buddha:</em> See here, Dhotaka, I am not able to free anyone in the
world from confusion. When you have clearly understood the sublime
Dhamma, you will cross over the ocean of defilements by yourself.</p>
<p><em>Sn. 204-5; Nd. II. 20-21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the case that a virtuous friend has fulfilled the initial
responsibility of recognizing the vital independence of other
practitioners, it is then important for him or her to emphasize the
personal duties of these practitioners, so that they benefit in the
optimum way from this independence.</p>
<p>The Buddha therefore performed another responsibility of a virtuous
friend, that of enjoining his disciples to perform their personal duties
well, as can be seen by the numerous teachings he gave on listening to
the Dhamma, conversing on the Dhamma, and seeking guidance and advice.
For example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, when listening to the true Dhamma, a person endowed with five
qualities is capable of entering upon the fixed course [consisting
in] rightness in wholesome qualities. What five?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He does not think disparagingly about the subject being discussed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He does not think disparagingly about the speaker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He does not think disparagingly about himself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is not distracted; he listens to the Dhamma with one-pointed
attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He reflects wisely.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn48">48</a></sup> {587}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>A. III. 174-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The vital quality here is wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), which
is the agent giving rise to knowledge and understanding. This quality
does not only pertain to listening to the Dhamma or to verbal
instruction. Rather, it should be applied to every aspect of one’s life
and in every circumstance, including to one’s perception of sense
impressions and to one’s interaction with phenomena.</p>
<p>Wise reflection as a primary agent in spiritual development, taking over
from the instruction received from a virtuous friend, is the subject of
a following chapter. But before finishing this section on the influence
by others (<em>paratoghosa</em>), it seems appropriate to speak some more on
the subject of faith (<em>saddhā</em>), which is a key factor in the discussion
so far. The focus here will be on the proper role and practice of faith
in the course of bringing suffering to cessation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn49">49</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-1-four-bases-of-social-solidarity-saṅgaha-vatthu" id="appendix-1-four-bases-of-social-solidarity-saṅgaha-vatthu">Appendix 1: Four Bases of Social Solidarity (saṅgaha-vatthu)</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dāna</em>: giving; generosity; charity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Piyavācā</em>: kindly speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Atthacariyā</em>: life of service; beneficial conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samānattatā</em>: even and equal treatment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This key teaching on the four bases of social solidarity is found
frequently in the Pali Canon.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn50">50</a></sup> One example of the importance the
Buddha gave to mutual assistance and to social harmony is the story of
Hatthaka Āḷavaka, whom the Buddha praised as one of the two ‘mastheads’
of the assembly of laymen, and who was declared foremost among those who
support and protect a following by means of the four bases of social
solidarity.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn51">51</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Siṅgālaka Sutta, when the Buddha describes honouring the six
directions within the ‘noble discipline’ (<em>ariya-vinaya</em>), he concludes
with these four bases of social solidarity.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentaries define the term <em>rājā</em> (’king’, ‘majesty’) as someone
who gladdens the people by way of the four bases of solidarity,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn53">53</a></sup> and
state that these four bases of solidarity are a form of ‘sublime
conduct’ (<em>brahmacariya</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn54">54</a></sup></p>
<p>The last factor – <em>samānattatā</em> – can cause some problems in
interpretation because the origin of this word is unclear and it is
translated in different ways. The term <em>samāna</em> means ‘even’, ‘equal’,
or ‘common’, and thus the term <em>samānattatā</em> is often translated as
‘equal to oneself’ or ‘in common with oneself’ (i.e. to do onto others
as one would wish them to do onto you). The commentaries generally
translate this latter term as ‘in good times and in bad’ (i.e. to be
constant), or as equality and impartiality, expressed for example by
eating or sitting together;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn55">55</a></sup> it is related to the term
<em>samāna-kicca</em>, which means ‘to work together’ or ‘to help one another
accomplish a task’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentary to the Paṭisambhidāmagga gives an alternative definition
for <em>samānattatā</em>, stating that it means ‘proper discrimination’ or ‘to
place oneself in a correct relationship’, i.e. to act appropriately in
respect to another’s status, as lower, equal, or higher than
oneself.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn57">57</a></sup> The Jātaka commentaries offer yet another definition,
stating that it means ‘to be consistent’: not to act one way in private
and another way in public, for example to be respectful to one’s parents
irrespective of whether one is at home or in a public gathering.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn58">58</a></sup></p>
<p>At the highest level, the Buddha acknowledged the equality among those
of similar states of realization.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn59">59</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-2-commentarial-analysis-of-right-view-sammā-diṭṭhi" id="appendix-2-commentarial-analysis-of-right-view-sammā-diṭṭhi">Appendix 2: Commentarial Analysis of Right View (sammā-diṭṭhi)</a></h2>
<p>The commentaries provide a more detailed analysis of right view,
dividing it into five kinds:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn60">60</a></sup> <em>kammassakatā-sammādiṭṭhi</em>,
<em>jhāna-sammādiṭṭhi</em>, <em>vipassanā-sammādiṭṭhi</em>, <em>magga-sammādiṭṭhi</em>, and
<em>phala-sammādiṭṭhi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn61">61</a></sup> The first three kinds are mundane; the last
two are transcendent. Of the two kinds of right view mentioned in
section 5 above (’The Responsibility of a Virtuous Friend’), the first
is equivalent to <em>kammassakatā-sammādiṭṭhi</em>, while the second is
classified as <em>vipassanā-sammādiṭṭhi</em>. Both of these kinds of right view
are thus mundane. The difference is that <em>vipassanā-sammādiṭṭhi</em> leads
to <em>magga-sammādiṭṭhi</em> and <em>phala-sammādiṭṭhi</em>, which are transcendent,
and therefore it is referred to as ‘right view on the path to
transcendence’.</p>
<p>A familiar example of <em>kammassakatā-ñāṇa</em> (or
<em>kammassakatā-sammādiṭṭhi</em>) is the factor of right view in the teaching
on righteous conduct (<em>dhamma-cariyā</em>) or the ten wholesome courses of
action (<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn62">62</a></sup> This is a form of right view found
both within and outside Buddhism, and it existed even before the time of
the Buddha, that is, it is a part of all religious teachings that
espouse the doctrine of kamma. (No matter what teaching is upheld, in
whichever religious tradition, if this teaching accords with truth,
Buddhism acknowledges and accepts it.) For more on this subject see the
commentaries to the Vinaya Piṭaka and the Majjhima Nikāya.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn63">63</a></sup> The
second of these two commentaries reiterates that both
<em>kammassakatā-ñāṇa</em> and <em>saccānulomika-ñāṇa</em> are mundane forms of right
view. <em>Saccānulomika-ñāṇa</em> is ‘knowledge consistent with truth’ or
‘knowledge in line with truth’;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn64">64</a></sup> it is equivalent to
<em>vipassanā-ñāṇa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn65">65</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, a passage from the commentary to the Majjhima Nikāya
presents a different division of fivefold <em>sammādiṭṭhi</em>, namely:
<em>vipassanā-sammādiṭṭhi</em>, <em>kammassakatā-sammādiṭṭhi</em>,
<em>magga-sammādiṭṭhi</em>, <em>phala-sammādiṭṭhi</em>, and
<em>paccavekkhaṇa-sammādiṭṭhi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn66">66</a></sup> Here, <em>jhāna-sammādiṭṭhi</em> is removed
and replaced by <em>paccavekkhaṇa-sammādiṭṭhi</em>. <em>Jhāna-sammādiṭṭhi</em> is also
a form of mundane right view, but it pertains to those individuals who
have achieved jhāna and is not directly related to the subject at hand.
<em>Paccavekkhaṇa-sammādiṭṭhi</em> (right view stemming from reflection) is
equivalent to ‘right knowledge’ (<em>sammā-ñāṇa</em>) and pertains to those
individuals who have realized path and fruit; it too is classified as a
mundane form of right view.</p>

activities’, for example by acting as a messenger or a scout, like a
royal official (UdA. 334). ‘Should not be the man of someone else’
means to not be someone’s servant or subordinate.</p>

<p>This is one part of a sequence presented at A. V. 114. In Pali it
reads: <em>sappurisa-saṁseva</em> → <em>saddhamma-savana</em> → <em>saddhā</em>. At A. V.
145-9 there is a passage describing a process of relinquishment,
which includes the teaching: ‘When one has a virtuous friend one is
able to eliminate a lack of faith, narrow-mindedness, and
indolence.’ Later texts like the Visuddhimagga apply this teaching
to explain the nature of faith, stating: ‘Faith may have a factor of
stream-entry, like association with the virtuous, as a proximate
cause’ (Vism. 464; DhsA. 119; NdA. I. 55).</p>

<p>The virtues conducive to the growth of wisdom
(<em>paññāvuḍḍhi-dhamma</em>; factors conducive to wisdom development) are
sometimes abbreviated to the four factors for growth (<em>vuḍḍhi</em>;
<em>vuḍḍhi-dhamma</em>). They are equivalent to the four factors of
stream-entry (<em>sotāpattiyaṅga</em>): <em>sappurisa-saṁseva</em>,
<em>saddhamma-savana</em>, <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>, and
<em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em> (practice in accord with the Dhamma).
Many of the sources of these teachings have been cited earlier,
including: D. III. 227; S. V. 347, 404, 410-11; A. II. 245-6; cf.:
D. II. 214. These virtues are found in teachings throughout the
Tipiṭaka, as if the Buddha was looking for opportunities to mention
them. Another potent teaching in this context occurs at Kh. 7.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="fn48"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">48</sup>
<p>This sutta passage is followed by two similar passages, in which
some of the factors above are replaced by the following factors: ‘he
is wise, not a dimwit’; ‘he does not listen with contempt’; ‘he does
not listen with a sense of competitiveness’; ‘he does not listen by
looking to find fault, with a heart hardened towards the speaker’;
and ‘he does not presume to understand that which he has not yet
understood.’ These three suttas also describe the opposite qualities
to those mentioned in each passage. These positive qualities are
found in many passages throughout the Tipiṭaka.</p>

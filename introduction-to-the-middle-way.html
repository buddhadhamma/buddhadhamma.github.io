<p>The Middle Way (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>), also known as the Path (<em>magga</em>,
i.e. the fourth Noble Truth), embodies a set of principles for Buddhist
practice: it is a complete code of Buddhist conduct. It comprises the
practical teachings, based on an understanding of Buddhist theoretical
teachings, which guide people to the goal of Buddhism according to
natural processes. It is a way of actualizing the teachings in one’s own
life, a method of applying natural laws and benefitting from them to the
highest degree. To gain an initial understanding of the Middle Way, let
us consider this teaching by the Buddha from the first sermon, the
Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta:</p>
<h3 id="the-path-as-the-middle-way"><a class="header" href="#the-path-as-the-middle-way">The Path as the Middle Way</a></h3>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, these two extremes should not be followed by one who has gone
forth into homelessness. What two? The indulgence in sensual happiness
in sense pleasures, which is inferior, vulgar, low, ignoble, and
hollow; and the pursuit of self-mortification, which is painful,
ignoble, unbeneficial. The Tathāgata has awakened to the Middle Way,
which does not get caught up in either of these extremes, which gives
rise to vision, which gives rise to knowledge, which leads to peace,
to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>And what is that Middle Way (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>)…? It is this Noble
Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right thought, right speech,
right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right
concentration.</p>
<p><em>V. I. 10; S. V. 421.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This teaching provides a complete summary of the meaning, essence, and
purpose of the Middle Way. Note that it is a ’middle’ way, or ’middle’
path, because it does not get caught up in either of the two extremes
(note, however, that this should not be understood to mean that the path
lies between these two extremes):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Kāma-sukhallikānuyoga</em>: indulgence in sensual pleasures; the
extreme of sensual indulgence; extreme hedonism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Atta-kilamathānuyoga</em>: the extreme of self-mortification; extreme
asceticism.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Occasionally, Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike give the expression the
’middle way’ a very broad meaning, to denote an action or thought that
lies between two opposing actions or thoughts, or between actions and
thoughts performed and held by two separate people or parties.</p>
<p>This kind of midpoint or middle way does not have any solid basis; one
must wait until two opposing parties arise in order to determine the
halfway point, which hinges on the degree of belief or practice of these
two factions. The midway shifts according to the changing stances of the
two sides. Sometimes this kind of middle way appears to be the same as
the Middle Way in Buddhism (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>), but in fact it is
counterfeit. {526}</p>
<p>The true Middle Way has definite criteria. The validity of the Middle
Way rests with it having a clearly defined objective or goal. With the
goal clearly defined, the path leading to this goal, or conduct that is
apt, correct, and fruitful, is the Middle Way.</p>
<p>This is similar to shooting an arrow or a gun – it is necessary to have
a clear target. Accurate or correct shooting is any action expedient to
having the arrow or bullet reach the target. The ’middle way’ in this
context is shooting precisely and directly at the target.</p>
<p>All deviating shots, veering off to any number of directions, are flawed
and inaccurate. In contrast to these errant shots, one sees that there
is only one target, which is directly in the middle and clearly defined,
and the path leading to the target likewise is a middle path.</p>
<p>The correct path has its own true goal, which is not determined by
trajectories of the errant shots. The Middle Way has the definite goal
of liberation – the end of suffering.</p>
<p>The Path (<em>magga</em>) – the system of thought, action, and conduct that is
consistent with and effective in regard to this goal – is thus the
’Middle Way’ (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>).</p>
<p>Because the Middle Way has a clearly defined goal, or because the Middle
Way is dependent on having such a goal, a Dhamma practitioner must know
this goal in order to walk on the Path – one must know in which
direction one is going. For this reason the Middle Way is a path of
wisdom and begins with right view: it begins with an understanding of
one’s problems and of one’s destination. It is a path of understanding,
reason, and acceptance, and requires courage to face the truth.</p>
<p>When people possess this knowledge and courage, they are able to manage
their lives on their own, to live a correct and virtuous life
independently, without relying on external sacred, supernatural, or
divine powers. And when people have developed confidence based on their
own wisdom, they need not get caught up in and worried about things they
believe to exist outside of the normal human sphere. This confidence is
one attribute of the Middle Way.</p>
<p>When one understands one’s problems and the way to the goal, a traveller
on the Path gains the additional understanding that the Middle Way gives
value to one’s life. There is more to life than succumbing to worldly
currents, being enslaved by material enticements, or wishing solely for
delicious sensual pleasures, by allowing one’s happiness, virtue, and
value to be utterly dependent on material things and the fluctuations of
external factors. Instead, one cultivates freedom and self-assurance,
and one recognizes one’s own inherent value.</p>
<p>Besides not inclining towards the extreme of materialism, to the point
of enslavement and dependency on material things, the Middle Way also
does not incline towards spiritual extremes. It does not teach that all
things are exclusively dependent on effort and mental attainments, to
the point that one abandons material things and neglects one’s body,
resulting in a form of self-mortification. {527}</p>
<p>Conduct in accord with the Middle Way is characterized by
non-oppression, both towards others and oneself, and by an understanding
of phenomena, both material and mental. One then practises with accurate
knowledge, in tune with causes and conditions, and conducive to bearing
fruit in accord with the goal. One does not practise simply to
experience pleasurable sense impressions or out of some naive belief
that things must be done in a particular way.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1-1"><a href="#fn-fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>If someone alludes to a middle way or to walking a middle path, one
should ask whether he or she understands the problems at hand and the
goal to which this path leads.</p>
<p>The principles of the Middle Way can be applied to all human work and
activity. Generally speaking, all human systems, traditions, academic
fields of study, institutions, and everyday activities, like formal
education, aim to solve problems, reduce suffering, and help people
realize higher forms of virtue. A proper relationship to these systems,
traditions, etc. requires an understanding of their objective, which is
to relate to them with wisdom and right view, in accord with the Middle
Way.</p>
<p>It is commonly apparent, however, that people often practise incorrectly
and do not understand the true objectives of these systems, procedures,
and activities.</p>
<p>Incorrect practice deviates in one of two ways: some people use these
systems and activities as an instrument or opportunity for
self-gratification, for instance in politics they use this system as a
way to seek material gain, fame, and power. They perform their function
and increase their formal knowledge in order to enrich themselves and to
achieve influential positions, to maximize their own comfort and
pleasure. They do not act in order to achieve the true objective of that
work or field of knowledge. Rather than having right view, they are
subject to wrong view (<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
<p>Another group of people are resolutely dedicated to work or study. They
raise money, muster inner strength, and sacrifice time with great
devotion, but they do not understand the true purpose of the activity –
they do not know, for example, what problems should be solved by
performing it. They end up wasting their time, money, and energy,
causing themselves trouble and fatigue in vain. This is another way of
lacking right view. {528}</p>
<p>The first group of people set their own objectives in order to gratify
craving. They do not act in accord with the true objective of the
activity or work. The second group of people simply act without
understanding the real purpose of their actions. These two groups fall
into two extremes. They do not walk the Middle Way and they generate
more problems for themselves.</p>
<p>Only when they are able to follow the Middle Way, acting with knowledge
conforming to the true objective of that particular activity, are they
able to successfully solve problems and eliminate suffering.</p>
<p>In sum, if one does not begin with right view, one does not access the
Middle Way; if one does not follow the Middle Way, one is not able to
reach the end of suffering. (See

<blockquote>
<p>Occasionally, people may use the expression ’middle way’ to denote
effort that is neither overly rigid nor overly slack, or work or
training that is performed neither with laziness nor by forceful
straining. Although in these contexts the expression ’middle way’ may
share some attributes with the Middle Way, it is not absolutely
correct. Even those people who follow the Middle Way may apply an
overly forceful amount of effort, or not enough effort, and thus not
realize the fruit of practice. In these circumstances, the Buddha used
the expression <em>viriya-samatā</em> to refer to correct effort (this term
means correct, balanced, or consistent effort; <em>samatā</em> = <em>samabhāva</em> =
evenness, balance, suitability, moderation, consistency); see: Vin. I.
181; A. III. 374-5.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when people are sure of walking the correct path, fully
confident and prepared, they are encouraged to muster all of their
strength and energy, even if they must surrender their life in the
process. For example, the Buddha himself was fearlessly determined on
the night of his awakening (A. I. 50). One should not confuse this
subject with the Middle Way.</p>

<p>Monks, I do not praise the wrong path, whether for a layperson or for

wrong path? It is: wrong view … wrong concentration.</p>

<p><em>M. I. 493-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These passages on right and wrong practice reveal how the Buddha
intended the Middle Way to be applicable to all people, both renunciants
and laity; it is a teaching to be realized and brought to completion by
everyone – monks and householders alike. {529}</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These passages show the importance of the relationship between people
and their social environment, which is a vital factor influencing and
supporting Buddhist practice. They show that in Buddhism one’s way of
life and spiritual practice is intimately connected to society.</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, just as the dawn is the forerunner and precursor of the rising
of the sun, so too, the fulfilment of wise reflection
(yoniso-manasikāra) is the forerunner and precursor for the arising of
the Noble Eightfold Path for a monk. It is to be expected of a monk
who has brought wise reflection to completion that he will develop and
cultivate the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 31.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This passage introduces the notion that, although social factors are
vital, one should not overlook the importance of spiritual factors
inherent in an individual. Both internal and external factors can be the
impetus for spiritual practice and conducting one’s life correctly. In
fact, these two factors are mutually supportive.</p>
<p>This passage emphasizes that correct spiritual practice, or a virtuous
life, results from the integration of these two factors. And progress on
the Path towards the highest goal of life is most successful when these
two factors serve and aid one another.</p>
<p>Note, however, that the teachings often give more emphasis to the social
factor of having virtuous companionship than to the internal factor of
wise reflection. There are passages, as the one above, which equate the
value of having good friends as equivalent to the entire practice of the
Buddhist teachings, referred to here as the ’holy life’
(<em>brahmacariya</em>). This is because most people must rely on social
factors in order to initiate right practice and a virtuous life, or to
begin on the noble path.</p>
<p>Moreover, wholesome social factors act as both the trigger for enabling
wise reflection and for the support for augmenting and advancing wise
reflection. {530}</p>
<p>There are very few exceptions to this rule, namely, those extraordinary
persons who can progress safely on the Path relying solely on their own
inherent spiritual endowment. They are able to commence with wise
reflection without outside influence and to constantly summon wise
reflection without relying on social factors.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn4-1"><a href="#fn-fn4">4</a></sup> These passages are
thus intended for the majority of people, who possess an average degree
of spiritual faculties.</p>
<p>This subject of social factors in relation to internal factors is very
important and will be addressed at more length in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p><em>A. III. 414-5; S. IV. 133.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Middle Way here is the way leading to the cessation of kamma. It is
very important, however, not to interpret this to mean the following:
that it simply refers to the passing away of the body, to dying;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn5-1"><a href="#fn-fn5">5</a></sup> or
that it refers to ending kamma by not producing kamma or not doing
anything at all, which is the doctrine of the Jains, as described in the
chapter on kamma; or that it refers to abandoning activity and living in
a state of passivity.</p>
<p>The ending of kamma requires activity and earnest endeavour, but it is
action in accord with the Middle Way, in accord with a proper method of
action, as opposed to errant behaviour.</p>
<p>And the expression ’cessation of kamma’ does not mean inactivity and
complacency, but rather an end to the actions of unawakened persons and
the start to actions of noble beings.</p>
<p>Ordinary people act with craving and grasping; they attach to personal
ideas of what is good and bad and to things providing some form of
personal advantage. The actions of such people are technically referred
to as ’kamma’, which is classified as either good or bad.</p>
<p>The end of kamma refers to ceasing to act with an attachment to personal
views of right and wrong and with a hunger for personal gain. When
personal attachments to right and wrong are absent, the subsequent
actions are not referred to as ’kamma’, because kamma requires taking
sides, requires for things to be either good or evil.</p>
<p>The actions of awakened beings, on the other hand, are in harmony with
the pure reason and objective of that particular activity; they are not
tied up with any craving or grasping.</p>
<p>Awakened persons do no wrong, because no more causes or conditions exist
which would compel them to misbehave; no greed, hatred, or delusion
remains in their minds which would drive them to seek personal gain.
They only perform good actions, acting solely with wisdom and
compassion. The term ’good’ here, however, is used according to the
understanding of general people. Awakened beings do not attach to the
ideas of personal goodness, or to goodness as some mark of personal
identity.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when ordinary people perform good deeds, they do not
act purely in accord with the true objective of such deeds, but tend to
expect some kind of personal reward as a result. On a subtle level this
may be a wish for personal prestige, or even a sense of internal
wellbeing that ’I’ have done good. {531}</p>
<p>Awakened persons, however, perform good acts purely in accord with the
purpose, objective, and necessity of such an action. Their actions are
thus technically not referred to as ’kamma’.</p>
<p>The Path is a way of practice for bringing an end to volitionally
produced actions (<em>kamma</em>); when kamma ceases only pure actions
(referred to as ’doing’ – <em>kiriyā</em>), following the guidance of wisdom,
remain.</p>
<p>This is the distinction between the mundane and the transcendent courses
of action. The Buddha and the arahants teach and act for the welfare of
all people without their actions constituting kamma. In the vernacular,
their actions are referred to simply as ’acts of goodness’.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monks, suppose a man in the course of a long journey saw a great
expanse of water, whose near shore was frightening and dangerous and
whose far shore was safe and free from danger, but there was no
ferryboat or bridge crossing to the other shore. Then he thought:
’There is this great expanse of water, whose near shore is frightening
and dangerous…. Suppose I collect grass, pieces of wood, branches,
and leaves and bind them together into a raft, and supported by the
raft and making an effort with my hands and feet, I got safely across
to the far shore.’</p>
<p>And then the man collected grass … and leaves and bound them
together into a raft … and got safely across to the far shore. Then,
when he had got across and had arrived at the far shore, he might
think thus: ’This raft has been very helpful to me, since supported by
it … I got safely across to the far shore. Suppose I were to hoist
it on my head or load it on my shoulders, and then go wherever I
want.’ Now, monks, what do you think? By doing so, would that man be
doing what should be done with that raft?’</p>
<p>[The monks replied, ’No, venerable sir’, and the Buddha continued:]</p>
<p>By doing what would that man be doing what should be done with that
raft? Here, monks, when that man got across and had arrived at the far
shore, he might think thus: ’This raft has been very helpful to me….
Suppose I were to haul it onto the dry land or tie it up at the
water’s edge, and then go wherever I want.’ Now, monks, it is by so
doing that that man would be doing what should be done with that raft.</p>
<p>The Dhamma is similar to a raft, which I have revealed to you for the
purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping. When you
thoroughly understand the Dhamma, which is similar to a raft as I have
illustrated, you should abandon even good states, not to mention bad
states.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 134-5.</em></p>
<p>Monks, purified and bright as this view is, if you adhere to it, are
enthralled by it, cherish it, and treat it as a possession, would you
then understand the Dhamma that has been taught as similar to a raft,
being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of
grasping?<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn6-1"><a href="#fn-fn6">6</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. I. 260-61.</em></p>

</div>
<p>These two passages caution against grasping at virtuous qualities
(including grasping at the truth or at what is right), by which a person
fails to benefit from their true value and objective. Moreover, they
emphasize viewing all virtuous qualities and all Dhamma teachings as
means or methods leading to a specific goal; they are neither arbitrary
nor are they ends in themselves. {532}</p>
<p>When practising a particular Dhamma teaching, it is important to realize
its objective, along with its relationship to other teachings. The term
’objective’ here does not only refer to the final goal, but also to the
vital function of that particular teaching or spiritual quality: to
know, for example, how cultivating a specific quality supports or
generates other qualities, what its limits are, and once its function is
complete, to know what other qualities take over responsibility.</p>
<p>This is similar to being on a journey, in which one must use different
vehicles at various stages to pass over land, water, and air. It is
insufficient to simply have a general idea of one’s destination. One
needs to know how far each vehicle can travel, and having reached a
location one knows which is the next vehicle to use.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn7-1"><a href="#fn-fn7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Spiritual practice lacking insight into these objectives, requirements,
and interrelationships is limited and obstructed. Even worse it leads
people off the right track, it misses the target, and it is stagnant,
futile and fruitless. Aimless spiritual practice causes
misunderstandings and harmful consequences. It undermines such important
spiritual qualities as contentment and equanimity.</p>

<p>The term <em>brahmacariya</em> is generally understood in a very narrow sense,
as living a renunciant life and the abstention from sexual intercourse,
which is only one meaning of this term. (See
Note <a href="#note-brahmacariya">Definitions of Brahmacariya</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Definitions of Brahmacariya</span><a id="note-brahmacariya"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The commentaries give twelve definitions for the term <em>brahmacariya</em>.
The common definitions include: the entire Buddhist religion; practice
according to the Eightfold Path; the four divine abidings
(<em>brahmavihāra</em>); generosity (<em>dāna</em>); contentment with one’s own
wife; celibacy; and exposition of the Dhamma (<em>dhamma-desanā</em>):
MA. II. 204. DA. I. 177 provides ten definitions; ItA. I. 109 provides
five definitions; KhA. 152 and SnA. I. 299 provide four definitions. The
Cūḷaniddesa defines <em>brahmacariya</em> as the abstention from sexual
intercourse (’unwholesome practice’ – <em>asaddhamma</em>) and adds: <em>Apica
nippariyāyena brahmacariyaṁ vuccati ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo</em> –
’moreover, generally speaking, the Eightfold Path is called the holy
life’ (Nd. II. 10, 48).</p>
<p>The Mahāniddesa defines <em>cara</em> as: <em>vihara</em> (’abide’, ’exist’);
<em>iriya</em> (’movement’); <em>vatta</em> (’go’, ’revolve’); <em>pāla</em> (’protect’);
<em>yapa</em> (’proceed’); <em>yāpa</em> (’nourish’, ’sustain life’). See, e.g.:
Nd. I. 51, 159, 314.</p>
<p>Here are the substantiated meanings of these words (<em>rūpa-siddhi</em>):
<em>cariya</em> (nt.) and <em>cariyā</em> (f.) stem from <em>cara</em> (root – <em>dhātu</em>) +
<em>ṇya</em> (affix – <em>paccaya</em>) + <em>i</em> (added syllable – <em>āgama</em>). <em>Cariya</em>
here is the same word used in the Thai compounds <em>cariya-sikkhā</em>
(จริยศึกษา – moral education) and <em>cariya-dhamma</em> (จริยธรรม –
virtuous conduct).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In fact, the Buddha used this term to refer to the entire system of
living life according to Buddhist principles or to Buddhism itself. This
is evident from the passages in which the Buddha sends forth his
disciples in order to ’proclaim the holy life’, and also in the passage
in which he states that the holy life will truly flourish when members
of the four assemblies – the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, laymen, and laywomen
– both renunciants (<em>brahmacārī</em>) and householders (<em>kāmabhogī</em> –
’those who enjoy sense pleasures’; those who have families) –
understand and practise the Dhamma well.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn9-1"><a href="#fn-fn9">9</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Brahmacariya</em> is made up of the terms <em>brahma</em> and <em>cariya</em>. <em>Brahma</em>
means ’excellent’, ’superior’, ’supreme’, ’pure’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn10-1"><a href="#fn-fn10">10</a></sup> <em>Cariya</em> is
derived from the root <em>cara</em>, which in a concrete sense means ’to
travel’, ’to proceed’, ’to wander’, and in an abstract sense it means
’behaviour’, ’to lead one’s life’, ’to conduct one’s life’, ’to exist’.
Here, we are interested in the figurative or abstract sense. (Note that
occasionally <em>brahmacariya</em> is written as <em>brahmacariyā</em>.) (See
Note <a href="#note-brahmacariya">Definitions of Brahmacariya</a> for further analysis.)</p>
<p>As a compound word <em>brahmacariya</em> thus means: excellent conduct;
excellent behaviour; pure, divine conduct (conduct resembling that of
the Brahma gods); leading one’s life in an excellent way; living in an
excellent way; or an excellent life.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn11-1"><a href="#fn-fn11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>The term <em>cariya-dhamma</em> (จริยธรรม) is a newly established word in the
Thai language. Although in Pali the word <em>cariya</em> occurs on its own,
there is no contradiction to add the word <em>dhamma</em>. <em>Cariya-dhamma</em> here
means ’upright conduct’, ’virtuous conduct’, or ’basis of conduct’. It
refers to principles of behaviour or principles of conducting one’s
life. Here, I will not discuss the wider academic notions of the term
<em>cariya-dhamma</em>, but focus simply on its Buddhist connotations. {534}</p>
<p>Adopting this new term, one can define <em>brahmacariya</em> as excellent
virtuous conduct – excellent <em>cariya-dhamma</em>. This excellent conduct,
or ’supreme’ (<em>brahma</em>) conduct, refers specifically to the system of
conduct revealed and proclaimed by the Buddha.</p>
<p>According to the Buddha’s words quoted above, the holy life – excellent
conduct or Buddhist conduct – is equivalent to the Path (<em>magga</em>) or to
the Middle Way (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>). Likewise, one who practises the
holy life (<em>brahmacārī</em>) – one whose conduct conforms to Buddhist
principles – lives according to the Path or practises in line with the
Middle Way.</p>
<p>The Buddhist teachings state that the Path – the Middle Way – is a
system of conduct, a system of practical application, a guideline for
living a virtuous life, or a way for people to lead their lives
correctly, which leads to the goal of freedom from suffering.</p>
<p>The following points provide a summary of <em>brahmacariya</em>: the holy life,
excellent conduct, or conduct conforming to the middle way of practice:</p>
<h4 id="virtuous-conduct"><a class="header" href="#virtuous-conduct">Virtuous conduct</a></h4>
<p>Virtuous conduct is connected to truth inherent in nature; it is based
on natural laws. It is a matter of applying knowledge about natural,
causal processes in order to benefit human beings, by establishing a
system of practice or a code of conduct, which is effective and in
harmony with these laws.</p>
<p>This harmony with nature can be viewed from two perspectives. First is
to focus on the source, that is, to see that virtuous conduct is
determined by natural truths. Second is to focus on the goal, to
recognize the purpose and objective for such conduct. One practises the
holy life in order to benefit oneself and all of humanity, to lead a
virtuous life, to foster goodness in society, to lead to the welfare and
happiness of all people.</p>
<p>In relation to society, for example, by wishing for people to live
together peacefully, one advocates and establishes principles of
behaviour, say on how to interact with others or how to act in relation
to one’s natural environment. These principles are established according
to the truth of human nature, which has certain requirements and
attributes dependent on other people and on the environment.</p>
<p>In terms of individuals, by wishing for people to be peaceful, bright,
happy, and mentally healthy, one teaches them how to control and direct
their thoughts and how to purify their minds. These methods of
generating wellbeing are established according to the universal nature
of the human mind, which is subject to causal, immaterial laws inherent
in nature. Wishing for people to experience the refined happiness of
jhāna and the highest levels of insight, one teaches them to train the
mind, to reflect, to relate to things properly, and to develop various
stages of wisdom. These methods of higher spiritual practice are
established according to the laws governing the functioning of the mind
and the laws of conditioned phenomena. {535}</p>
<p>The term <em>cariya-dhamma</em>, which is a synonym for <em>brahmacariya</em>,
encompasses all of these kinds of spiritual practice, which can be
divided into many different levels or stages. <em>Cariya-dhamma</em> can be
defined as applying an understanding of reality to establish wholesome
ways of living, so that people can realize the highest forms of
wellbeing.</p>
<h4 id="brahmacariya"><a class="header" href="#brahmacariya">Brahmacariya</a></h4>
<p><em>Brahmacariya</em> – excellent conduct, the Path, or the Middle Way – is
equivalent to the entire practical teachings of Buddhism. This term has
a much broader definition than the Thai term <em>sīla-dhamma</em> (ศีลธรรม –
’morality’, ’ethical behaviour’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn12-1"><a href="#fn-fn12">12</a></sup> In regard to its general
characteristics, subject matter, and objective, <em>sīla-dhamma</em> has a
narrower meaning. Generally speaking, <em>sīla-dhamma</em> refers to external
behaviour by way of body and speech, to non-harming, to abstaining from
bad actions, and to mutual assistance in society.</p>
<p>In terms of its content or subject matter, this latter term tends to be
limited to moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>): to restraint of body and speech, and
to expressions of the divine abidings, for instance lovingkindness and
compassion. Although it is connected to the mind, it does not include
the development of concentration or the cultivation of wisdom in order
to realize the truth of conditioned phenomena.</p>
<p>As to its objective, it emphasizes social wellbeing, peaceful
coexistence, worldly progress – say in terms of material gain,
reputation, and prestige – and being reborn in a happy realm. In short,
it is linked to human and divine prosperity (<em>sampatti</em>), to ’mundane
welfare’ (<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>), and to the beginning stages of
’spiritual welfare’ (<em>samparāyikattha</em>).</p>
<p>Here, we see that <em>sīla-dhamma</em> is equivalent to <em>sīla</em> – the term
<em>dhamma</em> is added simply for the sake of euphony.</p>
<h4 id="cariya-dhamma"><a class="header" href="#cariya-dhamma">Cariya-dhamma</a></h4>
<p>In Thailand, the term <em>cariya-dhamma</em> still causes confusion for people.
Some people understand this term as equivalent to <em>sīla-dhamma</em> – to
general morality, while others bestow on it an academic or philosophical
connotation. I will not go into these various definitions here.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say that similar to the term <em>sīla-dhamma</em>, which is
equivalent to <em>sīla</em>, <em>cariya-dhamma</em> is equivalent to <em>cariya</em>
(’conduct’, ’behaviour’) – the suffix <em>dhamma</em> does not alter its
meaning.</p>
<p>The term <em>cariya-dhamma</em> encompasses the entirety of Dhamma practice,
beginning with basic moral conduct. The following factors are included
in the principle of <em>cariya-dhamma</em>: moral conduct, developing good
family relationships, social harmony, observing precepts in a monastery
as a layperson, keeping the duties of a renunciant (<em>samaṇa-dhamma</em>) in
the forest, gladdening the mind, fostering mental health, mental
training, meditation, insight practice, etc.</p>
<p>As stated above, the term <em>brahmacariya</em>, which contains the term
<em>cariya</em>, refers to the Path or to the Middle Way, but it emphasizes
behaviour or the way in which one leads one’s life. In essence, the term
<em>brahmacariya</em> refers to a system of conducting one’s life with virtue,
or to the entire system of Dhamma practice in Buddhism, and it thus
incorporates the term <em>sīla-dhamma</em> as used in the Thai language. It
also includes the training of the mind, the instilling of virtue, and
the development of knowledge and vision (<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>), which is an
aspect of higher wisdom. {536}</p>
<p>In sum, <em>brahmacariya</em> refers to a means of cultivating virtue by way of
body, speech and mind, or from the perspective of the threefold
training, it is the complete training in moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>),
concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).</p>
<p>The goal of this excellent conduct is to realize every stage of Buddhist
spiritual practice, until one has reached the highest goal of the holy
life (<em>brahmacariya-pariyosāna</em>): the end of greed, hatred, and
delusion, the realization of true knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>), liberation
(<em>vimutti</em>), purity (<em>visuddhi</em>), and peace (<em>santi</em>). In sum, one
realizes Nibbāna.</p>
<p>For brevity’s sake, <em>brahmacariya</em> is translated here as the ’holy life’
or as ’living an excellent life’. Excellent conduct is not something
that can be formulated simply by the whims of influential people or by
the consensus of a group or community, and it is not something that
should be followed blindly. Establishing true excellent conduct, and
having such conduct bear fruit, is dependent on knowledge of reality.</p>
<h3 id="the-path-as-a-way-of-achieving-life-objectives"><a class="header" href="#the-path-as-a-way-of-achieving-life-objectives">The Path as a Way of Achieving Life Objectives</a></h3>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Your Majesty, I told the bhikkhu Ānanda: ’Ānanda … having good
friends, having good companions, and a delight in associating with
virtuous people is equivalent to the entire holy life. When a monk has
a good friend it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate
the Noble Eightfold Path….’ Therefore, great king, you should train
yourself thus: ’I will be one who has good friends, who has good
companions, and who delights in associating with virtuous people….’</p>
<p>When, great king, you have good friends, you should dwell by applying
this vital principle: heedfulness in respect to wholesome states. When
you are heedful and dwelling diligently, your retinue of harem women
… your nobles and royal entourage … your soldiers … and even the
townspeople and villagers will think thus: ’The king is heedful and
dwells diligently. Come now, let us also be heedful and dwell
diligently.’</p>
<p>When, great king, you are heedful and dwelling diligently, you
yourself will be guarded and protected, your retinue of harem women
will be guarded and protected, your treasury and storehouse will be
guarded and protected.</p>
<p>One who desires great, burgeoning riches should take great care;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The wise praise diligence performing meritorious deeds.<br />
The wise are heedful<br />
and thus secure both kinds of good (<em>attha</em>):<br />
The good visible in this very life<br />
And the good of the future.<br />
A wise person, by attaining the good,<br />
Is called a sage.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Appamāda Sutta: S. I. 87-9; cf.: A. III. 364.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The term <em>attha</em> (’good’) can also be translated as ’substance’,
’meaning’, ’objective’, ’benefit’, ’target’, or ’goal’. In this context
it means the true purpose or goal of life, referring to the goal of the
holy life or the goal of Buddhism. {537}</p>
<p>Most people know that the highest goal of Buddhism is Nibbāna, for which
there exists the epithet <em>paramattha</em>, meaning ’supreme good’ or
’supreme goal’. It is normal that when teaching Dhamma there is great
emphasis on practising in order to reach the highest goal.</p>
<p>Buddhism, however, does not overlook the secondary benefits or goals
which people may realize according to their individual level of
spiritual maturity, and these benefits are often clearly defined, as is
evident in the passage above.</p>
<p>As far as I can ascertain, the older texts divide spiritual good
(<em>attha</em>) into two categories, as seen in the passage above:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>: initial benefits; present good; good in this
lifetime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samparāyikattha</em>: profound benefits; future good; higher good.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this case, the supreme good (<em>paramattha</em>) is included in the second
factor of higher good (<em>samparāyikattha</em>): it is the apex of this second
form of spiritual benefit.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn13-1"><a href="#fn-fn13">13</a></sup> The authors of later texts, however,
wished to give special emphasis to the supreme good and thus
distinguished it as a separate factor, resulting in three levels of
spiritual benefit or spiritual goals:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn14-1"><a href="#fn-fn14">14</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>: present good; good in this lifetime; visible
benefits. This refers to basic or immediate goals, to obvious,
everyday benefits. It pertains to external or ordinary, mundane aims
and aspirations, like material gain, wealth, prestige, pleasure,
praise, social status, friendship, and a happy married life. It also
includes the righteous search for these things, a correct
relationship to them, the use of these things in a way that brings
happiness to oneself and others, communal harmony, and the
fulfilment of one’s social responsibilities which leads to communal
wellbeing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samparāyikattha</em>: future good; inconspicuous benefits; profound
benefits, which are not immediately visible. It pertains to a
person’s spiritual life or to the true value of human life; it
refers to higher goals, which act as a surety when one passes away
from this world, or are a guarantee for obtaining superior blessings
– superior gains – greater than one normally realizes in the
world. These benefits include: spiritual development and the
increase of virtuous qualities; an interest in moral conduct,
meritorious deeds, the cultivation of goodness, and actions based on
faith and relinquishment; a confidence in the power of virtue;
tranquillity and mental ease; the experience of refined happiness;
and the exceptional attributes of jhāna. (Originally, the supreme
benefit of awakening was also included in this term.)</p>
<p>A person who realizes these benefits is released from an attachment
to material things. One does not overvalue these things to the point
of grasping onto them, succumbing to them, or allowing them to be a
cause for doing evil. Instead, one gives value to virtue, acts with
a love of truth, cherishes a good quality of life, and delights in
spiritual development. Reaching this stage produces results that can
be used in conjunction with mundane benefits (<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>),
and which support oneself and others. For example, instead of using
money for seeking sensual pleasures, one uses it to assist others
and to enhance the quality of one’s life. {538}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paramattha</em>: supreme benefit; the true, essential good. This refers
to the highest goal, the final destination: realization of the
truth; a thorough knowledge of the nature of conditioned phenomena;
non-enslavement by the world; a free, joyous, and spacious mind; an
absence of oppression by personal attachments and fears; an absence
of defilements, which burn and corrupt the mind; a freedom from
suffering; a realization of internal happiness, which is completely
pure and accompanied by perfect peace, illumination, and joy. In
other words, this refers to liberation (<em>vimutti</em>): to Nibbāna.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Buddha acknowledged the importance of all the aforementioned
benefits or goals, recognizing that they are connected to an
individual’s level of lifestyle, profession, surroundings, and
proficiency, readiness, and maturity of spiritual faculties.</p>
<p>From the passage cited above, however, it is evident that according to
Buddhism all people should reach the second stage of benefits or goals.
It is good to have attained present, immediate benefits, but this is
insufficient – one should not rest here. One should progress and
realize at least some aspects of profound, spiritual benefits. A person
who has obtained the first two levels of benefits, or has reached the
first two goals, is praised as a <em>paṇḍita</em> – a person who lives wisely,
whose life is not meaningless and void.</p>
<p>The Buddha gave comprehensive practical teachings on how to reach all of
these benefits. On some occasions he gave a teaching on how to obtain
four kinds of immediate, visible benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Uṭṭhāna-sampadā</em>: perseverance; to know how to apply wisdom to
manage one’s affairs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ārakkha-sampadā</em>: to know how to protect one’s wealth and
possessions, so that they are safe and do not come to harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kalyāṇamittatā</em>: to associate with virtuous people, who support
one’s spiritual practice and development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samajīvitā</em>: to lead a balanced livelihood; to be happy without
needing to live lavishly; to keep one’s income greater than one’s
expenditures; to maintain savings; to economize.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly, he gave a teaching on how to obtain four kinds of profound,
spiritual benefits:</p>

<li>
<p><em>Sīla-sampadā</em>: to be endowed with moral conduct; to live virtuously

is suitable for one’s way of life.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>In regard to the supreme benefit or goal (<em>paramattha</em>), because it is
so difficult to understand and to realize, and also because it is the
unique factor distinguishing Buddhism from all previous religious
doctrines, it is natural that the Buddha gave it great emphasis. There
are teachings by the Buddha on the supreme goal spread throughout the
Tipiṭaka, and similarly in this text <em>Buddhadhamma</em> this theme has been
touched upon frequently. {539}</p>
<p>As for the first two levels of benefits, they have been adequately
taught by Buddhist scholars and teachers throughout the ages. The first
level – of mundane, immediate benefits – has been taught to lay
Buddhists as is suitable to their particular time period and location.
Buddhists have readily adopted any teaching in this context that is
effective and does not lead to a deviation from the Middle Way. Lay
Buddhists themselves are able to elaborate on and adapt these practices
as is appropriate to their circumstances.</p>
<p>In the above sutta passage the Buddha emphasizes the quality of
heedfulness (<em>appamāda</em>) as a factor which helps to realize all of the
aforementioned benefits. <em>Appamāda</em> can be defined as: an absence of
indifference, passivity, or neglect; attentiveness, diligence, and
ambition; being well-prepared and vigilant; hastening to do that which
should be done, adjust that which should be adjusted, and do that which
is good. A heedful person knows that diligence is a fundamental
spiritual quality, which leads to both immediate and future benefits.</p>
<p>There is the added stipulation here that heedfulness must be firmly
established on an association with virtuous people, on having good
friends, and on involving such people in one’s activities. Moreover, the
Buddha explains heedfulness here to mean ’diligence in regard to
wholesome states’ – to engaging in virtuous activities and ’performing
meritorious deeds’ (<em>puñña-kiriyā</em>).</p>
<p>The term <em>puñña-kiriyā</em> provides an interesting link to a related
subject. When the Buddha on certain occasions spoke about secondary
benefits or goals, he reduced his emphasis in relation to the supreme
goal. When the focus of the teaching was lowered to one of the secondary
goals, the level of practice that he recommended was also lowered or
relaxed.</p>
<p>This is the case not only in specific, isolated circumstances; it is
true also when he presented general, wide-ranging systems of practice.</p>
<p>We see this in a teaching the Buddha gave in reference to these three
stages of benefits. Here, instead of the practice being formulated
according to the gradual teaching of the threefold training – of
<em>sīla</em>, <em>samādhi</em>, and <em>paññā</em> – as is usual in those teachings
focusing primarily on the supreme goal, the system of practice is
restructured as the general teaching referred to as ’meritorious action’
(<em>puñña-kiriyā</em>) or the ’bases of meritorious action’
(<em>puññakiriyā-vatthu</em>).</p>
<p>In this teaching, there are likewise three factors, but with different
names.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn16-1"><a href="#fn-fn16">16</a></sup> They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dāna</em>: giving, relinquishment, generosity. The reasons for giving
are various: to help others who are poor, destitute, or in need; to
show goodwill in order to create trust, establish friendship, and
develop communal harmony; and to honour virtue, by praising,
encouraging and supporting good people. The things given are also
various: personal possessions, material objects, and requisites for
sustaining life; technical knowledge, advice, guidance on how to
live one’s life, or the gift of Dhamma; the opportunity to
participate in wholesome activities; and the gift of forgiveness
(<em>abhaya-dāna</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em>: virtuous conduct and earning one’s living honestly; moral
discipline and good manners. {540} The main emphasis here is on not
harming others and living together peacefully, by maintaining the
five precepts: not killing or injuring other beings; not violating
other people’s property or possessions; not violating those who are
cherished by others – not offending others by dishonouring them or
destroying their families; not harming or undermining others by
wrong or offensive speech; and not causing trouble for oneself by
taking addictive drugs which impair mindfulness and clear
comprehension – spiritual qualities that act as restraints,
preventing harm and preserving virtue.</p>
<p>In addition to the five precepts one may undertake a training in
abstaining from certain luxuries and pleasing sense objects, in
living simply and being less dependent on material things, by
keeping the eight or ten precepts at suitable times. Alternatively,
one may undertake various forms of public service and assistance
(<em>veyyāvacca-kamma</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhāvanā</em>: cultivation of the mind and of wisdom; to undergo mental
training in order to develop virtuous qualities, to strengthen and
stabilize the mind, and to generate wisdom which truly discerns
conditioned phenomena; to have a correct worldview or perspective on
life.</p>
<p>The cultivation referred to here is of both concentration and
wisdom, which in the threefold training is distinguished as
<em>samādhi-bhāvanā</em> (or <em>citta-bhāvanā</em>) and <em>paññā-bhāvanā</em>. Here,
the distinction between these two is not emphasized and they are
thus combined as a single factor. This factor encompasses a wide
range, including right effort (<em>sammā-vāyāma</em>) – the effort to
abandon mental defilements and to nurture wholesome qualities –
which is part of the <em>samādhi</em> group in the Eightfold Path, and both
right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>) and right thought (<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>) –
especially the cultivation of lovingkindness, the source of both
personal and social wellbeing – which are part of the wisdom group
in the Eightfold Path.</p>
<p>The practices recommended in the scriptures for developing this
combination of concentration and wisdom include: seeking wisdom and
clearing the mind by listening to the Dhamma (<em>dhamma-savana</em>; this
includes reading Dhamma books); reciting or teaching the Dhamma;
discussing the Dhamma; revising and correcting one’s beliefs, views,
and understanding; developing lovingkindness; and general methods of
restricting and subduing mental defilements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is evident that when the Buddha altered the focus of his teachings to
more basic aspects of life or to secondary spiritual achievements, he
adjusted the way one should live one’s life, or the system of Dhamma
practice, accordingly.</p>
<p>In this simplified system of practice he emphasizes physical and verbal
actions, human interactions, and social relationships, which are easy to
observe. The two factors of generosity (<em>dāna</em>) and virtuous conduct
(<em>sīla</em>) focus on mental development and refinement through the use of
basic, external actions as the means of practice. One applies these two
factors in order to eliminate coarse defilements.</p>
<p>Practice on the levels of concentration (or the ’higher mind’ –
<em>adhicitta</em>) and of wisdom (or ’higher wisdom’ – <em>adhipaññā</em>), on the
other hand, deals directly with internal, spiritual matters and is both
subtle and difficult. This system of ’meritorious action’
(<em>puñña-kiriyā</em>) does not emphasize this level of practice and thus
combines these two factors; moreover, it points out less refined aspects
of concentration and wisdom which can be practised and developed in
everyday life.</p>
<p>Later generations of Buddhist teachers have tended to use this teaching
on meritorious action as appropriate for laypeople. The system of the
threefold training is the standard system and encompasses the entire
Buddhist practice. The bhikkhu sangha, which symbolizes a community
applying the complete model of practice, should act as the leader in
undertaking the system of the threefold training.</p>
<p>Besides dividing benefits or goals (<em>attha</em>) vertically as described
above, the Buddha also classified benefits horizontally, in order of a
person’s responsibilities, or in order of social interactions. Here too
it is a threefold division: {541}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, suppose there is a lake whose water is unmuddied, clear, and
pristine. A person with good eyesight standing on the bank could see
snails, clams, stones, pebbles, and shoals of fish, swimming or
stationary, in that lake. Why is that? Because the water is not
cloudy. Just so, a monk whose mind is unclouded understands his own
benefit (attattha), the benefit of others (parattha), and the benefit
of both (ubhayattha). It is possible for him to realize excellent
states surpassing those of ordinary people, that is, knowledge and
vision (ñāṇa-dassana), which is capable of leading to awakening. Why
is that? Because his mind is unclouded.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 9.</em></p>
<p>When a person is impassioned with lust,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn17-1"><a href="#fn-fn17">17</a></sup> overwhelmed and possessed
by lust … when a person harbours hatred, is overwhelmed and
possessed by hatred … when a person is bewildered through delusion,
overwhelmed and possessed by delusion, then he plans for his own harm,
for the harm of others, and for the harm of both; and he experiences
in his mind suffering and grief. When lust … hatred … delusion has
been abandoned, he neither plans for his own harm, nor for the harm of
others, nor for the harm of both.</p>
<p>When a person is impassioned with lust … harbours hatred … is
bewildered through delusion, he will behave badly by body, speech and
mind. When lust … hatred … delusion has been abandoned, he does
not behave badly by body, speech or mind.</p>
<p>When a person is impassioned with lust … harbours hatred … is
bewildered through delusion, he does not understand as it really is
his own welfare, others’ welfare, or the welfare of both. When lust
… hatred … delusion has been abandoned, he understands as it
really is his own welfare, others’ welfare, and the welfare of both.</p>
<p>Lust, hatred and delusion cause a person to be blind, visionless, and
foolish; they restrict wisdom, cause affliction, and are not conducive
for Nibbāna. Seeing the harm in lust … in hatred … in delusion, I
teach the abandoning of lust … hatred … delusion….</p>
<p>Indeed, this Noble Eightfold Path, that is, right view … right
concentration, is the path, is the way of practice, to abandon lust,
hatred and delusion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn18-1"><a href="#fn-fn18">18</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. I. 216.</em></p>
<p>Monks, considering personal wellbeing, you should accomplish it with
care. Considering others’ wellbeing, you should accomplish it with
care. Considering the wellbeing of both, you should accomplish it with
care. {542}</p>
<p><em>S. II. 29.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Here are definitions for these three kinds of benefits (<em>attha</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn19-1"><a href="#fn-fn19">19</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Attattha</em>: personal benefit; the realization of personal goals,
that is, the three goals (<em>attha</em>) mentioned earlier, which have to
do with oneself, which are accomplishments specific to an
individual. This factor emphasizes self-reliance at every stage of
spiritual practice, so as not to be a burden on others or a
hindrance to the community. Instead, one is fully prepared to help
others and to engage in activities effectively. The mainstay for
realizing this benefit is wisdom. There are many teachings for
achieving this benefit, for example the ’ten virtues which make for
protection’ (<em>nāthakaraṇa-dhamma</em>; ’virtues which make for
self-reliance’). Broadly speaking, this factor refers to bringing
the practice of the threefold training to completion in regard to
personal responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Parattha</em>: the benefit of others; fostering self-reliance in
others; helping others to realize wellbeing or to achieve spiritual
goals, that is, the three goals (<em>attha</em>) mentioned earlier, which
have to do with other people, which are accomplishments of those
apart from oneself. The mainstay for realizing this benefit is
compassion. The teachings promoting this benefit include the Four
Principles of Service (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>) and the teachings on the
responsibilities of a virtuous friend (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ubhayattha</em>: the benefit of both parties or the shared benefit; the
three goals (<em>attha</em>) mentioned earlier, which are realized by both
oneself and others, or by oneself and one’s community, for example
advantages accrued by way of shared belongings or by way of communal
activity. In particular, this benefit refers to a social environment
and way of life that is conducive for all members of a community to
practise in order to realize personal benefits and to act for
others’ benefit. The mainstays for realizing this benefit are moral
discipline (<em>vinaya</em>) and communal harmony (<em>sāmaggī</em>). The
teachings relevant to this subject include the Six Virtues Conducive
to Communal Life (<em>sārāṇīya-dhamma</em>), the Seven Conditions of
Welfare (<em>aparihāniya-dhamma</em>), along with general teachings on
necessary conduct supportive to society.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These two triads of benefits or goals (<em>attha</em>) can thus be combined as
a single group:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Attattha</em>: personal benefit can be divided into three levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>: immediate benefit; basic or visible goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samparāyikattha</em>: future benefit; higher or profound goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paramattha</em>: supreme benefit; highest goal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Parattha</em>: the benefit of others can be divided into the same three
levels:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>: immediate benefit; basic or visible goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samparāyikattha</em>: future benefit; higher or profound goals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paramattha</em>: supreme benefit; highest goal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ubhayattha</em>: the benefit of both oneself and others, or collective
goals; every sort of benefit or objective (according to the three
levels above: immediate, future, and supreme) that is supportive for
developing and realizing personal wellbeing and the wellbeing of
others. {543}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This section pertaining to the various benefits of life is naturally
linked to the previous section on living the holy life. We can thus
recapitulate the meaning of the holy life (<em>brahmacariya</em>), or Buddhist
conduct (<em>cariya</em>), thus: a system of spiritual practice based on an
understanding of natural truths, which is conducive to fulfilling worthy
aspirations of human life, and which fosters both a way of life and a
social environment supportive of realization.</p>
<p>In short, it is a way of life based on truth, leading to worthy goals
and nurturing a healthy environment for realizing these goals.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these three trainings. What three? The training in
higher virtue, the training in higher mind, and the training in higher
wisdom.</p>
<p>And what is the training in higher virtue? Here, a monk in this Dhamma
and Discipline is virtuous, restrained by the restraint of the
Pāṭimokkha, perfect in conduct and resort, seeing danger in the
slightest faults. He undertakes and trains in the various training
rules. This is called the training in higher virtue.</p>
<p>And what is the training in higher mind? Here, secluded from sensual
pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a monk enters and dwells
in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by initial and sustained
thought, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. With the
subsiding of initial and sustained thought he enters and dwells in the
second jhāna, which has internal clarity and unification of mind, is
without initial and sustained thought, and has rapture and happiness
born of concentration. With the fading away as well of rapture, he
dwells equanimous, mindful and clearly comprehending, experiencing
happiness with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of
which the noble ones declare: ’He is equanimous, mindful, one who
dwells happily.’ With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with
the previous passing away of joy and sadness, he enters and dwells in
the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes
the purification of mindfulness by equanimity. This is called the
training in higher mind.</p>
<p>And what is the training in higher wisdom? Here, a monk understands as
it really is: ’This is suffering. This is the origin of suffering.
This is the cessation of suffering. This is the way leading to the
cessation of suffering.’ This is called the training in higher wisdom.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 235-6.</em></p>
<p>Friend Visākha, the three divisions of training principles are not
included in the Noble Eightfold Path, but the Noble Eightfold Path is
included in the three divisions of training principles. Right speech,
right action, and right livelihood – these qualities are included in
the division of virtue (<em>sīla-khandha</em>). Right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration – these qualities are included
in the division of concentration (<em>samādhi-khandha</em>). Right view and
right intention – these qualities are included in the aggregate of
wisdom (<em>paññā-khandha</em>). {544}</p>

<p>The threefold training is considered a complete system of practice,
which encompasses the entirety of the Eightfold Path and distils the
essence of the Path for the purpose of practical application. It is thus
used as the standard teaching for describing Dhamma practice.</p>
<p>It is fair to conclude that the Eightfold Path contains the full essence
of Dhamma practice, and the threefold training expresses the entirety of
Dhamma practice in a practical way. Moreover, the threefold training
draws upon the essential principles contained in the Path and elaborates
upon them, providing comprehensive details of practice.</p>
<p>The Path (<em>magga</em>), or the Noble Eightfold Path
(<em>ariya-aṭṭhaṅgikamagga</em>), can alternatively be translated as the
’Eightfold Path of Noble Beings’, ’Eightfold Path Leading One to Become
a Noble Being’, ’Eightfold Path Discovered by the Noble One (the
Buddha)’, or the ’Supreme Path Comprising Eight Factors’. The eight
factors are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>; right understanding).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right thought (<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right speech (<em>sammā-vācā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right action (<em>sammā-kammanta</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right livelihood (<em>sammā-ājīva</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right effort (<em>sammā-vāyāma</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right mindfulness (<em>sammā-sati</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right concentration (<em>sammā-samādhi</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The term ’eightfold path’ leads some people to misunderstand that there
are eight separate paths which must be travelled in succession: once one
has completed one path one then begins another until all eight are
complete. They think that one must practise these eight factors
separately and in chronological order. But this is not the case.</p>
<p>The term ’eightfold path’ clearly refers to a single path with eight
factors. This is similar to a perfectly built road, which possesses many
different elements and components, for example: layers of earth, stones,
gravel, sand, concrete, and tarmac to build up the road’s surface; the
road’s borders; the lanes; banks where the road curves; light signals;
road signs indicating direction, distance and location; road maps; and
street lamps.</p>
<p>Just as a road is composed of these different parts and someone driving
on it relies on all of them together, so too, the Path comprises
eight factors and a Dhamma practitioner must apply all of them in an
integrated fashion. {545}</p>
<p>For ease of understanding the Buddha classified the eight Path factors
into three groups or ’aggregates’ (<em>khandha</em>; <em>dhamma-khandha</em>). These
are called the morality group (<em>sīla-khandha</em>), the concentration group
(<em>samādhi-khandha</em>), and the wisdom group (<em>paññā-khandha</em>), or simply:
virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>), concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and wisdom
(<em>paññā</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-three-groups">Three Groups</a>)</p>
<p>Here, right speech, right action, and right livelihood are included in
the morality group, just as one may distinguish the compressed earth,
gravel, sand, etc., which make up the road’s surface, as one group.
Right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration are included in
the concentration group, as one may classify the road’s border,
embankments, lanes, and curves – those things regulating the road’s
course and direction – as another group. Finally, right view and right
thought make up the wisdom group, just as one may include traffic
lights, signs, and street lamps into a third group. This is illustrated
as follows:</p>
<div class="figure">

<p><span class="caption">Three Groups</span><a id="note-three-groups"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>See the passage cited above: M. I. 300-301; cf.: A. I. 124-5, 295;
A. III. 15-6; A. V. 326-7; see also the classification of five groups
or aggregates (including those things beyond moral conduct,
concentration and wisdom, making for two more factors: the liberation
aggregate – <em>vimutti-khandha</em> – and the knowledge and vision of
liberation aggregate – <em>vimuttiñāṇadassana-khandha</em>) at: D. III. 279;

<p>This classification of the three groups (the ’three <em>dhamma-khandha</em>’)
– <em>sīla-khandha</em>, <em>samādhi-khandha</em>, and <em>paññā-khandha</em> – is a way of
grouping similar qualities together.</p>
<p>In regard to practical application, these Path factors are classified in
a similar way, and as a group they are given the name the ’threefold
training’ (<em>tisso sikkhā</em>). Individually, they are referred to as the
training in higher virtue (<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>), the training in higher
mind (<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>), and the training in higher wisdom
(<em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>).</p>
<p>Both of these two groups can be referred to simply as
<em>sīla-samādhi-paññā</em>. (Roughly speaking, <em>adhisīla</em> equals <em>sīla</em>,
<em>adhicitta</em> equals <em>samādhi</em>, and <em>adhipaññā</em> equals <em>paññā</em>.)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn20-1"><a href="#fn-fn20">20</a></sup>
These trainings can be illustrated as follows: {546}</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./includes/images/diagrams/three-trainings.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Whereas the classification of the three aggregates simply groups
together similar qualities, the threefold training aims to show the
sequence of how these qualities are applied in practice.</p>
<p>The word <em>sikkhā</em> can be translated as ’training’, ’study’,
’discipline’, ’paying careful attention to’, ’practice’, or
’cultivation’. (See
Note <a href="#note-generating">Generating and Developing</a>) This term refers to the essential aspects
of training and cultivating one’s physical conduct, speech, state of
mind, and wisdom, leading gradually to the realization of the highest
goal, to liberation: Nibbāna.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Generating and Developing</span><a id="note-generating"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A very similar Pali word to <em>sikkhā</em> is <em>bhāvanā</em>, which is translated
as: ’generating’, ’developing’, ’cultivation’, ’growth’, or
’practice’.</p>
<p>Occasionally, one finds a similar threefold division of <em>bhāvanā</em>:
development of the body (<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>), development of mind
(<em>citta-bhāvanā</em>), and development of wisdom (<em>paññā-bhāvanā</em>) – see
D. III. 219-20. The commentaries, however, say that this passage
refers to physical, mental and wisdom development completed by
arahants (DA. III. 1003). Normally, the completed development of
arahants is divided into four factors, with the development of virtue
(<em>sīla-bhāvanā</em>) constituting the second one, and in this context the
term <em>bhāvita</em> is most often used: <em>bhāvita-kāya</em>, <em>bhāvita-sīla</em>,
<em>bhāvita-citta</em>, and <em>bhāvita-paññā</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Brief definitions for the three trainings are as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn21-1"><a href="#fn-fn21">21</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Training in higher virtue (<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn22-1"><a href="#fn-fn22">22</a></sup> training and
study on the level of conduct and in line with a moral code, in
order to be upright in body, speech, and livelihood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training in higher mind (<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn23-1"><a href="#fn-fn23">23</a></sup> training the
mind, cultivating spiritual qualities, generating happiness,
developing the state of one’s mind, and gaining proficiency at
concentration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training in higher wisdom (<em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>): training in higher
levels of wisdom, giving rise to thorough understanding, which leads
to complete purification of the mind and liberation from suffering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to give a complete definition of these three trainings one must
combine an explanation of their purpose. The threefold training refers
to the training of conduct, the mind, and wisdom, which leads to an end
of suffering and to true happiness and deliverance. The essence of each
training in the context of this path of liberation is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The essence of training in higher morality is to live in an upright
way in society, supporting, protecting, and promoting a peaceful and
virtuous coexistence. Moral conduct is a foundation for developing
the quality of one’s mind and cultivating wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The essence of training in higher mind is to develop and enhance the
quality and potential of the mind, which supports living a virtuous
life and is conducive for applying wisdom in the most optimal way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The essence of training in higher wisdom is to discern and
understand things according to the truth, to penetrate the nature of
conditioned phenomena, so that one lives and acts with wisdom. One
knows how to relate to the world correctly and shares blessings with
others, endowed with a bright, independent, and joyous mind, free
from suffering.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The essence of the threefold training is not confined to an individual,
but also has a bearing on or appeals to people’s responsibilities in the
context of their communities and society: to establishing social
systems, building institutions, arranging activities, and applying
various methods in order for the essence of these trainings to be
integrated in society, or for people to be grounded in the threefold
training. (Here, a moral code acts as a basis for these social systems,
which then links to the training in higher morality.) {547}</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, when the term <em>sīla</em> encompasses a moral code or
discipline, the meaning of <em>sīla</em> includes creating an environment, both
physical and social, which helps to prevent evil, unskilful actions and
promotes virtuous actions. This is especially true in relation to
setting up social systems and social enterprises, by establishing
communities, organizations, or institutions, and by enacting a moral
code and prescribing rules and regulations, for regulating the behaviour
of people and promoting communal wellbeing. The technical word for such
a moral code is <em>vinaya</em>.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, setting down a moral code (<em>vinaya</em>) is a preparation
or an instrument for establishing people in virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>);
technically, <em>vinaya</em> has not yet reached the stage of <em>sīla</em>. But as
mentioned above, in relation to spiritual training, moral discipline is
connected to and is a foundation for moral conduct. So, when speaking
comprehensively, <em>vinaya</em> is included in the term <em>sīla</em>.</p>
<p>A moral code should be prescribed appropriate to the objectives of a
particular community or society. For example, the monastic discipline
(Vinaya) that the Buddha laid down for both the bhikkhu and bhikkhuni
communities contains both precepts dealing with monks’ and nuns’
individual behaviour, and those dealing with communal issues:
administration, looking into and considering legal issues, imposing
penalties, appointing sangha officials, procedures for sangha meetings,
proper decorum for both receiving visitors and for being a guest
oneself, and the use of communal possessions.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn24-1"><a href="#fn-fn24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>In the context of the wider society the Buddha suggested broad
principles to be used by leaders and rulers, who should determine the
details of behaviour in relation to their state or nation. An example is
the teaching on the ’imperial observances’ (<em>cakkavatti-vatta</em>), which
presents principles for a king or emperor to rule in a righteous fashion
favourable to all members of the population, to prevent lawlessness,
immorality and evil in the country, and to distribute wealth so that
none of the citizens are left destitute.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn25-1"><a href="#fn-fn25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>In contemporary parlance a disciplinary code (<em>vinaya</em>) fostering
virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>) in society as a whole encompasses many
aspects, including: the government, legislature, and judiciary; the
economy, cultural traditions, social institutions; and other important
aspects, like the policy around adult entertainment centres, places of
ill-repute, addictive substances, crime, and professional standards.</p>
<p>Essentially, ’higher mind’ (<em>adhicitta</em>) or concentration refers to
methods of developing tranquillity (<em>samatha</em>) and to various methods of
(tranquillity) meditation, which many teachers and meditation centres
have designed and established in the evolution of Buddhism, as is
evident in the meditation systems described in the commentaries,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn26-1"><a href="#fn-fn26">26</a></sup>
which have been adapted over the ages. But in a general, comprehensive
sense, higher mind or concentration encompasses all the methods and
means to induce calm in people’s minds, to make people be steadfast in
virtue, and to rouse enthusiasm and generate perseverance in developing
goodness. {548}</p>
<p>From a broad perspective, similar to including <em>vinaya</em> in the term
<em>sīla</em>, the training in higher mind includes a system of establishing
virtuous friends (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>), of providing for the seven favourable
conditions (<em>sappāya</em>, see
Note <a href="#note-favourable-conditions">Favourable Conditions</a>), and of enhancing the quality
of the mind so that people progress in meditation and in mind
development. This includes such things as: establishing places that are
relaxing and refreshing; creating a cheerful, bright atmosphere in
people’s living spaces, offices, and worksites; educating people to
think in positive ways; instilling in people’s minds the qualities of
lovingkindness and compassion, the desire to do good, and a wish for
spiritual refinement; organizing activities that help generate virtue;
encouraging people to adopt a spiritual ideal; and teaching people to
strengthen the mind and increase its capability.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Favourable Conditions</span><a id="note-favourable-conditions"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <em>sappāya</em> (conditions that make for a sense of ease; suitable,
supportive, and favourable factors; conditions favourable to
meditation; conditions which strengthen and support concentration)
appear in separate passages in the Tipiṭaka. The commentaries compile
these factors into seven:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>dwelling (<em>āvāsa</em>/<em>senāsana</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>resort; place for finding food (<em>gocara</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>speech; listening to teachings (<em>bhassa</em>/<em>dhammassavana</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>persons (<em>puggala</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>food (<em>bhojana</em>/<em>āhāra</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>climate, environment (<em>utu</em>); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>posture (<em>iriyāpatha</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If these factors are unsuitable and unfavourable they are referred to
as <em>asappāya</em>.</p>
<p><em>See: Vism. 127; VinA. II. 429; MA. IV. 161.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In a strict, literal sense, ’higher wisdom’ (<em>adhipaññā</em>) refers to the
development of insight (<em>vipassanā-bhāvanā</em>), for which the systems of
practice have evolved in a similar way to methods of practising
concentration. But from a wider perspective, which takes into account
the essence and objective of wisdom, this level of practice refers to
all activities of developing one’s thinking and knowing, encompassing
the entire spectrum of what is called ’study’ or ’training’. Such study
relies on virtuous friends, especially one’s teachers, to transmit
’learning’ (<em>suta</em>; knowledge) and proficiency in the arts and sciences,
beginning with vocational knowledge (which is a matter of virtuous
conduct – <em>sīla</em>).</p>
<p>Vocational or academic knowledge in itself, however, does not qualify as
<em>adhipaññā</em>. Teachers should establish faith in their students and
encourage them to think for themselves; at the very least the students
should develop right view in line with Dhamma. Over and above this,
teachers can help students to see things according to the truth and to
relate to the world correctly, to live wisely, to develop an effective
practice that subdues defilements and dispels suffering, to benefit
others, and to be happy.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, providing a training on this level is the function
of schools or institutes of learning. Such places should support a
training on all three levels: virtuous conduct, concentration, and
wisdom; they should not focus exclusively on wisdom. This is because the
training in higher wisdom is the highest stage of training, the
completion of which relies on the first two stages as a foundation.
Moreover, these three levels of training are mutually supportive. Only
when these three stages of development are well-integrated is spiritual
practice true and complete.</p>
<p>In everyday circumstances, the gradual and interrelated practice
according to the threefold training is easy to illustrate. For example:
when people live together peacefully they do not need to experience
mistrust or fear; when one does not perform bad deeds the heart is at
ease; when the heart is at ease one is able to reflect on and understand
things effectively. When one does not perform bad deeds one is
self-confident and the mind is settled; when the mind is settled one is
able to contemplate things earnestly and directly. When one performs
good deeds, say by helping someone else, the mind is joyful and clear;
when the mind is clear one’s thinking too is clear and agile. When there
are no issues of enmity and revenge between people, the mind is not
overcast or in conflict; when the mind is not clouded or bad-tempered
one contemplates things clearly, without bias and distortion. From such
well-prepared foundations a person is able to develop more refined
levels of spiritual practice. {549}</p>
<h3 id="householders-cultivate-the-path-by-developing-meritorious-actions"><a class="header" href="#householders-cultivate-the-path-by-developing-meritorious-actions">Householders Cultivate the Path by Developing Meritorious Actions</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, when teaching the Dhamma in a suitable way for
laypeople or householders, rather than apply the system of the Path in
the form of the threefold training – <em>sīla</em>, <em>samādhi</em> and <em>paññā</em> –
the Buddha reformatted the practice, as if establishing a simpler form
of training. Here, he set down a new sequence of basic principles
referred to as ’meritorious action’ (<em>puñña-kiriyā</em>) or the ’bases of
meritorious action’ (<em>puññakiriyā-vatthu</em>). In this teaching, there are
likewise three factors, but with different names: generosity (<em>dāna</em>),
virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>), and mental cultivation (<em>bhāvanā</em>).</p>
<p>It is useful to understand that, similar to the threefold training, the
teachings on meritorious action are also a form of study and training.
Indeed, the essence of meritorious action is spiritual training.</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these three grounds for meritorious action: … the
ground for meritorious action consisting of generosity, the ground for
meritorious action consisting of virtue, and the ground for
meritorious action consisting of cultivation.</p>
<p>[One who desires the good] should train in acts of merit, which have
far-reaching effects and end in bliss.</p>
<p>Let him practise generosity, righteous behaviour (samacariyā),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn27-1"><a href="#fn-fn27">27</a></sup>
and a heart of lovingkindness.</p>
<p>A wise person who cultivates these three qualities leading to
happiness,</p>
<p>Attains a world of joy, free from misery.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn28-1"><a href="#fn-fn28">28</a></sup></p>
<p><em>It. 51-52.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In this passage, after the Buddha mentions the three bases of
meritorious action, he concludes by describing what one should do in
regard to them, that is, ’one should train in acts of merit.’ Here, the
Pali states: <em>puññameva so sikkheyya</em>. Combining these two terms results
in the compound <em>puñña sikkhā</em>: ’training in merit’.</p>
<p>Training here refers to generating, developing, and becoming proficient
in spiritual qualities, i.e. to advance on the Path in a way consistent
with the teaching on the threefold training. Applying the threefold
training as a standard, one can compare these teachings as shown on
Figure <a href="#fig-applying-training">Applying the Threefold Training</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">Applying the Threefold Training</span><a id="fig-applying-training"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/applying-training.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>As mentioned above, the teaching on meritorious actions for householders
emphasizes a person’s external environment and elementary forms of
spiritual practice. This is in contrast to the teachings aimed at the
monastic sangha which emphasize a person’s inner life and higher levels
of practice.</p>
<p>In the threefold training the beginning stages of practice are
incorporated in the term <em>sīla</em>. The teaching on meritorious actions,
however, stresses the way a person deals with material belongings and
engages with society, and therefore the beginning stages are divided
into two factors, with the management of material things – by way of
generosity – reinforcing the second factor of virtuous conduct. For
monks and nuns, the teaching begins with virtuous conduct; for
householders it begins with generosity and virtue.</p>
<p>In other words, because monks and nuns do not have much to do with
material things, generosity (<em>dāna</em>; ’giving’) plays a minor role. For
this reason in the threefold training generosity is appended to or
concealed within the factor of virtuous conduct. (On the allocation of
material things in the monastic sangha look at the Vinaya.)</p>
<p>In regard to profound, internal factors the threefold training contains
the two stages of concentration and wisdom. The monastic life is devoted
to spiritual development, to the cultivation of higher mind
(<em>adhicitta</em>) and higher wisdom (<em>adhipaññā</em>). The threefold training
thus clearly separates spiritual training into these two factors. In
contrast, the teaching on meritorious actions contains the single term
’cultivation’ (<em>bhāvanā</em>), and according to the passage above the focus
here is on the practice of lovingkindness. {550}</p>
<p>The life of householders is directly involved with material possessions,
and the search for and management of these possessions takes place in
relation to society. If people do not manage their possessions well,
they lose them, and both individuals and society is troubled. For this
reason it is necessary to highlight the two factors of generosity and
virtuous conduct, as two distinct meritorious actions. Although
internal, spiritual practice is important, it needs to be managed in a
way appropriate to people’s capabilities and available time and energy.
Here, the two factors of mind training and wisdom development are
combined in the single factor of ’cultivation’ (<em>bhāvanā</em>). And because
the distinctive feature of the householder life is an interaction with
the wider society, cultivation here focuses primarily on the practice of
lovingkindness.</p>
<p>To conform to the teaching above, rather than use the common expression
’make merit’, it would be more accurate to say that Buddhists are
encouraged to ’train in merit’. <em>Puñña</em> refers to a person’s superior
qualities and abilities – physical, verbal, mental, and spiritual. We
are encouraged to increase and refine our merits though the training in
body, speech, mind, and wisdom. This is a form of self-development; our
lives will then gradually become more refined and prosperous.</p>
<p>The three bases of meritorious action are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dāna</em>: giving; generosity; liberality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em>: upright behaviour; a healthy, supportive interaction with
other people, free from exploitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhāvanā</em>: the cultivation of the mind and of wisdom.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the ancient times venerable elders taught and transmitted this
teaching on meritorious action to newer generations. By the time the
commentaries were written an additional seven factors had been added.
These additional factors are indeed elaborations on the original three:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dāna</em>: an additional two factors are added: <em>pattidāna</em>: offering
the chance to others to share one’s merit by doing good deeds
together; and <em>pattānumodanā</em>: rejoicing in the merit of others, by
delighting in and supporting their good actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em>: two factors are added: <em>apacāyana</em>: to be obliging,
courteous, humble, and respectful; to honour one’s elders and
virtuous people; to have good manners as conforms to one’s culture
and tradition; and <em>veyyāvacca</em>: to help, serve, and support others;
to endeavour in beneficial activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhāvanā</em>: two factors are added: <em>dhamma-savana</em>: to listen to
Dhamma teachings, which also includes reading useful texts; and
<em>dhamma-desanā</em>: to teach the Dhamma to others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Special factor: <em>diṭṭhuju-kamma</em>: to make one’s views upright. This
factor must accompany all the other factors so that one’s actions
are performed with correct understanding and right intention. This
is equivalent to inspecting each activity and it guarantees true
progress and good results.</li>
</ul>
<p>The addition of these extra factors comprises the ten bases of
meritorious action:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dāna-maya</em>: merit by way of giving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla-maya</em>: merit by way of upholding moral principles and acting
virtuously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhāvanā-maya</em>: merit by way of cultivation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Apacāyana-maya</em>: merit by way of respectful behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Veyyāvacca-maya</em>: merit by way of serving others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pattidāna-maya</em>: merit by way of sharing one’s goodness with
others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pattānumodanā-maya</em>: merit by way of rejoicing in the goodness of
others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dhamma-savana-maya</em>: merit by way of listening to the Dhamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dhamma-desanā-maya</em>: merit by way of teaching the Dhamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhuju-kamma</em>: merit by way of making one’s views upright. {551}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-eightfold-path-and-a-system-of-training"><a class="header" href="#the-eightfold-path-and-a-system-of-training">The Eightfold Path and a System of Training</a></h3>
<p>The question arises why the factors in the Path and the same factors in
the threefold training are presented in a different order. The Eightfold
Path begins with right view and right thought, and concludes with right
concentration. Why does the teaching on the threefold training begin
with right speech, which belongs to the group pertaining to virtuous
conduct, and end with right view and right thought, which belong to the
group on wisdom?</p>
<p>Before answering this question, let us review the link between cessation
(<em>nirodha</em>) and the Path. The Path arises as a consequence of people
applying natural laws to benefit their lives. The Path is a way of
practice established in order to produce results in harmony with a
natural process.</p>
<p>The Path is the starting point of applying one’s understanding of nature
and creating a method of practice. It is the bridge between nature and
practical methods used by people to suit specific circumstances. The
Path is the key principle of spiritual practice.</p>
<p>As a complementary teaching, the threefold training takes the essence of
the Path and creates a systematic course of practice, by adapting and
organizing the eight Path factors. The details and emphasis of this
teaching varies according to the objective of specific situations or
levels of practice, which results in a different sequence of factors
from that outlined in the Eightfold Path.</p>
<p>As the Path is the key principle of spiritual practice, it focuses on
the essential ingredients of practice. On its own the Eightfold Path
simply lists these essential factors. This is similar to presenting a
list of tools which are required to accomplish a task or to examining a
road and analyzing its components – at this stage one does not yet
state how these various things are going to be used.</p>
<p>In the Eightfold Path, the eight factors, functioning within an
individual Dhamma practitioner, are ordered according to their
relationship to one another. Here, right view is listed as the first
factor and the starting point, because if one lacks this single factor
none of the other factors can arise.</p>
<p>This is similar to making a journey – one must know which path to take.
At the very least, one needs to know where to begin, for without this
knowledge the journey cannot take place. Spiritual practice is the same.
To begin with, one requires an understanding, or at least a proper
confidence, of the path of practice to be undertaken. From this point
one is then able to reflect and act accordingly. Practice relies on a
foundation of understanding, which is similar to a person’s starting
capital. When right view clears the way or breaks the ground, the
subsequent Path factors arise as a consequence.</p>
<p>One’s views, beliefs, understanding and attitudes shape the way one
thinks and reflects. When one thinks correctly and in a forward-looking
way, one develops a clearer understanding. Thoughts shape one’s speech;
when one reflects well and clearly, one speaks clearly. Likewise, the
nature and extent of one’s reflections shape the nature and extent of
one’s actions. When one is able to reflect on things well and to discuss
or share these thoughts with others, this directs and influences one’s
actions. In turn, the sphere or range of one’s thoughts, speech, and
actions shape how one earns a livelihood. {552}</p>
<p>Speech, actions, and ways of earning a living all require effort. In
order for one’s effort to be successful one must apply regular and
persistent mindfulness. With the guidance of mindfulness the mind
becomes one-pointed and stable.</p>
<p>If one begins with correct, wholesome understanding, beliefs, and views,
i.e. one is endowed with right view, one’s thoughts, speech, actions,
etc. will unfold accordingly; they too will be <em>sammā</em>: correct,
complete, and true. As one gradually develops these eight factors one’s
spiritual practice deepens. (See
Note <a href="#note-factors-friends">The Path Factors as Friends Working Together</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">The Path Factors as Friends Working Together</span><a id="note-factors-friends"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>See the commentarial analysis on the relationship of the Path factors
at: VbhA. 114-17. See also the analogies at VbhA. 91 and Vism. 514-15,
explaining the reason for classifying the Path factors into different
groups.</p>
<p>One simile is of three friends who help each other to collect
<em>champaka</em> flowers, which are out of reach of a single person standing
up.</p>
<p><em>Right effort</em> is like one of them who bends over and allows a second
friend, i.e. <em>right concentration</em>, to climb on his back, extending
his reach. <em>Right mindfulness</em> is like a third friend who stands
nearby and offers his shoulders to support the second person and to
keep him from staggering.</p>
<p>The second friend, who stands alone on the back of the first, still
sways back and forth, so he cannot collect the flowers; when he
supports himself at the shoulder of the third friend, he remains
stable and straight, enabling him to complete the task as desired.</p>
<p>A simile for <em>right thought</em> is that it is like fingers, which turn a
coin over in the hand, enabling the ’treasurer’, i.e. <em>right view</em>, to
determine whether the coin is counterfeit or genuine.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <em>right thought</em> is like a person who rolls a log over,
enabling a lumberjack, i.e. <em>right view</em>, to chop the log as wished.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The threefold training focuses on practical application, organizing the
Path factors into various stages of spiritual practice in order for
these factors to bear fruit in a systematic way. In a similar fashion,
after listing the set of tools at hand and knowing each one’s function,
one then determines the order in which these tools are to be used; one
specifies how each tool is to be used at different stages of work.</p>
<p>The threefold training shifts the focus from the mutual relationship of
the Path factors within an individual to a person’s relationship to his
or her environment or society. It shifts the emphasis from a person’s
internal spiritual life to the external circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, instead of emphasizing how right view leads to right
thought, and subsequently to right speech and right action, here the
teachings focus outwards, to what exactly are the details of right
speech and right action, and to how one should speak and act with
members of one’s community. It determines the nature of one’s outward
behaviour, which has an effect and influence on one’s thoughts and
reflections. For example, it sets down a set of guidelines and
regulations for training, for living one’s life, and for practice, in
order that people develop self-restraint and are able to discern by
themselves what is suitable behaviour and conduct. Although the
threefold training begins by focusing on people’s relationship to their
society and environment, it circles back to the individual’s internal
spiritual life. And it is this point that highlights the true meaning of
<em>sikkhā</em>, as ’training’, ’study’, ’development’.</p>
<p>In this sense, right speech, right action and right livelihood are
matters of moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>). The training, development and growth
of right speech, right action and right livelihood (as conducive to
solving problems and making an end of suffering) is referred to as
training in higher virtue (<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>).</p>
<p>Right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration comprise the
group of mental collectedness (<em>samādhi</em>). The training and development
of these three factors (as conducive to the end of suffering) is
referred to as training in higher mind (<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>).</p>
<p>Right view and right thought make up the group of wisdom. The
development of these two factors (as conducive to the end of suffering)
is referred to as training in higher wisdom (<em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>).</p>
<p>The threefold training changes the focus from the mutual relationship of
the factors described in the Eightfold Path to the gradual training of
an individual. Moreover, it begins with common or basic spiritual
qualities and moves to more refined ones, from those aspects of
spiritual practice that are easy to see to profound qualities that are
difficult to define and manage. It begins with the training of body and
speech, and then focuses on the training of the mind and of wisdom.
{553}</p>
<p>In other words, the threefold training shifts from the interrelated
functioning of the Path factors at every moment in an individual to
longer intervals of time in the process of training, which is divided
into different stages, according to the prominent role of specific
factors at each particular stage. This training begins with basic moral
conduct, which emphasizes external behaviour of body and speech. It then
moves on to the refined level of concentration – to the development of
the mind – in order to support and develop wisdom, so that wisdom can
be used most effectively.</p>
<p>The threefold training is thus a complete system of practice, presented
as a way to train people in the context of their everyday lives, by
recognizing that people live in a social environment. It is organized
into stages, which comprise longer intervals of time and are ordered
according to those spiritual factors which require special attention at
each particular stage.</p>
<p>It is important to note here that, regardless of which stage a
practitioner is training in – whether it be moral conduct,
concentration or wisdom – each and every Path factor – from right view
to right concentration – is operating and functional during all times
of the process. To state that one is training at the level of moral
conduct, concentration, or wisdom is simply a way to announce that at
this time one is giving special emphasis and importance to developing
specific factors or a group of factors, or that at this time specific
factors have been summoned to play a salient role.</p>
<p>From one perspective it appears that there are two systems of practice:
an external training and an internal training.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn29-1"><a href="#fn-fn29">29</a></sup> These two systems
are connected, and the validity of both is acknowledged in the Buddhist
teachings.</p>
<p>The relationship between the levels of practice outlined in the
threefold training and the function of the factors in the Eightfold Path
can be described by using the following analogy:</p>
<p>A man is driving a car on a long journey. He begins in a distant, flat
landscape, passes through a labyrinthine mountain range, and ends in the
middle of a large, congested city.</p>
<p>The journey can be divided into three stages: first is a long stretch in
the countryside, where the road is flat; the middle stage is in the
mountains, winding around the hillsides and passing precipitous,
dangerous ravines; the final stage is in the city, which contains
numerous roads and alleys, crowded buildings, and bustling people, a
place where someone not highly skilled would have great difficulty
finding his destination.</p>
<p>This man has never driven a car before, and begins his apprenticeship by
undertaking this journey. He hopes that by the time he reaches his goal
he will have become an expert driver.</p>
<p>During the first leg of the journey the man must become skilled at using
his hands and feet and become familiar with the mechanics and
instruments of the car. Moreover, he must be careful to avoid parts of
the road that are too soft or contain potholes. The main focus of his
work is simply to apply a normal sense of caution, to ensure that the
car makes progress. If the road is flat and he has become skilled at the
basic mechanics of driving, the car should function with ease.</p>
<p>During the second leg the man must use a lot of strength and caution,
guiding the car around the sharp bends and along the steep ravines,
slowing down or speeding up depending on whether he is driving up or
down hills, and keeping the car steady. The main task at this stage is
strength, control, constant vigilance and awareness, and concentration.
{554}</p>
<p>One may ask whether he no longer needs to pay attention to the car’s
engine and equipment, or to avoid potholes and places where the road is
soft. The answer is that he must still pay careful attention to these
things; indeed, he must be even more careful than before. But at this
stage it is not necessary to mention these things, because if he is not
yet skilled in regard to the car’s mechanics or if the road is
completely broken up and uneven, he will be out of control and may have
to abandon the trip entirely.</p>
<p>Those things he should now give special attention to are the road’s
shoulders, lanes, curves, inclines and slopes. The success of this
second stage of the journey may also depend on other factors. For
example, when he reaches these mountains he may become fearful and
fainthearted, and stop or turn around; he may venture forwards but drive
off a cliff (similar to someone who goes insane while practising
meditation or whose practice deviates from the true path); or he may
become enchanted by the scenery and park his car (like someone who is
captivated by the attainments of jhāna).</p>
<p>In the third leg of the journey there is a dazzling number of streets,
alleys, and crossroads, billboards, posters and road signs, traffic
signals, buildings, vehicles and pedestrians. The driver must have a
keen eye, understand the different signs and traffic signals, be able to
read the information about different landmarks, know where to turn, and
be able to make decisions quickly and accurately. The main task at this
stage is to not get lost.</p>
<p>The first stage in the open countryside, requiring caution in regard to
ordinary forward movement, is similar to virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>). The
second stage in the mountains, emphasizing strength, control, awareness,
and stability, is similar to concentration (<em>samādhi</em>). The third stage
in the city, requiring quick wit and not getting lost, is similar to
wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).</p>
<p>It is evident that, although each stage emphasizes different mental
qualities, the road itself contains similar attributes throughout.</p>
<p>This analogy provides a broad overview. In real-life practice these
different factors are continually being developed, as subsidiary,
repeating stages in a larger process. This is similar to a long motorway
which contains a series of alternating flat, steep, and intricate
sections.</p>
<p>This is confirmation of the link between the threefold training, which
emphasizes external practice, and the Eightfold Path, which highlights
the function of internal spiritual factors. When one trains in moral
conduct, the mind becomes concentrated; when the mind is concentrated
one reflects with wisdom. Wisdom is equivalent to right view, the first
factor of the Path. Right view results in right thought, which in turn
leads to right speech, right action, and right livelihood, in accord
with the interrelationship of the Path factors. Right view thus
generates and fosters moral conduct, which then leads to the ensuing
Path factors. Moreover, right view enhances the quality of spiritual
training and both strengthens and refines all the other Path
factors.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn30-1"><a href="#fn-fn30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>From a preliminary perspective this cycle of the threefold training is
similar to three distinct ways of practice functioning in parallel at
all times. An example of this is a description in the Visuddhimagga of
the meditation on breathing (<em>ānāpānasati</em>), which in a nutshell is as
follows: to be vigilant and to check that one’s behaviour is the most
suitable and effective for this activity is the training in higher
morality (<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>); to make the mind steadfast and stable
(i.e. to remain with the activity or object of attention) is the
training in higher concentration (<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>); to apply wisdom
or the knowledge arising during this activity is the training in higher
wisdom (<em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn31-1"><a href="#fn-fn31">31</a></sup> {555}</p>
<p>The threefold training is a teaching frequently presented by the Buddha
(<em>bahula-dhammīkathā</em>). The following passage describes the sequential
nature of this training:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom. Concentration
which has been ripened by morality brings great fruit and blessings.
Wisdom which has been ripened by concentration brings great fruit and
blessings. The mind which has been ripened by wisdom becomes
completely free from the taints, that is, from the taint of
sensuality, from the taint of becoming, and from the taint of
ignorance.</p>
<p><em>D. II. 123.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The interrelationship between <em>sīla</em>, <em>samādhi</em> and <em>paññā</em> is visible
in everyday life. When one conducts oneself purely, is confident of
one’s moral purity, does not fear punishment or being harmed by one’s
adversaries, is not anxious about criticism or being ostracized, and is
not agitated out of a sense of self-loathing over one’s bad deeds, the
mind is peaceful and one remains focused on one’s thoughts, speech, and
actions. The more peaceful and concentrated is one’s mind, the clearer
is one’s thinking process and the quicker and more agile is one’s
understanding.</p>
<p>This is similar to water which has not been stirred or shaken; the
surface is calm, the sediment settles on the bottom, and the water is
clear, enabling a person to see things clearly. At higher levels of
Dhamma practice, which give rise to higher knowledge and eliminate
mental defilement, it is even more important for the mind to be tranquil
and clear and to possess one-pointed concentration, which is able to
suspend cognition by way of the sense doors and sustain attention solely
at the chosen object of awareness, in order to completely eliminate
mental ’sediment’.</p>
<p>The Buddha occasionally presented the threefold training as a simple
format for spiritual practice, and these teachings are often referred to
by later generations of Buddhists. For example, the threefold training
is an important component of the key teaching known as the Ovāda
Pāṭimokkha, of which one verse contains three clauses:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn32-1"><a href="#fn-fn32">32</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṁ</em>: to refrain from all evil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kusalassūpasampadā</em>: to cultivate what is wholesome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sacittapariyodapanaṁ</em>: to purify the mind.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to emphasize the importance of right view or of the
wisdom factors: all Buddhist systems of practice, whether they
correspond with the Eightfold Path or with the threefold training, begin
and end with wisdom. {556}</p>
<p>Although the threefold training begins with moral conduct, this conduct
relies as a starting capital on an understanding of those things which
one is about to practise, that is, it relies on right view. But because
this basic form of understanding involves simply knowing in which
direction to proceed and where to begin, it is not included as a
separate stage in the broad teaching of the threefold training.</p>
<p>When a practitioner possesses a fundamental understanding or a correct
set of beliefs, he or she begins the training in moral conduct: in
physical actions, speech, and livelihood. When upright moral conduct is
accomplished, a person trains at more refined levels, by developing the
mind (<em>samādhi</em>) and finally by developing wisdom to the point of
liberation from ignorance.</p>
<p>Wisdom is in fact cultivated continuously, throughout the process of
spiritual training. At the beginning the understanding referred to as
right view may simply be a belief in accord with reasoned analysis. In
later stages of practice one’s original understanding or beliefs will
gradually develop and become more clear by means of proper reflection,
contemplation, and investigation, and by witnessing the fruits of one’s
practice and the increased strength of the spiritual faculties, until
wisdom reaches the stage of understanding all things according to the
truth, of liberation, and of realizing Nibbāna. Reasoned understanding
or rational belief becomes a true and complete knowing inherent in the
mind:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>This middle way of practice gives rise to understanding
(<em>ñāṇa-karaṇī</em>), gives rise to vision (<em>cakkhu-karaṇī</em>), and leads to
peace, to awakening, to Nibbāna.</p>
<p><em>Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Vin. I. 10; S. V. 421.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Path culminates in wisdom, which plays a key role in the realization
of the goal. For this reason there are passages in the scriptures in
which two more factors are added to the end of the Eightfold Path: right
knowledge (<em>sammā-ñāṇa</em>; corresponding to <em>ñāṇa-karaṇī</em> and
<em>cakkhu-karaṇī</em>), and right liberation (<em>sammā-vimutti</em>; corresponding
to ’peace, awakening, Nibbāna’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn33-1"><a href="#fn-fn33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>Right view is thus similar to a bridge, leading from ignorance
(<em>avijjā</em>) to true knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>). When one possesses true
knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>), ’right knowledge’ (<em>sammā-ñāṇa</em>) arises and one
achieves right liberation.</p>
<p>Note that the three factors of right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>), right effort
(<em>sammā-vāyāma</em>), and right mindfulness (<em>sammā-sati</em>) play a special
role because they are constantly present in combination with the other
Path factors.</p>
<p>Their important participatory role can be explained by using the analogy
of making a journey. Right view is like a lamp or a compass, which
allows one to see the path ahead and to be confident that one is
travelling in the right direction leading to the goal. Right effort is
like applying energy to advance, or to using strength to propel oneself
forward. Right mindfulness is like an instrument which controls, guides
and guards one’s movements, so that one remains on the path, travels at
the proper pace, and avoids danger.</p>
<p>All levels of practice, whether it be of moral conduct, concentration,
or wisdom, thus rely on these three Path factors.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn34-1"><a href="#fn-fn34">34</a></sup> {557}</p>
<h3 id="beginning-and-end-of-the-path"><a class="header" href="#beginning-and-end-of-the-path">Beginning and End of the Path</a></h3>
<p><em>Sammā-diṭṭhi</em> is translated as right view or correct view. On a mundane
level this refers to seeing things in accord with the teachings on truth
(Dhamma). On a transcendent level this refers to seeing things directly
in accord with truth: according to reality or to the law of
conditionality.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn35-1"><a href="#fn-fn35">35</a></sup> Seeing things, or even believing in things, in
accord with Dhamma teachings, for example believing that by doing good
one will receive good and by doing evil one will receive evil, is enough
to begin Dhamma practice. By having such views and beliefs one is ready
for practice and one begins the first stage of training, in virtuous
conduct.</p>
<p>A person who possesses only this level of right view, however, tends to
give great emphasis to the practice of morality and often does not
advance to the stages of concentration and wisdom. In the scriptures
mundane right view is often presented in the teachings on righteous
conduct (<em>dhamma-cariyā</em>) and the ten wholesome courses of action
(<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>), which are ways of practising the Eightfold Path
on an ordinary, everyday level.</p>
<p>The teaching on the Four Noble Truths presents a somewhat broader
definition of <em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>. Although it does not refer specifically to
right view, it corresponds with the practice of the Eightfold Path in
its entirety. A basic understanding of the Four Noble Truths – of the
nature of human problems, of the causes to these problems, of the goal,
and of the way of practice – is a foundation for commencing Dhamma
practice. This is similar to the knowledge mentioned earlier: to know
where one is going, to know which path will lead one to this end, and to
know where this path begins.</p>
<p>The most comprehensive definition of right view is knowledge of the
truth: to see things as they truly are and to see how things exist
according to causes and conditions. This definition encompasses all the
previous definitions, including to see the nature of human problems, to
see the conditions giving rise to these problems, and to see the nature
of the Path. This definition highlights the clear development of right
view or understanding along the entire stretch of the Path. The more one
practises the more one knows, until one completes the practice and knows
all that is essential to know.</p>
<p>Right view is thus the starting point or the leading factor for practice
along the Middle Way; it is the principal Path factor, playing a role at
all stages of spiritual practice.</p>
<p>In the development of the Path, however, right view is not only a
prerequisite or support for other Path factors; right view itself is
supported by the other factors. The further one progresses on the Path
the more right view is nourished, strengthened, and purified. Finally,
right view becomes the key agent leading to the goal of the Path, and
thus it is possible to say that right view is both the beginning and the
end of the Path.</p>
<p>The fact that right view gradually unfolds and deepens during the course
of the Path reveals that the quality of right view varies during
different stages of practice. The quality of right view at the start of
the Path differs from that of right view at the culmination of the Path.
{558}</p>
<p>Right view at different stages of the Path may have specific attributes
which are distinct from general definitions of right view. Right view at
the beginning of the Path is incomplete and may not correspond to the
full definition of <em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>. Similarly, right view at the end of
the Path has unique attributes so that it should be referred to by
another word. In these circumstances it is useful to distinguish
different Pali terms.</p>
<p>Because right view is an aspect of wisdom, an appropriate general or
collective term to be used here is <em>paññā</em>, which refers to wisdom that
has been gradually cultivated by practising on the Path. At each
important stage of practice this wisdom has unique attributes and is
referred to by special terms, as will be discussed below.</p>
<p>According to the Middle Way, it is possible to present an outline of
wisdom development as follows:</p>
<p>For the average person, whose learning depends on the advice and
teachings of others, spiritual training will begin with some form of
belief, which in Buddhism is referred to as ’faith’ (<em>saddhā</em>).</p>
<p>This faith may be a belief in the the basic rationality of a particular
teaching, a general belief in logical analysis, or a confidence in the
reasoned presentation by a teacher. From this point on students receive
teachings, listen, study and train. This results in increased
understanding and a reasoned discernment within the students themselves
which is broadly referred to as <em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>.</p>
<p>When this understanding gradually grows and becomes more clear through
engagement or through experience, so that it becomes a realization,
wisdom has been developed to the stage of ’right knowledge’
(<em>sammā-ñāṇa</em>). This stage transcends all forms of belief (<em>saddhā</em>) and
reasoned opinion (<em>diṭṭhi</em>). This is the final stage, which reaches the
goal – liberation – which is referred to as ’right deliverance’
(<em>sammā-vimutti</em>).</p>
<p>Wisdom development can be illustrated thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Faith (<em>saddhā</em>) →<br />
right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>) →<br />
right knowledge (<em>sammā-ñāṇa</em>) →<br />
right deliverance (<em>sammā-vimutti</em>).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following this process, at the beginning wisdom exists in a latent form
or as an accessory to faith. Wisdom then gradually develops on its own
until it becomes right knowledge, at which stage it is pure and
outstanding. Here, faith no longer exists because it has been completely
replaced by wisdom. Only at this stage is awakening or liberation
possible. This process will be described in more detail in subsequent
chapters.</p>
<p>Note that the faith participating in this process is a faith conducive
to wisdom or leading to wisdom. The faith or belief must be accompanied
by wisdom or be based upon reasoned discernment (<em>ākāravatī-saddhā</em> or
<em>saddhā-ñāṇa-sampayutta</em>). It does not refer to faith in which one
blindly entrusts oneself to something without needing to apply reasoned
contemplation (<em>amūlikā-saddhā</em> or <em>saddhā-ñāṇa-vipayutta</em>).</p>
<p>In any case it is not adequate to view wisdom development or the
development of right view as beginning solely by way of faith.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, there are exceptional persons who are able to
cultivate wisdom without relying on faith in others. They rely entirely
on wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) – the ability to see things as
they truly are and according to causes and conditions – until they
develop wisdom to the stage of penetrative insight into truth.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn36-1"><a href="#fn-fn36">36</a></sup>
{559}</p>
<p>Likewise, the wisdom development of ordinary people, who begin with
faith, relies on their ability to apply wise reflection. Transcendent
wisdom in particular, which fathoms the truth and completely dispels
mental impurity, is unable to arise without wise reflection.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn37-1"><a href="#fn-fn37">37</a></sup>
Correct, desirable faith is linked to or activates wise reflection.
Therefore, the complete process should be illustrated as shown on
Figure <a href="#fig-wisdom-development">Wisdom Development</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">Wisdom Development</span><a id="fig-wisdom-development"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/wisdom-development.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>In sum, there are two factors giving rise to right view. First is faith
(<em>saddhā</em>), which refers to trust in or a reliance on the wisdom of
others. It arises as a response to the teachings of other people and it
marks the beginning of spiritual practice by way of external conditions.
Second is wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), which refers to an
ability to think for oneself or to think correctly. It marks the
beginning of spiritual practice by way of internal conditions.</p>
<p>The term <em>saddhā</em> does not refer directly to the source of a person’s
understanding, but is rather an internal spiritual quality connecting a
person to external factors. The real external source of understanding is
other people, who influence one’s beliefs, or the teachings of others,
which in Buddhism is referred to as the ’instruction by others’
(<em>paratoghosa</em>).</p>
<p>Besides helping to generate faith and acting as an indirect method for
establishing right view, the instruction by others can be a direct
impetus for applying wise reflection. For this reason the scriptures
present two sources or factors for right view: the external factor of
the words of others (<em>paratoghosa</em>) and the internal factor of wise
reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>).</p>
<p>Buddhism gives great emphasis to right view, because people, including
Buddhists themselves, generally do not give this Path factor sufficient
attention. Even when they do recognize its importance people often just
give it lip service, without going any further. For this reason it is
necessary to remind people to first acknowledge the importance of right
view, and even more importantly, to find ways to generate it.</p>
<p>Therefore, before discussing the various Path factors in subsequent
chapters, I wish to begin by describing at more length the conditions
for right view.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-1-traditional-definitions-of-the-threefold-training"><a class="header" href="#appendix-1-traditional-definitions-of-the-threefold-training">Appendix 1: Traditional Definitions of the Threefold Training</a></h2>
<p>A literal and orthodox translation of the threefold training is as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Adhisīla-sikkhā</em>: training as higher virtue; forms of practice for
training in supreme virtuous conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Adhicitta-sikkhā</em>: training as higher mind; forms of training the
mind in order to generate supreme concentration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>: training as higher wisdom; forms of training in
wisdom in order to reach supreme levels of realization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Pali Canon definitions for the threefold training are presented
solely in reference to the bhikkhus. Here, <em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em> refers to
restraint in accord with the monastic code of discipline
(<em>pāṭimokkhasaṁvara-sīla</em>), <em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em> refers to the four
jhānas, and <em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em> refers either to knowledge of the Four
Noble Truths or to realization of liberation of mind (<em>cetovimutti</em>) and
liberation by wisdom (<em>paññāvimutti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn38-1"><a href="#fn-fn38">38</a></sup> The Niddesa expands this
definition slightly.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn39-1"><a href="#fn-fn39">39</a></sup> {562}</p>
<p>The Paṭisambhidāmagga broadens this definition, defining <em>adhisīla</em> as
restraint (<em>saṁvara</em>), <em>adhicitta</em> as non-distraction, and <em>adhipaññā</em>
as right view or right understanding.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn40-1"><a href="#fn-fn40">40</a></sup></p>
<p>The Samantapāsādikā claims that the threefold training does not simply
refer to the five or ten precepts, the eight concentrative attainments,
or an understanding conforming to the law of karma, of reaping what one
sows, because these levels of morality, concentration and wisdom are
taught irrespective of whether a Buddha comes into the world or not.
Rather, the threefold training refers exclusively to the virtue,
concentration and wisdom accompanying the appearance of a Buddha, i.e.
<em>adhisīla</em> equals restraint in accord with the monastic code of
discipline, <em>adhicitta</em> equals the mind possessed of the eight
concentrative attainments, which act as a basis for insight, and
<em>adhipaññā</em> equals insight knowledge (<em>vipassanā-ñāṇa</em>) which is able to
discern the three characteristics.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn41-1"><a href="#fn-fn41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>In the highest sense, the commentaries say that the threefold training
refers to transcendent virtue, concentration, and wisdom, but this
definition can only be applied in limited contexts.</p>
<p>Occasionally they relax the definition, stating that <em>adhisīla</em> refers
to the moral conduct – either the five or ten precepts – undertaken by
someone who aims for Nibbāna, and <em>adhicitta</em> refers to the eight
concentrative attainments.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn42-1"><a href="#fn-fn42">42</a></sup> In regard to the passages in which the
Buddha speaks about ’higher virtue’ for laypeople,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn43-1"><a href="#fn-fn43">43</a></sup> the commentaries
say that this refers to the five or ten precepts.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn44-1"><a href="#fn-fn44">44</a></sup></p>
<p>Sometimes the prefix <em>adhi</em>- simply means ’better’ or ’higher’ when
comparing two things, for example the ten precepts are <em>adhisīla</em> in
comparison to the five precepts, and the fine-material mind
(<em>rūpāvacara-citta</em>) is <em>adhicitta</em> in comparison to the sense-sphere
mind (<em>kāmāvacara-citta</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn45-1"><a href="#fn-fn45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>In essence the threefold training refers to virtuous conduct,
concentration, and wisdom which are practised correctly according to the
Buddhist teachings and are conducive to advancing in spiritual
practice.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn46-1"><a href="#fn-fn46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentaries often describe the threefold training in the context of
various stages of abandoning mental defilement:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em> is equivalent to <em>vītikkama-pahāna</em>: moral conduct is a means
of abandoning coarse defilements, which are the cause for
transgressions by way of body and speech (<em>vītikkama-kilesa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samādhi</em> is equivalent to <em>pariyuṭṭhāna-pahāna</em>: concentration is a
means of abandoning intermediate defilements, which besiege the mind
(<em>pariyuṭṭhāna-kilesa</em>); some commentators state that this refers to
the five hindrances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paññā</em> is equivalent to <em>anusaya-pahāna</em>: wisdom is a means of
abandoning refined defilements, which lie hidden in one’s innate
character (<em>santāna</em>), waiting to manifest when conditions activate
them (<em>anusaya-kilesa</em>); this refers to the seven latent tendencies
(<em>anusaya</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Further definitions for the threefold training include: <em>sīla</em> =
abandonment by substitution of opposites (<em>tadaṅga-pahāna</em>), <em>samādhi</em> =
abandonment by suppression (<em>vikkhambhana-pahāna</em>), and <em>paññā</em> =
abandonment by cutting off (<em>samuccheda-pahāna</em>); and: <em>sīla</em> is a way
of abandoning immoral conduct, <em>samādhi</em> is a way of abandoning craving
(<em>taṇhā</em>), and <em>paññā</em> is a way of abandoning fixed views
(<em>diṭṭhi</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn47-1"><a href="#fn-fn47">47</a></sup></p>
<p>The Path factors are arranged into the three trainings in a similar way
that they are arranged into the three ’bodies of doctrine’
(<em>dhamma-khandha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn48-1"><a href="#fn-fn48">48</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="appendix-2-two-extremes"><a class="header" href="#appendix-2-two-extremes">Appendix 2: Two Extremes</a></h2>
<p>A passage from the Aṅguttara Nikāya defines <em>kāma-sukhallikānuyoga</em> as
<em>āgāḷha-paṭipadā</em> (rough path; coarse path), referring to those people
who believe that there is no harm in sensuality and who immerse
themselves in sense pleasures. It defines <em>atta-kilamathānuyoga</em> as
<em>nijjhāma-paṭipadā</em> (scorching path; parched path), referring to the
practices of the naked ascetics (Acelakas; this should be considered
merely as one example). It defines the Middle Way (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>)
as any of the groups of spiritual qualities contained in the
thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (<em>bodhipakkhiya-dhamma</em>: the four
foundations of mindfulness; the four right efforts; the four roads to
success; the five faculties; the five powers; the seven factors of
enlightenment; and the Eightfold Path).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn49-1"><a href="#fn-fn49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>The Udāna contains this passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">

<p>Those who set chief value to study, to moral conduct, to religious
rituals, to earning a living, to keeping the holy life, and to
pleasing (the devas) – this is one extreme. And those who hold the
belief that there is no harm in sensuality – this is the other
extreme. These two extremes increase ignorance and craving, which in
turn increase fixed views. Those who do not understand these two
extremes – one group gets bogged down, the other overreaches. Those
who understand these two extremes do not get caught up in them, and
they are not conceited due to this non-attachment. For these there is
no round (of rebirth) to be declared.</p>

<p>D. II. 49-50; Dh. verses 183-5. For the classification of this
teaching as matching the threefold training, see: DA. II. 479 and
DhA. III. 237. The Dīghanikāya Aṭṭhakathā states that the first
clause refers to moral restraint (<em>sīla-saṁvara</em>), the second clause
to tranquillity (<em>samatha</em>) and insight (<em>vipassanā</em>), i.e. to
concentration and wisdom, and the third clause to the fruit of
arahantship (<em>arahatta-phala</em>). The Dhammapada Aṭṭhakathā, however,
interprets the third clause to mean that simply cleaning the mind by
removing the five hindrances (<em>nīvaraṇa</em>) is equivalent to purifying
one’s mind. By referring to these two sources, one can define the
first clause as <em>sīla</em> (it is valid to expand this definition), the
second clause as <em>samādhi</em> and <em>paññā</em>, and the third clause also as
<em>samādhi</em> and <em>paññā</em> (here, one may also include <em>vimutti</em> –
liberation). In any case, the Visuddhimagga presents a simple
classification, as clause 1 = <em>sīla</em>, clause 2 = <em>samādhi</em>, and
clause 3 = <em>paññā</em>, respectively; see: Vism. 4-5. <a href="#fr-fn32-1">↩</a></p>

<p>The addition of these two factors to the Eightfold Path, thus
comprising ten factors, is referred to as the ten forms of
righteousness (<em>sammatta</em>) or the ten qualities of an adept
(<em>asekha-dhamma</em>); see: D. III. 271, 292. The commentaries state
that <em>sammā-ñāṇa</em> is equivalent to knowledge of fruition
(<em>phala-ñāṇa</em>) and knowledge of reviewing (<em>paccavekkhaṇa-ñāṇa</em>);
see: MA. I. 189; AA. II. 382. <em>Sammā-ñāṇa</em> is the final stage of

<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>All of the Buddhist teachings, regardless of their name or title, are
interrelated and part of a whole. They all point to the same truth and
they all lead to the same goal. They are given different names in order
to point out specific aspects of truth, or else they refer to the same
thing but look at it from different angles, depending on the particular
aim of the teaching. For this reason, certain Dhamma teachings or
principles are subsidiary to a larger teaching, whereas others are
equally important and cover the same subject material, but have unique
formats and objectives.</p>
<p>The teaching of Dependent Origination (<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>) describes the
entire process of human existence, and it encompasses all the other
Dhamma teachings in a comprehensive way. It is a complete teaching. If
one comprehends Dependent Origination, one understands the essence of
existence or the entirety of Buddhism, as confirmed by the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>One who sees Dependent Origination sees the Dhamma.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 190-91.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In any case, it is generally acknowledged that Dependent Origination is
profound and extremely difficult to understand. Even explaining it is
very difficult. For this reason there are almost no texts dedicated
solely to explaining Dependent Origination. It is much more common to
find texts that explain other divisions or principles of the Dhamma,
which are part of the teaching on Dependent Origination.</p>
<p>Of these subsidiary teachings, perhaps the most frequently explained is
that on kamma.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1-1"><a href="#fn-fn1">1</a></sup> The reason for this is twofold: first, this is a
subject that is of vital interest to people, and second, an
understanding of kamma acts as a bridge to understanding Dependent
Origination. Indeed, a thorough explanation of kamma is one method for
making the task of explaining Dependent Origination somewhat easier.</p>
<p>Kamma is only one part of the process outlined in Dependent Origination,
which can be divided into three distinct cycles (<em>vaṭṭa</em>): defilement
(<em>kilesa</em>), kamma, and the fruits of kamma (<em>vipāka</em>). Dependent
Origination describes the entire sequence of performing volitional
actions (<em>kamma</em>) and receiving the consequences of those actions,
beginning with mental defilement, which is the source of kamma, and
culminating in the fruits of kamma (<em>vipāka</em>).</p>
<p>Having described the law of Dependent Origination, along with its
component factors, it may seem unnecessary to present a separate
explanation on kamma. One may claim that by understanding Dependent
Origination one also gains a clear understanding of kamma. {235}</p>
<p>The exposition of Dependent Origination focuses on phenomena in a pure,
absolute sense, and it provides a broad, comprehensive perspective of a
natural process. It does not emphasize one specific aspect of this
process. From a practical, everyday point of view, however, the part of
Dependent Origination that is most pronounced, directly pertains to
human behaviour, and is connected to human responsibility, is kamma.
From this perspective, one can say that kamma is the chief factor or
theme in Dependent Origination, and that the other factors simply
support investigation.</p>
<p>If one chooses this approach of analysis, Dependent Origination appears
in the form known as the ’law of kamma’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn2-1"><a href="#fn-fn2">2</a></sup> And because there are many
other crucial factors related to this subject, in later texts the law of
kamma became the focus of study more than Dependent Origination. The
discussion of kamma deals with human behaviour, which is relatively
coarse, easily apparent, pertains to each immediate moment, and is
suitable as the starting point of study.</p>
<p>Moreover, the explanation of kamma can be done at many different levels.
One can explain it on a superficial level, describing cause and effect
to an ordinary lay audience; one can describe unique human circumstances
or activities in relation to kamma; or one can delve deeper into various
mental processes and explain kamma in the context of Dependent
Origination in its complete format.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that a separate chapter has been dedicated to
the subject of kamma.</p>

<h3 id="kamma-as-a-law-of-nature"><a class="header" href="#kamma-as-a-law-of-nature">Kamma as a Law of Nature</a></h3>
<p>Buddhism teaches the truth that all things, both animate and inanimate,
both material and immaterial, both physical and mental, both internal
and external – that is, all conditioned things (<em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>) –
exist according to causes and conditions; they are subject to mutual
conditionality. This is a law of nature. The Pali term for such a law of
nature is <em>niyāma</em>, which literally translates as ’fixed with
certainty’, ’mode of certainty’, ’rule of certainty’, or ’possessed of a
certain orderliness’. When specific causes and conditions are present,
things must proceed in a certain fashion.</p>
<p>Although this law of nature possesses the uniform characteristic of
mutual conditionality, it can be divided according to distinct
attributes, which express various patterns or aspects of
interrelationship and facilitate understanding. Based on a Buddhist line
of thinking, the commentaries describe five distinct laws of nature
(<em>niyāma</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn3-1"><a href="#fn-fn3">3</a></sup> {236}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Utu-niyāma</em>: law of energy; law of physical phenomena; physical
inorganic order; physical laws. This refers in particular to the
external environment and to alterations in physical matter. E.g.:
the weather and seasons; the fact that water, soil, and fertilizer
assist the growth of plants; the fact that lotus blossoms open
during the day and close up at night; the process of sneezing and
coughing; and the fact that all things are subject to corrosion and
decay. The focus by the commentaries here is on alterations induced
by heat and temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bīja-niyāma</em>: genetic laws; law of heredity; laws of reproduction;
physical organic order; biological laws. For example: the fact that
a specific plant will produce a specific fruit; a mango tree, for
instance, will always bear mangos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Citta-niyāma</em>: psychic law; psychological laws; the laws of nature
pertaining to the functioning of the mind. For example: when a sense
stimulus contacts a sense base, cognition arises – the passive
state of mind (<em>bhavaṅga-citta</em>) is shaken and interrupted, there is
adverting of the mind (<em>āvajjana</em>), seeing, hearing, etc.,
acceptance (<em>sampaṭicchanna</em>), judgement (<em>santīraṇa</em>), etc.;
specific mind states may be accompanied by certain mental
concomitants (<em>cetasika</em>), whereas they may not be accompanied by
others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kamma-niyāma</em>: law of kamma; order of act and result; kammic laws;
moral laws. Natural laws pertaining to human behaviour. More
specifically, this refers to the process of intention and the
process of conceptualization, along with corresponding results of
these mental activities. For example: if one performs good actions,
one reaps good results; if one performs bad actions, one reaps bad
results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dhamma-niyāma</em>: general law of cause and effect; order of the norm.
The law of nature pertaining to the interrelationship and mutual
conditionality of all things. For example: all things arise, are
sustained, and come to an end; it is the norm that human beings are
born, age, fall ill, and die; the normal lifespan of human beings at
this time era is roughly one hundred years; regardless of whether a
Buddha appears or not, it is part of the natural order that all
things are impermanent, <em>dukkha</em> (’subject to pressure’), and
nonself (<em>anattā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first four kinds of laws are in fact included in the fifth law, of
<em>dhamma-niyāma</em>, or one can say that they are divisions stemming from
this law. The definition of <em>dhamma-niyāma</em> encompasses all five kinds
of laws.</p>
<p>It is accurate to say that <em>dhamma-niyāma</em> is the chief, over-arching
law. In this case, some people may argue that if one is going to list
subsidiary laws in detail, then this list should be exhaustive. Why does
<em>dhamma-niyāma</em> remain along with these four subsidiary laws?</p>
<p>This can be answered with a simple analogy. When the entire human
population of a country is described, it may be divided say into
’government leaders, civil servants, merchants, and the general
populace’, or ’soldiers, police, civil servants, students, and the
general public’. Indeed, the terms ’general populace’ and ’general
public’ can refer to all individuals in society. Civil servants,
businessmen, soldiers, and students are all part of the general
population. The reason why these individuals may be distinguished from
the rest is because they have unique attributes, which the person making
the division wishes to emphasize, depending on his or her objective.
{237} On each occasion, the term ’general populace’, or a similar term,
is used to incorporate all the remaining individuals. The description of
the five natural laws can be viewed in the same way.</p>
<p>It is not our task here to examine whether other subsidiary laws should
be added to this list. The commentators selected these five in accord
with their own personal objectives. Moreover, the four subsidiary laws
are all incorporated in the factor of <em>dhamma-niyāma</em>, as just
explained. The point of interest here is to examine the true
significance and purpose of describing these five laws. Here are a few
points to consider:</p>
<p>First, this presentation provides a cogent view of the Buddhist way of
thought, describing the causal nature of everything in the world.
Although these five natural laws are distinguished from one another, the
primary emphasis is on mutual conditionality. This provides Dhamma
practitioners with a clearly defined principle for study, practice, and
understanding. They need not get caught up in the debate whether a
Creator God alters the natural flow of conditions, deviating from the
norm (unless one considers that God simply participates like other
conditions in the natural process).</p>
<p>Some people may object here and voice the opinion: without a Creator of
these laws, surely they could not have come into existence? One need not
get caught up in such questions, which only mislead and beguile people.
If one accepts that things exist according to their own nature, then
they must proceed in a certain way. Things have always proceeded in
conformity with their naturally dictated course. It is impossible for
them to proceed other than by mutual conditionality. Human beings
observe and understand these patterns and proceedings and refer to them
as natural laws. But whether they are distinguished and labelled as laws
or not, they exist all the same.</p>
<p>If one insists that someone must have created the laws of nature, then
one is faced with all sorts of troubling questions, like: ’What laws
dictate the actions of the Creator?’ and ’Who supervises the Creator?’
If in reply one claims that the Creator acts entirely by his own will,
then surely he is able to change the laws according to his whim. Some
day, he may alter the laws and create chaos for human beings. (Indeed,
if such a Creator of natural laws were to exist, and he is endowed with
compassion, he would change some laws in order to assist people. For
example, he would prevent the birth of handicapped, crippled, or
mentally impaired people.)</p>
<p>Second, when one divides the law of causality into subsidiary laws, it
is important not to attribute resultant phenomena as belonging
exclusively and categorically to one particular law. In fact, a single
result may arise from various causes or pertain to several laws in
combination. The fact that a lotus blooms only during the day, for
example, is not solely due to physical laws, but it is also due to
biological laws. The reason why a person is crying may be due to
psychological laws, say of being sad or elated, or it may occur due to
physical laws, say of getting smoke in the eyes. Someone may be sweating
due to physical laws, say because it is hot, or due to psychological and
kammic laws, say because he is afraid or recalls doing something wrong.
One may have a headache due to physical laws, say from muggy weather, a
stuffy room, or a lack of oxygen, or due to biological laws, say from
some defect in one’s body, or due to a combination of kammic laws and
psychic laws, say from anxiety and distress.</p>
<p>Third, and most important, the commentaries reveal how the law of kamma
is incorporated among these natural laws. {238}</p>
<p>In relation to human beings, <em>kamma-niyāma</em> is the most important of
these subsidiary laws, because it is a matter that affects everyone
directly. Human beings create kamma, which in turn determines their
destiny.</p>
<p>Modern people tend to divide the various forces in the world, by setting
nature in contrast with human beings. Following this division, kammic
laws belong to the scope of activities belonging to human beings. All of
the other subsidiary laws pertain to the sphere of nature.</p>
<p>Human beings are children of nature and are part of nature. But human
beings possess a unique capacity, of operating under moral or kammic
laws (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>). They form communities and invent things by way of
their volitional actions, almost creating a separate or parallel world
to that of the natural world.</p>
<p>Within the sphere of <em>kamma-niyāma</em>, the essence or core of kamma is
intention or volition. The law of kamma embraces the entire world of
intention or the world of creativity (and destruction) arising from
human beings’ ingenuity and innovation. <em>Kamma-niyāma</em> is the prevailing
law for human beings, regardless of whether they engage with other laws
or not. Indeed the very engagement with other laws depends on the law of
kamma.</p>
<p>The domain of volitional activity enables human beings to influence,
alter, and create things. More accurately, the participation by people
as one cause and condition within natural processes, to the extent that
they claim to be able to control or defeat nature, is dependent on the
law of kamma. People intentionally engage with other laws existing
within the sphere of nature, studying them and acting accordingly, or
deriving benefit from them. For this reason it is said that intention
determines and shapes the natural world. Furthermore, human intention
determines social interactions.</p>
<p>Besides shaping social interactions and behaviour in relation to
external things, the environment, and nature in general, human beings,
or more accurately, human intentions, have an effect on people
themselves, shaping their personalities and determining their fate.</p>
<p>The law of kamma encompasses the world of intention and all forms of
human creativity. It is the key factor in moulding each individual’s
life. It determines the course of human society and all human creative
and destructive activities. It is the basis on which people engage with
other laws, in order to control the natural world. For this reason,
great emphasis is given in Buddhism to the principle of kamma. The
Buddha said: ’The world exists according to kamma’ (<em>kammunā vattatī
loko</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn4-1"><a href="#fn-fn4">4</a></sup> Kamma is thus a vital teaching in Buddhism.</p>
<p>The inclusion of <em>kamma-niyāma</em> in the group of five laws also indicates
that the law of kamma is simply one of several laws of nature.
Therefore, when a phenomenon occurs, or when someone experiences some
form of affliction, do not wrongly presume that it is solely due to
kamma.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn5-1"><a href="#fn-fn5">5</a></sup> {239}</p>
<p>The Buddha’s quote (above), ’The world exists according to kamma,’
refers to the world of living beings, or to the world of human beings.
In other words, kamma governs and determines human society.</p>
<p>In sum, <em>kamma-niyāma</em> is a subsidiary law of nature, but it is the most
important law for human beings.</p>
<p>Apart from the five aforementioned laws, there exists another law
pertaining exclusively to human beings. It is not inherent in nature nor
is it directly connected to nature. This refers to those laws and
conventions set down by human beings themselves, in order to regulate
social behaviour and to promote social wellbeing. These social
prescriptions include policies, rules, pacts, legislation, traditions,
customs, disciplinary codes, etc. One may affix this sixth law as an
appendix to the five laws of nature mentioned above.</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience, one may designate a similar heading for
this group of social prescriptions to those laws of nature. Yet one
needs to be aware that this so-called ’sixth law’ lies outside and apart
from the group of five natural laws. There are many such headings to
choose from, including: <em>saṅgama-niyāma</em> (’social law’),
<em>saṅgama-niyamana</em> (’social practice’), <em>sammati-niyāma</em> (’conventional
law’), and <em>paññatti-niyāma</em> (’prescribed law’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn6-1"><a href="#fn-fn6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>All four of these example headings make it clear that they are referring
to human laws rather than to natural laws. The first two terms refer to
social prescriptions. The third term refers to human conventions, to
those mutual agreements established in society. The fourth term refers
to human prescriptions and stipulations.</p>
<p>Here, in this text, the term ’conventional law’ (<em>sammati-niyāma</em>) is
used to refer to these human-made laws.</p>
<p>These social criteria and guidelines are fashioned by human beings. They
thus result from intentional actions and are related to the law of kamma
(<em>kamma-niyāma</em>). Yet they are supplementary to the law of kamma – they
do not constitute <em>kamma-niyāma</em> per se. They are not characterized by
mutual conditionality, nor are they aspects of natural truth in the way
that <em>kamma-niyāma</em> is. Because they overlap with the law of kamma, the
difference between the two tends to cause confusion, which in turn leads
to numerous debates and misunderstandings among people.</p>
<p>Because these two kinds of laws – the law of kamma (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>) and
conventional laws (<em>sammati-niyāma</em>) – have the greatest bearing on
human beings, it is important to point out their distinctive attributes.</p>
<p>First, <em>kamma-niyāma</em> is a law of nature dealing with human actions.
Conventional or social laws are established by people themselves. They
are related to the laws of nature only to the extent of being a result
of human intentional activity. Second, by way of the law of kamma, human
beings are accountable to their actions according to the dynamics of
nature. In the context of social laws, however, people must take
responsibility for their actions according to the decrees formulated by
people themselves.</p>
<p>These aspects of kamma will be discussed at more length in later
sections of this chapter, on questions of good and evil, and on matters
concerning the reaping of results stemming from intentional actions.

<h3 id="definition-of-kamma"><a class="header" href="#definition-of-kamma">Definition of Kamma</a></h3>
<p>The term ’kamma’ literally means ’action’ or ’work’. In the context of
Dhamma teachings, however, the definition is restricted to mean ’actions
accompanied by intention’ or ’volitional actions’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn7-1"><a href="#fn-fn7">7</a></sup> Actions that
occur without intention are not classified as kamma in this context.</p>
<p>This definition of kamma, however, is very broad. To truly understand
the meaning of this term, its definition should be examined from
different angles or presented as different layers of meaning:</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A.</strong> A direct or precise examination of kamma reveals that its essence or
source is <em>cetanā</em>: intention, volition, deliberation; a
determination to act; the force or agent behind action. Intention is
chief, defining a person’s aims and purposes, and determining the
direction of all human actions. It initiates action and all forms of
conceptual and creative activity. It thus lies at the heart of
kamma. This is confirmed by the Buddha’s words: ’It is intention,
bhikkhus, that I call kamma’ (<em>cetanāhaṁ bhikkhave kammaṁ vadāmi</em>).
With intention, people then act by way of body, speech, and
mind.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn8-1"><a href="#fn-fn8">8</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>B.</strong> A broader perspective, taking into account other factors within the
dynamics of human activity, reveals that volitional action (’kamma’)
acts as the leading agent in creating the structure and pathway of
people’s lives. Kamma in this sense is equivalent to, or is referred
to as, ’volitional formations’ (<em>saṅkhāra</em>), which can also be
translated as ’fashioners of the mind’. This interpretation is found
for instance as one of the twelve links in Dependent Origination.
The term <em>saṅkhāra</em> refers to those mental factors or properties,
with intention (<em>cetanā</em>) as leader, that shape the mind as
wholesome, unwholesome, or neutral. They determine people’s
thoughts, speech, and physical actions, resulting in various kinds
of intentional action. In brief, <em>saṅkhāra</em> may be described as
’mental conceptualization’, yet even here intention is considered
the principal factor. Indeed, the Buddha occasionally defined
<em>saṅkhāra</em> simply as intention (<em>cetanā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn9-1"><a href="#fn-fn9">9</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C.</strong> An even wider perspective examines human beings as a whole,
conventionally referred to as individual persons, who engage with
the external world and have responsibility for their own actions.
Kamma in this context refers to thoughts, speech, and physical
actions – behaviour for which people must reap results, regardless
of whether these results occur in the immediate present or further
removed in the past and future.</p>
<p>This aspect of kamma is the most frequently mentioned in the texts,
appearing in teachings addressed to specific individuals. Such
teachings encourage people to take responsibility for their personal
actions and to perform wholesome deeds, as is confirmed by these
words of the Buddha: {241}</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these two things that cause distress. Which two?
There is the case of the person who has not done what is good, has not
done what is wholesome, and has not performed meritorious deeds, which
counteract fear. Instead he has done what is evil, savage and cruel.
Thinking, ’I have not done what is wholesome; I have done what is
evil’, he is distressed.</p>
<p><em>It. 25-6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>It is noteworthy that in the modern time this is the most common
interpretation of kamma, especially in reference to past actions.</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li><strong>D.</strong> The broadest perspective is to examine general human activities
evident in human society. Here, kamma refers to earning a
livelihood, conducting one’s life, and engaging in various
activities, which result from intention and conceptualization. This
interpretation is described by the Buddha in the Vāseṭṭha Sutta:</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>You should know, Vāseṭṭha, that whoever makes his living among men by
cattle herding is called a farmer; he is not a brahmin … whoever
makes his living by varied crafts is called a craftsman … whoever
makes his living by trade is called a merchant … he who makes his
living by serving others is called a servant … whoever makes his
living by stealing is called a robber … whoever makes his living by
arrows and swords is called a soldier … whoever makes his living by
priestly craft is called a chaplain … whoever governs among men the
town and realm is called a king; he is not a brahmin…. One who has
no mental impurities lingering in the mind, who clings no more, he is
the one I call a brahmin….</p>
<p>One is not a brahmin by birth, nor by birth a non-brahmin. By action
(kamma) is one a brahmin, by action is one a non-brahmin. By their
acts (kamma: work, occupation, behaviour, lifestyle) are men farmers,
craftsmen, merchants, servants, robbers, soldiers, chaplains, and even
kings. This is how the wise see action as it really is, seers of
Dependent Origination, skilled in action and its results. Action makes
the world go round; action makes this generation of beings wander on.</p>
<p><em>M. II. 196; Sn. 117-23.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Similarly, in the Aggañña Sutta:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Then those beings who were elders met together and confided their
troubles with one another: ’Sirs, various evils have arisen among us,
giving rise to theft, accusations, lying, and the taking up of clubs
and batons. Let this not be so. Suppose we were to appoint (sammati:
’consent to’) a certain being who would admonish where admonishment
was due, censure those who deserved it, and banish those who deserved
banishment. And in return we would grant him a share of the grain.’</p>
<p>So they went to the one among them who was the most dignified, the
most attractive, the most charismatic and awe-inspiring, and asked him
to do this for them in return for a share of the grain, and he
agreed…. {242} Because he was chosen by the people, the first
regular title of Mahā Sammata (’Great Authority’) came to be.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn10-1"><a href="#fn-fn10">10</a></sup></p>
<p><em>D. III. 92-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Similarly, in the Cakkavatti Sutta:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, when the king did not furnish property to the needy, poverty
became rife; from the growth of poverty, stealing increased; from the
increase of theft, the use of weapons increased; from the increased
use of weapons, the taking of life increased – and from the increase
of killing, lying increased … divisive speech … adultery …
offensive speech and trivial talk … covetousness and ill-will …
wrong view increased.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn11-1"><a href="#fn-fn11">11</a></sup></p>
<p><em>D. III. 70-71.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Although one may define kamma into these four distinct categories, one
should remember that in each case intention (<em>cetanā</em>) lies at the heart
of such actions. Intention leads people to engage with things and
determines the manner of such engagement. It determines how people
respond to things and how they alter or improve things. It determines
whether one makes oneself a channel for expressing unwholesome qualities
of greed, hatred, and delusion, or instead for expressing wholesome
qualities in order to foster true wellbeing. All this is under the power
of intention.</p>
<p>Actions free from intention do not effect results within the domain of
the law of kamma – they are not classified as kamma. Rather, they are
matters pertaining to other laws of nature, in particular to physical
laws (<em>utu-niyāma</em>). They are seen as equivalent to landslides or to a
branch falling from a tree.</p>
<h3 id="kinds-of-kamma"><a class="header" href="#kinds-of-kamma">Kinds of Kamma</a></h3>
<p>From the perspective of its quality or source, kamma is divided into two
factors:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn12-1"><a href="#fn-fn12">12</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unwholesome actions (<em>akusala-kamma</em>): unskilful actions; bad
actions. This refers to those actions stemming from unwholesome
roots, i.e. greed (<em>lobha</em>), hatred (<em>dosa</em>), and delusion (<em>moha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wholesome actions (<em>kusala-kamma</em>): skilful actions; good actions.
This refers to those actions stemming from wholesome roots, i.e.
non-greed (<em>alobha</em>), non-hatred (<em>adosa</em>), and non-delusion
(<em>amoha</em>). {243}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If one divides kamma according to the ’doorway’ (<em>dvāra</em>) by which
actions are performed – the pathways of expression – the
classification is threefold:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn13-1"><a href="#fn-fn13">13</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Physical actions (<em>kāya-kamma</em>): actions by way of the body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verbal actions (<em>vacī-kamma</em>): actions by way of speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental actions (<em>mano-kamma</em>): actions by way of the mind.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Combining the two aforementioned classifications results in six kinds of
kamma: unwholesome physical, verbal, and mental actions, and wholesome
physical, verbal, and mental actions.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn14-1"><a href="#fn-fn14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Another classification divides kamma into four factors according to the
relationship actions have to their results (<em>vipāka</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn15-1"><a href="#fn-fn15">15</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dark actions with dark results: this refers to physical, verbal, and
mental volitional formations (<em>kāya-saṅkhāra</em>, <em>vacī-saṅkhāra</em>, and
<em>mano-saṅkhāra</em>) that are harmful and oppressive. Basic examples
include: injuring other creatures (<em>pāṇātipāta</em>), stealing
(<em>adinnādāna</em>), sexual misconduct (<em>kāmesu-micchācāra</em>), lying
(<em>musāvādā</em>), and heedlessly indulging in alcoholic beverages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bright actions with bright results: this refers to physical, verbal,
and mental volitional formations that are neither harmful nor
oppressive. An example is upholding the ten wholesome courses of
action (<em>kusala-kammapathā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bright and dark actions with bright and dark results: this refers to
physical, verbal, and mental volitional formations that are partly
harmful and partly non-harmful. Most human behaviour falls under
this category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither bright-nor-dark actions with neither bright-nor-dark
results: this refers to those actions performed in order to bring an
end to kamma, i.e. intention aimed at abandoning the three
aforementioned kinds of kamma. In terms of spiritual qualities, this
refers to the seven factors of enlightenment (<em>bojjhaṅga</em>) or to the
Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The commentaries contain another classification of kamma, into twelve
factors, i.e. into three groups of four factors. This classification was
favoured by later generations of Buddhist scholars, as is seen by the
description in the Visuddhimagga. To prevent confusion, however, it will
not be presented here.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn16-1"><a href="#fn-fn16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Of the three kinds of kamma mentioned above, i.e. physical, verbal, and
mental kamma, mental kamma is of the greatest importance and has the
most widespread and major consequences, as confirmed by the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Of these three kinds of action, Tapassī, thus analyzed and
distinguished, I describe mental action as the most harmful in the
performance of evil action, in the perpetration of evil action, and
not bodily action or verbal action.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 373.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Mental kamma is the most important because it is the point of origin.
People think before they speak or act; they think before they express
themselves by way of speech or physical actions. Verbal kamma and
physical kamma are thus extensions of mental kamma. Moreover, mental
kamma encompasses beliefs, opinions, doctrines, ways of thinking, and
values, which are collectively referred to as ’view’ (<em>diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
<p>View (<em>diṭṭhi</em>) determines people’s general conduct and lifestyle, as
well as the direction of society. People’s thoughts, speech, teachings,
instructions, actions, etc. all spring from their beliefs, viewpoints,
and values. {244} If people harbour wrong view (<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>), their
thoughts, speech, and actions will also be incorrect (<em>micchā</em>); if they
harbour right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>), their thoughts, speech, and actions
will be correct (<em>sammā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn17-1"><a href="#fn-fn17">17</a></sup> For example, if a society believes that
material affluence is of utmost value and truly desirable, people will
pursue material wealth, and they will use wealth as the yardstick for
measuring progress, prestige, and dignity. People’s lifestyles and the
direction of society will follow a particular mode or format. Another
society, which considers spiritual peace and happiness to be the highest
goal will follow another mode of behaviour.</p>
<p>There are many teachings by the Buddha expressing the significance of
wrong view and right view, for example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen
unwholesome states arise and arisen unwholesome states increase and
expand so much as wrong view….</p>
<p>Monks, I do not see even a single thing on account of which unarisen
wholesome states arise and arisen wholesome states increase and expand
so much as right view.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 30.</em></p>
<p>Monks, for a person of wrong view, whatever bodily kamma, verbal
kamma, and mental kamma he maintains and undertakes in accord with
that view, and whatever his intention, yearning, inclination, and
volitional activities, they all lead to what is unwished for,
undesired, and disagreeable, to harm and suffering. For what reason?
Because the view is bad. Suppose a seed of neem, snake gourd, or
bitter gourd were planted in moist soil. Whatever nutrients it takes
up from the soil and from the water would all lead to its bitter,
pungent, and distasteful flavour. For what reason? Because the seed is
bad….</p>
<p>Monks, for a person of right view, whatever bodily kamma, verbal
kamma, and mental kamma he maintains and undertakes in accord with
that view, and whatever his intention, yearning, inclination, and
volitional activities, they all lead to what is wished for, desired,
and agreeable, to wellbeing and happiness. For what reason? Because
the view is good. Suppose a seed of sugarcane, hulled wheat, or gold
apple were planted in moist soil. Whatever nutrients it takes up from
the soil and from the water would all lead to its sweet, agreeable,
and delectable flavour. For what reason? Because the seed is good.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 32; cf.: A. V. 212.</em></p>
<p>Monks, there is one person who arises in the world for the harm of
many people, for the unhappiness of many people, for the ruin, harm,
and suffering of many people, of devas and human beings. Who is that
one person? It is one who holds wrong view and has a perverted
perspective. He draws many people away from the true Dhamma and
establishes them in an untrue Dhamma…. {245}</p>
<p>Monks, there is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of

</div>
<h2 id="criteria-for-good-and-evil"><a class="header" href="#criteria-for-good-and-evil">Criteria for Good and Evil</a></h2>
<h3 id="good-and-evil"><a class="header" href="#good-and-evil">Good and Evil</a></h3>
<p>The subject of kamma is directly related to the subject of good and
evil. To understand kamma more clearly it is thus important to touch
upon the subject of good and evil.</p>
<p>The concept of good and evil (or good and bad) poses a difficulty on
account of the meanings of these words in English and the criteria for
evaluation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn20-1"><a href="#fn-fn20">20</a></sup> What determines something to be ’good’ or ’evil’?</p>
<p>This dilemma, however, is primarily confined to English. The Pali terms
dealing with these concepts are clearly defined, as will be discussed
below.</p>
<p>The English word ’good’, in particular, has a very broad range of
meaning. Someone who behaves virtuously is called a ’good person’; when
people eat delicious, agreeable food, they call the food or the
restaurant where it is served ’good’; an engine that runs efficiently or
smoothly is called ’good’; a wooden mallet that serves its purpose is
called ’good’; a movie that is fun and enjoyable is called ’good’; a
painting beautiful from an artistic point of view is called ’good’, or
if it fetches a high price it is called ’good’; likewise, a successful,
well-managed school with clever students is called ’good’. The same
table may be called ’good’ by three different people, but for various
reasons. One person says it is good because he considers it beautifully
crafted; the second says it is good because it serves his purpose for
writing; and the third says it is good because he can sell it for a high
profit.</p>
<p>Similarly, the same object called good by one person may be called bad
by others. Some things seen from one perspective are good, while seen
from another perspective are bad. Some behaviour in one country or
society may be considered good, while in other countries or societies it
is considered bad. There are no conclusive answers or completely clear
guidelines. One may have to distinguish between ’morally good’,
’aesthetically good’, and ’economically good’. {246}</p>
<p>The reason for this confusion is that these are matters having to do
with a sense of value. The terms ’good’ and ’bad’ can be used across the
entire spectrum when referring to a sense of value. Therefore, these
terms’ definitions are so broad and diverse.</p>
<p>To avoid this confusion, we need not use these English terms ’good’ and
’bad’ in this context. This way we need not discuss the relative merits
or value of things as they appear to different people.</p>
<p>There are a few points to bear in mind regarding this subject of good
and evil in relation to kamma:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In this context of good and evil, the specific Pali terms <em>kusala</em>
(’wholesome’) and <em>akusala</em> (’unwholesome’) are used, respectively.
These two terms have clearly prescribed definitions and principles
for evaluation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The analysis of good and evil here is directly related to the law of
kamma (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>). In the study of Buddhist ethics, the
concepts of wholesomeness and unwholesomeness are thus viewed as
natural phenomena (<em>sabhāva</em>). They are not viewed in light of a
relative sense of value.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn21-1"><a href="#fn-fn21">21</a></sup> The study of relative value pertains
to the level of conventional truth (<em>sammati-niyāma</em>) or of social
prescriptions (<em>saṅgama-paññatti</em>), whose perimeters are clearly
distinguished from the law of kamma (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The law of kamma is connected to other laws. The connections of
particular importance include: internally, i.e. within an individual
person, the law of kamma (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>) is based on psychological
laws (<em>citta-niyāma</em>); and externally, the law of nature is
connected to conventional laws (<em>sammati-niyāma</em>). In regard to this
latter relationship, it is important to clearly separate the
boundaries between the law of kamma and conventional laws, although
there is a link between them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-wholesome-and-the-unwholesome"><a class="header" href="#the-wholesome-and-the-unwholesome">The Wholesome and the Unwholesome</a></h3>
<p>Although the Pali terms <em>kusala</em> and <em>akusala</em> are frequently translated
as ’good’ and ’bad’ respectively, this is not a truly accurate
definition. Some things may be wholesome (<em>kusala</em>) yet in English they
may not be called ’good’; likewise, some things may be unwholesome
(<em>akusala</em>) but in English they may not be referred to as ’bad’.</p>
<p>Wholesomeness and unwholesomeness arise in the mind, and they begin by
producing effects on the mind and by influencing a person’s personality;
these effects are then expressed outwardly. The meaning of these two
terms – <em>kusala</em> and <em>akusala</em> – thus focuses on the essential basis
for wholesome and unwholesome action: the principal emphasis is on the
internal workings of the mind.</p>
<p>The term <em>kusala</em> literally means ’skilful’, ’skilled’, ’proficient’,
’dextrous’, ’easeful’, ’favourable’, ’supportive’, ’appropriate’,
’virtuous’, ’meritorious’, ’the elimination of base, repellent
qualities’, or ’the dispelling of illness’.</p>
<p>The term <em>akusala</em> refers to those conditions that are foes of <em>kusala</em>
or stand in opposition to <em>kusala</em>, for example a lack of skill or a
lack of ease.</p>
<p>In the scriptures, there are four principal definitions for the term
<em>kusala</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Ārogya</em>: freedom from illness: the state of mind free from illness;
a state of mental health. This refers to those conditions and
factors that are conducive to mental health and help to ward off
mental illness. When these factors are present, the mind is not
distressed, agitated, impaired, or weak; rather, it is robust,
nimble, pliable, and at ease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anavajja</em>: harmless; blameless. This refers to a mind that is
non-defective, non-corrupted, unblemished, and undisturbed. The mind
is complete, pure, clear, and bright. {247}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kosalla-sambhūta</em>: springing from wisdom; stemming from
intelligence. The mind is endowed with wisdom or with those
attributes resulting from understanding. The mind is luminous,
seeing into the truth. This is consistent with the principle stating
that wholesome qualities have wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>)
as proximate cause (<em>padaṭṭhāna</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sukha-vipāka</em>: possessing happiness as fruition; leading to
happiness. When wholesome qualities are present in the mind,
happiness and contentment arise immediately; one need not wait for a
reward or compensation from outside. Similarly, when the body is
strong and healthy (<em>aroga</em>), when one is free of all harmful,
impure, or toxic elements (<em>anavajja</em>), and one has the knowledge
that one is in a safe and suitable place (<em>kosalla-sambhūta</em>),
although one may not experience any exceptional states of mind, one
is inherently happy and at ease.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some texts mention three more definitions for <em>kusala</em>: ’intelligent’
(<em>cheka</em>; ’clever’); ’safe’ (<em>khema</em>; ’secure’); and ’free from anxiety’
(<em>niddaratha</em>). These three definitions, however, are already included
in the four definitions mentioned above.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn22-1"><a href="#fn-fn22">22</a></sup> Note also that the third
definition above – <em>kosalla-sambhūta</em> – is the primary definition for
<em>kusala</em>.</p>
<p>The meaning of <em>akusala</em> can be interpreted as opposite to those
definitions of <em>kusala</em> above. This term refers to an unsound state of
mind, to a lack of mental health. Unwholesome qualities are detrimental,
reproachable, and faulty; they stem from ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>) and bear
fruit as suffering. In sum, they weaken and impair the mind. This stands
in contrast to wholesome qualities, which support and strengthen the
mind.</p>
<p>To clarify this matter, one can describe the various attributes of a
mind that is wholesome, healthy, pure, etc. Wholesome qualities
(<em>kusala-dhamma</em>) engender these attributes or these states of mind.
Conversely, unwholesome qualities (<em>akusala-dhamma</em>) impair or corrupt
the mind.</p>
<p>The following wholesome attributes are drawn from various passages in
the Pali Canon. They range from attributes present in the minds of
ordinary human beings, up to those attributes present in the minds of
fully awakened beings – the arahants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Group #1:</strong> <em>passaddha</em>: relaxed, tranquil, calm; <em>lahu</em>:
lightness of mind; <em>mudu</em>: gentle, tender, mild; <em>kamañña</em>: wieldy,
ready for work; <em>paguṇa</em>: adroit; <em>uju</em>: upright, not crooked, not
distorted.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn23-1"><a href="#fn-fn23">23</a></sup></em></p>
<p><strong>Group #2:</strong> <em>mudu</em>: gentle, mild; <em>kammanīya</em>: wieldy, suitable for

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>For ease of memory, these attributes may be divided into various main
headings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Stability: e.g.: steadfast, steady, even, unshakeable, unwavering,
non-agitated, non-vacillating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purity: e.g.: untainted, unmuddied, unstained, unblemished, clear,
bright, brilliant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom: e.g.: unentangled, unconfined, unrestricted, unbound,
unafflicted, expansive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suitability for work: e.g.: gentle, soft, light, at ease, adroit,
supple, robust, upright, not frail, unbiased, not crooked,
non-deviating, not distorted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peace: e.g.: relaxed, calm, content, not stressed, not lacking, not
hankering, not agitated, untroubled, undisturbed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When one is familiar with the attributes of a healthy, unblemished mind,
one can examine those qualities that are defined as either wholesome or
unwholesome. How do wholesome qualities support and strengthen the mind,
and how to unwholesome qualities plague and spoil, weaken and afflict
the mind? {249}</p>
<p>Here are examples of wholesome qualities: <em>sati</em>: mindfulness, the
ability to sustain attention; <em>mettā</em>: lovingkindness, goodwill, the
wish for others to be happy; <em>alobha</em>: non-greed, absence of craving,
the inclination to be generous; <em>paññā</em>: wisdom, penetrative insight;
<em>passaddhi</em>: tranquillity, physical repose and mental calm, an absence
of stress and restlessness; <em>kusala-chanda</em>: wholesome enthusiasm, love
of goodness, aspiration for truth, a wish to harmonize with causes and
conditions; <em>muditā</em>: delight and rejoicing when others succeed or are
happy.</p>
<p>Here are examples of unwholesome qualities: <em>kāma-chanda</em>: greed,
covetousness, hankering (see
Note <a href="#note-two-desires">Wholesome and Unwholesome Desire</a>); <em>byāpāda</em>: ill-will, indignation,
resentment; <em>thīna-middha</em>: despondency, discouragement, apathy,
listlessness, lethargy; <em>uddhacca-kukkucca</em>: restlessness, mental
agitation, mental disturbance, moodiness, worry, anxiety; <em>vicikicchā</em>:
doubt, indecisiveness; <em>kodha</em>: anger; <em>issā</em>: envy; <em>macchariya</em>:
stinginess, jealousy, a wish to obstruct others.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Wholesome and Unwholesome Desire</span><a id="note-two-desires"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between <em>kusala-chanda</em> and <em>kāma-chanda</em> (or <em>lobha</em>)
is discussed at length in chapter 10 on desire and motivation. In
brief, greed (<em>lobha</em>) is an attachment to sense objects that offer
instant gratification, but do not lead anywhere beyond this. Greed
focuses on indulging in sense objects and it reinforces a sense of
self, which acquires or consumes these objects. Wholesome enthusiasm
(<em>chanda</em>), on the other hand, takes hold of things that are in a
beginning stage of development. The mind embraces and harmonizes with
things, assisting them to reach completion. It does not involve a wish
for personal gratification, nor does it lead to a sense of an isolated
self that acquires or consumes things.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When one is endowed with lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>), the mind is happy,
peaceful, and expansive. Kindness supports and strengthens the mind. And
mindfulness helps to sustain attention on those things with which one is
engaged. It is aware of appropriate action in specific circumstances,
wards against unwholesome qualities, and prepares the mind for work.
These two qualities are thus classified as wholesome.</p>
<p>Jealousy constricts, agitates, and oppresses the mind; it clearly
weakens and impairs the mind. Anger burns from within, causing mental
distress, and it can quickly damage one’s physical health. Craving, or
just ordinary greed, entangles, distorts, and beclouds the mind, making
it fretful and anxious. These qualities are thus unwholesome.</p>
<p>Although despondency, apathy, listlessness, and restlessness, etc., are
unwholesome, in English it is not fully accurate to say that these
qualities are ’bad’. Similarly, some wholesome qualities like
tranquillity are not necessarily referred to as ’good’. This
demonstrates how the terms ’wholesome’ and ’unwholesome’ are not
identical to the terms ’good’ and ’bad’.</p>
<p>By understanding the meanings of <em>kusala</em> and <em>akusala</em>, one also gains
an understanding of good kamma and bad kamma, that is, of wholesome
kamma (<em>kusala-kamma</em>) and unwholesome kamma (<em>akusala-kamma</em>).</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, intention (<em>cetanā</em>) is the essential factor for
volitional action (<em>kamma</em>). Therefore, wholesome intentions
(<em>kusala-cetanā</em>) are defined as wholesome kamma, and unwholesome
intentions (<em>akusala-cetanā</em>) are defined as unwholesome kamma.</p>
<p>When wholesome and unwholesome intentions are expressed by way of body,
speech, or mind, they are referred to as wholesome and unwholesome
physical actions (<em>kāya-kamma</em>), verbal actions (<em>vacī-kamma</em>), and
mental actions (<em>mano-kamma</em>), respectively. {250}</p>

<h4 id="the-wholesome-and-the-unwholesome-can-be-interconnected"><a class="header" href="#the-wholesome-and-the-unwholesome-can-be-interconnected">The Wholesome and the Unwholesome Can Be Interconnected</a></h4>
<p>Some people are endowed with faith, practise generosity, keep moral
precepts, or possess aspects of wisdom, all of which are wholesome
qualities or activities, yet they become conceited or arrogant as a
consequence of this virtuous behaviour. Conceit and arrogance are
unwholesome qualities. This is an example of the wholesome acting as a
condition for the unwholesome.</p>
<p>Some people develop concentration and attain the jhānas, yet become
captivated by these refined states. Some people develop lovingkindness
and goodwill, yet when they encounter an attractive sense object, their
love facilitates the arising of lust, which may then be followed by
other unwholesome qualities like prejudice. These are more examples of
the wholesome acting as a condition for the unwholesome.</p>
<p>Faith is a wholesome quality, uplifting and focusing the mind. But if
one relates to faith unskilfully, it may lead to wrong view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>)
and conceit (<em>māna</em>). One is convinced that one’s own views are correct,
while others’ views are false, which may be a cause for quarrelling,
disputing, and abuse. This too is an example of the wholesome acting as
a condition for the unwholesome.</p>
<p>Some people long to be born in heaven and thus determine to act
virtuously. Some yearn for peace and thus practise concentration until
they reach the concentrative attainments. Some children wish to be
admired by adults and thus try to behave in a well-disciplined way. Some
students desire good grades and thus strive to study and seek
knowledge.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn28-1"><a href="#fn-fn28">28</a></sup> Some people feel the burning influence of anger, which
then leads them to clearly understand the harmful effects of anger. Some
people become offended by an adversary, yet this experience leads them
to feel compassion for others. Others may feel anxious or depressed and
as a result they gain faith in the Dhamma. These are examples of the
unwholesome acting as a condition for the wholesome.</p>
<p>A teenager is warned by his parents to take great care over whom he
associates with, but he does not listen. Later, he is duped by a bad
character into drug addiction. When he is aware of what has happened, he
is both angry at himself and depressed. He understands his parents’
warning and is deeply moved by their care for him (the unwholesome
conditioning the wholesome), which in turn makes him even more angry at
himself (the wholesome conditioning the unwholesome).</p>
<p>During this exchange between the wholesome and the unwholesome, when
wholesome qualities are present the mind is in a state of wellbeing,
while when unwholesome qualities are present the mind is impaired. The
wholesome and the unwholesome may alternate rapidly, and for this reason
it is important to distinguish between different mind moments.</p>
<h4 id="good-and-evil-and-the-wholesome-and-the-unwholesome"><a class="header" href="#good-and-evil-and-the-wholesome-and-the-unwholesome">Good and Evil, and the Wholesome and the Unwholesome</a></h4>
<p>In some cases these two pairs of terms – <em>puñña</em> and <em>pāpa</em> and <em>kusala</em>
and <em>akusala</em> – can be used interchangeably, while in other cases they
cannot. The distinction between these terms can thus cause confusion.
Here, only a brief explanation of this distinction is given. {251}</p>
<p>In a literal sense, the term <em>puñña</em> (’merit’, ’goodness’) is defined in
two ways: factors for purifying the underlying disposition of mind, and
factors leading to the fruition of a meritorious state of existence.
Other definitions include: factors leading to holiness, and factors
bringing one’s wishes to fulfilment.</p>
<p>The term <em>pāpa</em> is literally defined as factors leading to the round of
suffering (<em>vaṭṭa-dukkha</em>), or factors leading to a bad destination
(<em>duggati</em>). Common definitions for <em>pāpa</em> include ’filthy’, ’indecent’,
’wicked’, ’evil’, and ’base’. Occasionally, <em>pāpa</em> is used as a
qualifying adjective for the fruit of volitional action (<em>vipāka</em>); in
this context it means ’miserable’ (<em>dukkha</em>) or ’undesirable’
(<em>aniṭṭha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn29-1"><a href="#fn-fn29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>Note that these definitions have been established by linguists and only
reveal certain aspects of the meanings of these terms. It is essential
to also understand their true meanings within the context of Dhamma
teachings.</p>
<p>In the broadest sense, <em>puñña</em> is equivalent to <em>kusala</em>, and <em>pāpa</em> is
equivalent to <em>akusala</em>. Yet in the actual application of these terms,
<em>puñña</em> and <em>pāpa</em> are normally used in a more restricted sense than
<em>kusala</em> and <em>akusala</em>.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, <em>pāpa</em> is used as an equivalent for <em>akusala</em> more
often than <em>puñña</em> is used as an equivalent for <em>kusala</em>. The reverse
scenario, however, of <em>kusala</em> being used as an equivalent for <em>puñña</em>,
is common.</p>
<p>An important instance of <em>pāpa</em> being used as an equivalent for
<em>akusala</em> is in the first and second factors in the teaching of the four
right efforts (<em>sammappadhāna</em>), in which these two terms are used in
conjunction: one strives to protect against unarisen ’evil unwholesome’
(<em>pāpa-akusala</em>) qualities, and one strives to abandon those evil
unwholesome qualities already arisen. In the third and fourth factors,
however, <em>puñña</em> is not used together with <em>kusala</em>. Here only <em>kusala</em>
is mentioned: one strives to cultivate those wholesome qualities not yet
arisen, and one strives to preserve those arisen wholesome factors and
bring them to perfection.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn30-1"><a href="#fn-fn30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>In brief, the definitions of <em>puñña</em> and <em>kusala</em> are not identical. If
one divides <em>kusala</em> into two levels, as mundane wholesomeness
(<em>lokiya-kusala</em>) and transcendent wholesomeness (<em>lokuttara-kusala</em>),
the term <em>puñña</em> applies to the former. In the case that <em>puñña</em> refers
to transcendent wholesomeness, a modifier is added, for example:
<em>lokuttara-puñña</em> (’transcendent goodness’). This term, however, is
uncommon (it is only found in one passage of the commentaries, along
with the corresponding passage in the sub-commentaries.)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn31-1"><a href="#fn-fn31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Pali Canon, the Buddha frequently mentions the term
<em>opadhika-puñña</em>: ’merit yielding fruit as the five aggregates’, which
is a form of mundane goodness. This implies that the term
<em>anopadhika-puñña</em> (or <em>nirūpadhi-puñña</em>) – ’transcendent goodness’ –
should appear as a pair, but these two terms do not appear anywhere in
the scriptures.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn32-1"><a href="#fn-fn32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Instead, in one sutta of the Pali Canon one finds the term
<em>nirūpadhi-kusala</em> (’transcendent wholesomeness’) paired with
<em>opadhika-puñña</em> (’mundane goodness’):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>By way of body, speech, and mind, cultivate transcendent, boundless
wholesomeness. Having cultivated mundane goodness through generosity,
[develop the gift of the Dhamma], encouraging others to be
established in the true Dhamma, in the sublime life. {252}</p>
<p><em>It. 77-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Generally speaking, the Buddha used the term <em>puñña</em> in the sense of
mundane goodness (<em>opadhika-puñña</em>). Although the term <em>opadhika</em> is not
added, it is implied. The meaning is thus equivalent to mundane
wholesomeness (<em>lokiya-kusala</em>). <em>Puñña</em> is thus only one part of
<em>kusala</em>, which also encompasses the transcendent. Only very few
commentarial passages fully equate <em>puñña</em> and <em>kusala</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn33-1"><a href="#fn-fn33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentaries explain the various nuances of the term <em>puñña</em>. The
Paramatthadīpanī (the commentary to the Itivuttaka) for instance,
provides five definitions for this term:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn34-1"><a href="#fn-fn34">34</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The fruit derived from wholesome actions, for example in the
passage: ’Due to undertaking various wholesome things, merit
increases.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn35-1"><a href="#fn-fn35">35</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtuous behaviour in the sense sphere (<em>kāmāvacara</em>) and the
fine-material sphere (<em>rūpāvacara</em>), e.g.: ’One is subject to
ignorance if one proliferates over meritorious activities
(<em>puññābhisaṅkhāra</em>).’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn36-1"><a href="#fn-fn36">36</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distinctively happy destinations of birth, e.g.: ’Consciousness
arriving at a state of goodness (<em>puñña</em>).’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn37-1"><a href="#fn-fn37">37</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wholesome intention, for example in the term <em>puññakiriyā-vatthu</em>
(’bases of meritorious action’; this is equivalent to wholesome
action – <em>kusala-kamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn38-1"><a href="#fn-fn38">38</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wholesome actions in the three planes of existence, e.g.: ’Bhikkhus,
do not fear goodness (<em>puñña</em>).’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn39-1"><a href="#fn-fn39">39</a></sup> (This is equivalent to mundane
wholesomeness.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The fifth definition is the principal one, corresponding to the
explanation in the Mahāniddesa:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever wholesome formation (kusalābhisaṅkhāra) in the three states
of being (dhātu: kāma-dhātu, rūpa-dhātu, and arūpa-dhātu) is called
’goodness’ (puñña). All unwholesomeness is called ’non-goodness’
(apuñña = pāpa – ’evil’).</p>
<p><em>Nd. I. 90; explaining: Sn. 155; expanded upon at NdA. I. 219; cf.:
Dh. verses 39, 267, 412.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In sum, ’goodness’ (<em>puñña</em>) refers to mundane wholesomeness (<em>kusala</em>);
’evil’ (<em>pāpa</em>) refers to all unwholesomeness (<em>akusala</em>). <em>Kusala</em> is
divided into mundane and transcendent wholesomeness, while <em>akusala</em> is
exclusively mundane. Both goodness (<em>puñña</em>) and evil (<em>pāpa</em>) refer to
mundane phenomena.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn40-1"><a href="#fn-fn40">40</a></sup></p>
<p>These definitions help to understand such phrases as ’free from good and
evil’, ’abandoning good and evil’, and ’rising above good and evil’,
which refer to attributes of an arahant’s mind.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn41-1"><a href="#fn-fn41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>Note that such freedom from good and evil implies a freedom from or an
abandonment of mundane wholesomeness; it does not mean that arahants
have abandoned transcendent wholesomeness. {253}</p>
<p>When the terms <em>puñña</em> and <em>kusala</em> appear in tandem, <em>kusala</em> takes on
the definition of <em>puñña</em>; its meaning is thus narrowed, referring to
mundane wholesomeness.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn42-1"><a href="#fn-fn42">42</a></sup> An important attribute of mundane goodness,
or mundane wholesomeness, is that a person is still concerned with
material or sensual results. The focus here is not deliverance of mind
or on the complete removal of mental defilement.</p>
<p>Here are two examples in the Pali Canon of how these terms are applied:
when a bhikkhu is thinking of giving up the training, he often says that
he will disrobe in order to spend wealth and make merit;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn43-1"><a href="#fn-fn43">43</a></sup> and a
virtuous householder’s life is marked by spending wealth and making
merit.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn44-1"><a href="#fn-fn44">44</a></sup> The term ’merit’ here refers to various virtuous actions,
like being charitable, offering gifts, upholding moral standards, etc.,
corresponding to the term ’wholesome action’ (<em>kusala-kamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn45-1"><a href="#fn-fn45">45</a></sup> The
same meaning applies in the passage: ’Merit is favourable for devas, for
human beings, and for renunciants.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn46-1"><a href="#fn-fn46">46</a></sup> In the Buddha’s statement that
’merit is a name for happiness’, <em>puñña</em> here refers to the desirable
fruits of wholesome actions.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn47-1"><a href="#fn-fn47">47</a></sup> The expression ’death due to the end
of merit’ (<em>puññakhaya-maraṇa</em>) refers to having used up the fruits of
meritorious actions which conditioned that particular birth.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn48-1"><a href="#fn-fn48">48</a></sup></p>
<p>In a similar vein, the definition of the term <em>dhamma</em>, whereby it
corresponds to the term <em>puñña</em>, is related to going to heaven, just
like the term <em>adhamma</em>, corresponding to <em>pāpa</em>, is related to going to
hell.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn49-1"><a href="#fn-fn49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>Although <em>puñña</em> and <em>kusala</em> are synonyms, in the general application
of these terms, the meaning of <em>kusala</em> is broader than the meaning of
<em>puñña</em>. These terms can be used interchangeably in some contexts, but
not in others. The definitions of <em>pāpa</em> and <em>akusala</em> are closer to one
another, and thus these two terms are more frequently used
interchangeably. They are most often used to portray attributes in
opposition to <em>puñña</em>. Here are a few more points pertaining to these
terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The term <em>kusala</em> may be used in reference to intentional actions
(<em>kamma</em>) or in reference to natural phenomena. <em>Puñña</em>, on the
other hand, is usually used only in reference to intentional
actions. The terms ’wholesome action’ (<em>kusala-kamma</em>) and
’wholesome state’ (<em>kusala-dhamma</em>) are common. The term
’meritorious action’ (<em>puñña-kamma</em>) is also found, but the term
’meritorious state’ (<em>puñña-dhamma</em>) sounds unusual and does not
appear to be used in Dhamma teachings. The terms ’unwholesome
action’ (<em>akusala-kamma</em>), ’unwholesome state’ (<em>akusala-dhamma</em>),
’evil action’ (<em>pāpa-kamma</em>), and ’evil state’ (<em>pāpa-dhamma</em>) are
all found in the scriptures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In special circumstances, <em>puñña</em> refers to the fruit of wholesome
actions. Even in those cases where it does not refer to the fruit of
goodness directly, <em>puñña</em> is used in relation to the effects of
actions, or it seems to focus on external or sensual rewards, in
particular to happiness and to being born in good destinations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For these reasons, <em>puñña</em> is usually only used in reference to
mundane goodness and wholesomeness. It is very rare that this term
is used to encompass the meaning of transcendent wholesomeness.
{254}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are two more points that may be of interest to scholars:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The terms <em>puñña</em> and <em>pāpa</em> were commonly used before the Buddha’s
time, and their meanings were tied up with the concepts of fate and
the sacred. The Buddha used these terms to the extent that they fit
with Buddhist principles. The terms <em>kusala</em> and <em>akusala</em> were also
used before the Buddha’s time, but in the sense of ’skilled’,
’clever’, ’proficient’, ’easeful’, or ’healthy’ (and the opposite
meanings). The Buddha used these terms, but defined them to
correspond with desired nuances of meaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For this reason, the terms <em>kusala</em> and <em>akusala</em> have truly
Buddhist connotations, and are used in a technical sense. In
contrast, the Buddha tended to use the terms <em>puñña</em> and <em>pāpa</em> when
teaching householders and when referring to everyday life.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn50-1"><a href="#fn-fn50">50</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="criteria-for-good-and-bad-action"><a class="header" href="#criteria-for-good-and-bad-action">Criteria for Good and Bad Action</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier the law of kamma (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>) is most closely
linked to psychological laws (<em>citta-niyāma</em>) and to conventional laws
(<em>sammati-niyāma</em>). This close relationship between the three can cause
confusion for people. Therefore, in order to clearly understand the
subject of kamma, and of good and evil, it is important to distinguish
the boundaries between these three laws.</p>
<p>The law of kamma overlaps psychological laws, yet there is also a clear
point of separation. Intention (<em>cetanā</em>), which is the essence and
primary agent within the law of kamma, makes this law independent from
other laws, or it provides people with a role independent of other laws.
Intention enables a personal sphere of deliberation and design, to the
extent that people claim to be equal to or to compete with nature, and
distinguish their own world of creations from the domain of nature.</p>
<p>Intention relies on the mechanisms of psychological laws<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn51-1"><a href="#fn-fn51">51</a></sup> in order
to function, and when a person performs intentional actions, the
fruition of these actions rely on psychological laws in order to be
maintained. This is similar to someone driving a motorboat. The driver
is like intention, which pertains to the law of kamma. The boat’s engine
is like the mechanisms and various factors of the mind, which pertain to
psychological laws. The driver must rely on the engine, but the
direction which the boat (i.e. a person’s life along with his or her
body) goes, is determined by the driver. The driver relies on and
derives benefit from the engine, yet he is ultimately responsible for
where the boat goes. This is similar to how the law of kamma relies on
and derives benefit from psychological laws. Intentional action,
however, is responsible for the direction life goes, including the
consequences one’s decisions have for the mind and body.</p>
<p>The relationship between the law of kamma and psychological laws
generally causes no problems, because people tend not to give it much
attention. Regardless of the level of interest people have in it, or
even whether people are aware of it or not, this relationship functions
automatically, generally out of sight from people.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the relationship between the law of kamma and
conventional laws causes much confusion for people. Many people have
doubts about good and evil; they question what is good and evil, what is
the true validity behind marking an action as good or evil, and what are
the criteria for determining good and evil. {255}</p>
<p>Many people claim that good and evil are concepts exclusively determined
and assigned by people and by society. The same action may be labelled
good in one society or by one generation, but labelled bad in another
society or at another point in history. The same action may be endorsed
by one society and forbidden by another. For example, some tribal
cultures may decree that killing members of another tribe is good, while
more developed cultures will recognize that the killing of all human
beings is wrong. Some religions teach that killing animals for food is
blameless, while other religions teach that injuring any living creature
is unskilful. Some cultures say that it is good for a woman to have
several husbands, while others say that a woman should have only one –
they may even prescribe that a woman should jump into her husband’s
funeral pyre. Some societies declare that children should honour and
obey their elders, without dispute, while others declare that mutual
respect and honour is independent of age and that everyone should engage
in reasoned debate.</p>
<p>The claim that concepts of good and evil are conventional designations
created by people and by society is largely true. Having said this, such
conventional designations have no bearing on the law of kamma, and one
should be careful not to confuse the two.</p>
<p>Conventional designations of good and evil pertain to conventional laws
(<em>sammati-niyāma</em>). They are distinct from matters of good and evil
(matters of wholesomeness and unwholesomeness) pertaining to the law of
kamma (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>). Although these two laws are related, they have a
clear point of separation. Confusion arises because people are often
unable to distinguish between the two.</p>
<p>The factor that acts as a bridge between these two laws, and also acts
to separate them, is the same as the distinguishing factor between the
law of kamma and psychological laws, i.e. intention (<em>cetanā</em>). This
will be examined in more detail, below.</p>
<p>In relation to the law of kamma, there are several important aspects to
social prescriptions:</p>
<p>Social prescriptions are not directly connected to the wholesome and
unwholesome as dictated by the law of kamma. They are established by
society for a particular objective, say for social harmony and peace.
They manifest as a form of mutual agreement or commitment. These
prescriptions may lead to social peace and wellbeing or they may not;
they may be beneficial or even harmful. This depends on how
comprehensive the knowledge is of those who enact these prescriptions,
or on these people’s level of sincerity. These prescriptions come in
many forms, from various customs and traditions, up to a body of laws.</p>
<p>Here, good and evil is determined by these conventional laws
(<em>sammati-niyāma</em>). The concepts of good and evil in this case are
varied and variable. Their variation and changeability, however, do not
pertain to the law of kamma (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>). The two sets of laws
should not be confused. When someone transgresses these prescriptions,
this is a matter pertaining to conventional laws, not to the law of
kamma. {256}</p>
<p>Now we can examine how these social conventions enter into the domain of
the law of kamma. When someone accepts these prescriptions, regardless
of whether these prescriptions are virtuous and beneficial or not, yet
he or she decides to disobey them, at that moment there is an intention
to disobey or to transgress them.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn52-1"><a href="#fn-fn52">52</a></sup> Moreover, the person will be
aware of these intentions, without being able to ignore or deny them.</p>
<p>Intention here is connected directly to the law of kamma. Some societies
may try to include the factor of intention when passing judgement on
people, in order to determine whether the infringement of a law was
performed intentionally or not. But this is still a matter pertaining to
social conventions; it simply indicates that this society is intelligent
and knows how to benefit from the law of kamma.</p>
<p>In terms of the law of kamma, regardless of whether a society examines
whether a person acted intentionally or not, or whether it determines if
a law has been transgressed or not, the kammic process has begun the
moment a person has an intention to infringe on a socially accepted
prescription and acts upon this intention. The process of bearing kammic
fruit (<em>vipāka</em>) has been set in motion, and the person begins to
experience the results of his or her volitional actions.</p>
<p>The goodness or badness of an action in such a case must be considered
from the perspective of conventional laws. It is not directly related to
the law of kamma (it is linked to the law of kamma when one takes into
account the intention and level of wisdom of those people who have
enacted these prescriptions.) In regard to observing and upholding these
prescriptions, the law of kamma is only related in the area of
acknowledging and accepting these socially prescribed terms, and then
acting intentionally, in some way or another, in response to them.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the dynamics discussed so far are part of virtuous
conduct (<em>sīla</em>). They reveal the connection between human laws and the
laws of nature, which must be clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>There are situations where conventional designations of good and bad are
indirectly related to the law of kamma. For example, a society may
prescribe a particular action as good and correct, to be observed by
everyone. Later, someone endowed with wisdom recognizes that in fact
this action is neither good nor beneficial, and may even be harmful to
society. That person may try to explain this to other members of
society, try to revise their ways of conduct, and perhaps even refuse to
observe this custom.</p>
<p>In such a circumstance, the person’s actions do not spring from defiled
intention, as is the case for someone who breaks a law for unwholesome
reasons. Instead, it springs from intention accompanied by wisdom,
aiming to improve the wellbeing of others. The gist of the kammic
process in these individual cases is not the same, as it depends on the
quality of intention.</p>
<p>In any case, whatever the quality of intention, the perpetrator of such
an act is aware of the specific intention and must receive the fruit of
it according to the law of kamma. He may be able to hide from or deceive
society, but he cannot hide from his own mind, nor can he deceive the
laws of nature. In a nutshell, the determining factor in regard to the
law of kamma is whether intention is wholesome or unwholesome. {257}</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there is no transgression, or intent to transgress,
when society agrees unanimously to repeal or amend a law or
prescription. In such a case, the transgressor has not compromised his
integrity or betrayed a social contract.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated by some simple examples. Imagine two people live
together. In order for both people to live at ease, they lay down
certain regulations. Say they work at different locations and return
home at different times, but they agree to eat supper together. They
cannot wait for the other person forever, so they each agree not to eat
supper alone before seven in the evening. One of them likes cats and
dislikes dogs; the other likes dogs and dislikes cats. They therefore
agree not to have any pets in the house.</p>
<p>If either of them decides not to honour one of these agreements, the
intention to breach it arises and things proceed according to the law of
kamma. This is so even though, in truth, eating before seven in the
evening or bringing a pet into the house is neither inherently good nor
bad. Another two people may lay down an opposite set of regulations. If
one of the two persons recognizes that the regulations in fact are
unconducive to their communal wellbeing, they must discuss whether to
revoke or to change them. Neglecting to follow these regulations then
does not entail an intention to transgress them.</p>
<p>The Vinaya – the monastic set of training rules – is linked to
intention as part of a person’s conduct, culminating in his or her moral
integrity (<em>sīla</em>). Here one can see both the relationship and the
distinction between uncertain, indefinite matters of good and evil, of
right and wrong, prescribed by a society, and certain, definite matters
of wholesomeness and unwholesomeness pertaining to the law of kamma.</p>
<p>There exists a relationship between social prescriptions and the law of
kamma. Having said this, regardless of whether a society defines good
and evil with an understanding of what is truly wholesome and
unwholesome – of what is favourable and what is harmful to people – or
whether it lacks this understanding, the dynamics of the law of kamma
proceed naturally, unaltered by the social prescriptions.</p>
<p>A society may endorse the taking of intoxicants, believing that they
make people happy; it may advocate violent emotions; it may believe that
one should incite and stimulate people, increasing their desires and
competitiveness, in order for them to be more productive; it may claim
that killing other groups of people is good or that killing animals is
blameless. In such cases, the so-called goodness of social prescriptions
conflicts with wholesomeness within the law of kamma.</p>
<p>From a social perspective, these prescriptions or beliefs may have both
positive and negative consequences. The endorsement of intoxicants, for
example, may greatly increase the state’s income by way of excise tax.
But at the same time many members of society may end up dull and idle,
or debilitated, and crime may be rampant. The belief that people should
be frenetically productive may lead to rapid advancements in the
material wellbeing of society, but it may also lead to an increase in
heart disease, mental illness, suicide, and an abnormal number of other
problems. {258} Similarly, in a society that condones the killing of
other human beings, its members will be viewed by outsiders as cruel and
untrustworthy.</p>
<p>Many of these consequences manifesting in society may also spring from
dynamics within the law of kamma. At beginning stages, however, to avoid
confusion, one should distinguish between results occurring from social
prescriptions and results occurring from the law of kamma. Later, one
can examine how these two dynamics are linked.</p>
<p>In regard to the law of kamma, there are two levels of intention: first,
there is intention accompanied by an adherence to a social prescription,
which manifests for example as beliefs or values; second, there is the
intention to either observe or to disobey a prescription at a particular
moment in time. In any case, the reaping of kammic fruit begins
immediately once one has established an intention.</p>
<p>Take for example a person who revels in drinking alcohol; while
drinking, his intention will be accompanied by a dimwitted form of
delight. If he drinks regularly he will develop this state of mind as an
habitual disposition.</p>
<p>When someone who is frantically vying to obtain things is engaged in
work, his intention will be accompanied by stress and desperation, which
will become habitual features of his mind.</p>
<p>Although someone who is determined to kill others may be praised and
rewarded by his society, at the time of killing his intention is
accompanied by malice and cruelty, or by wild ambition. If he frequently
indulges in such killing, these states of mind may develop to form his
entire personality. The quality of his mind will become coarser and will
lose its refinement, subtlety, and tenderness.</p>
<p>Here, the term <em>cetanā</em> (’intention’) should be inspected more closely.
In the Pali Canon, the meaning of the term <em>cetanā</em> is more subtle and
refined than the meaning of ’intention’ in English. Generally speaking,
the term ’intention’ in English is used when one wishes to link internal
deliberations with external actions. For example, people may say: ’He
had a slip of the tongue; he didn’t intend to say that,’ or ’she acted
intentionally.’ In Dhamma teachings – i.e. according to the principle
of kamma – however, deliberate speech, physical actions, and thoughts,
memories and recollections, and emotional responses to things received
by way of the five senses, no matter how minor or temporary, are all
accompanied by intention.</p>
<p><em>Cetanā</em> thus refers to volition, purpose, and deliberation, to
selecting the objects for attention. Intention is the principal factor
for steering and activating the mind, which then inclines towards or
turns away from things, or pursues a specific direction. It is the
leader, director, and governor of the mind, determining how one relates
to various things. It shapes the course of the mind and in the end it
conditions one’s particular state of mind.</p>
<p>When intention arises, kamma manifests. When kamma manifests, it
produces immediate effects, because with the arising of intention the
mind becomes active – there is mental activity. Even in the case of
minor, fleeting thoughts, which do not bear any significant fruit, they
still have an effect. At the very least they constitute a form of fine
kammic ’dust’ that accumulates in the mind and affects its properties.
When it increases, for instance when the mind resorts to these thoughts
frequently, or when they intensify and are expressed as outward actions,
their effects become more pronounced, developing into a person’s habits
and personality. {259}</p>
<p>Take the example of harmful deeds. One need not examine an action as
dire as killing another person; even damaging something of very little
value, if performed with malicious intent or a mind of anger, say
tearing up a piece of useless paper out of irritation, has an effect on
the quality of the mind. It is not the same as someone tearing up
unneeded paper with an ordinary state of mind.</p>
<p>When one performs a volitional action repeatedly, the effects of this
kammic accumulation become more obvious and may gradually magnify in
scope. This is similar to dust settling in a room, in a way unnoticed by
the person living there. All volitional actions bears some kind of
fruit. Apart from the amount and the potency of the kammic effects
accumulated, the level of their importance is also related to the
specific quality and function of the mind.</p>
<p>There needs to be plenty of dust on a road before it is considered to be
filthy. A lesser amount of dust on the floor of a living room is
considered to be dirty. An amount less than that on the surface of a
desk is considered unclean and may disturb the person working there. A
small amount of dust on a mirror soils it and diminishes its usefulness.
And a minuscule amount of dust on a pair of glasses is noticeable and
blurs one’s vision. A similar analogy is that of using a knife to scrape
a road surface, a floor in a house, or a pair of glasses, respectively.
Reverse similes also apply: compare using a small velvet cloth or wad of
cotton wool to wipe a floor, in contrast to using it to clean a pair of
glasses.</p>
<p>No intentional action is fruitless, which is summed up by these Buddhist
sayings:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>All accumulated deeds, both good and bad, bear fruit. Actions marked
as kamma, even trifling ones, are not void of result.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn53-1"><a href="#fn-fn53">53</a></sup></p>
<p><em>J. IV. 394.</em></p>
<p>Neither good nor bad deeds are performed in vain.</p>
<p><em>J. VI. 239.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>People tend to overlook the importance of the subtle effects of
volitional action at the level of the mind. Here are two more similes to
help clarify this matter:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are many different degrees of clean and dirty water, e.g.:
marsh water, river water, tap water, and distilled water. Marsh
water may be used as a habitat for various creatures, but it is not
suitable for bathing, drinking, or other more refined purposes.
River water is suitable for bathing and for washing cloths, but
perhaps not suitable for drinking. Tap water may be used for
drinking, but not for intravenous injections. For ordinary purposes,
tap water is adequate for people’s overall needs, but if one is
faced with special circumstances it is insufficient.</p>
<p>This is similar to differences in the quality of mind, in terms of
varying degrees of coarseness and subtlety, turbidity and
brightness, due to actions performed and accumulated. During much of
one’s life, one may not feel there is a problem with mediocre or
relatively coarse states of mind, but later on one may be faced with
a situation calling for more refined states of mind. One’s
accumulated actions in the past may cause problems and one’s
habitual state of mind may be inadequate for the circumstances;
indeed, it may even be completely dysfunctional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Water may exist in various degrees of undulation or stillness, e.g.:
surging ocean swells, small waves on a river due to the passing of a
motorboat, a trickling stream, a tranquil pond, and utterly still
water in a vessel. In some cases, one may be able to make use of
undulating water, but in other cases one may need the water to be so
still that one is able to float a needle on the surface. {260}</p>
<p>This is similar to the quality of the mind, either coarse or
refined, which is relevant to one’s specific mental application and
to arriving at exceptional states attainable by human beings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conventional laws (<em>sammati-niyāma</em>) and the law of kamma
(<em>kamma-niyāma</em>) are distinct from one another. The kammic process
follows its own nature, independent of any social prescriptions which
may run counter to it. But because there is a relationship between these
two sets of laws, a person who acts appropriately vis-à-vis the law of
kamma (i.e. adheres to wholesome principles) may face problems from
conflicting social prescriptions. For example, those people who live in
a society that endorses the taking of intoxicants, but wish not to
partake of these themselves, receive some effects from their actions.
Although their clear and bright states of mind are not sullied by
intoxicants, they may be ridiculed by others for being weak or looked
down on in other ways. Even within the domain of kamma, they may
experience difficulties from resisting these social customs and norms,
leading to some degree of conflict in the mind, depending on their level
of wisdom, which dispels any sense of dis-ease.</p>
<p>In a developed and wise society, people draw upon the experiences from
past generations to determine what is truly beneficial to human beings
and what is not. They then establish conventional laws and regulations
dealing with good and evil that are in harmony with principles of
wholesomeness and unwholesomeness conforming to the law of kamma.</p>
<p>This ability to synchronize social prescriptions with kammic principles
is one way of measuring how developed or civilized a particular society
is.</p>
<p>In this sense, when one evaluates the merits of social prescriptions
having to do with good and evil, one may look at them from two angles:
first, from the perspective of conventional laws, do these prescriptions
lead to the welfare of society; and second, from the perspective of the
law of kamma, are they wholesome and conducive to people’s overall
wellbeing?</p>
<p>Some social prescriptions may have been followed and upheld for
centuries, but are not in fact beneficial, neither from the perspective
of conventional laws nor from the perspective of the law of kamma.
Members of such a society should agree to abolish these prescriptions.
Alternatively, they may need to rely on a wise, pure-hearted, and
compassionate person for encouragement, as was the case when the Buddha
persuaded people to abandon animal sacrifices and do away with the caste
system in India.</p>
<p>When one notices that particular prescriptions are advantageous on a
social level, e.g. they are conducive to material prosperity, yet that
they are incompatible with the principles of wholesomeness according to
the law of kamma, one should remember the following fact: sometimes
people mistake what is essentially unfavourable for society as something
beneficial, that is, they are pleased by a false form of progress, which
is satisfying in the short term but harmful in the long term. Those
things that are truly beneficial should be compatible with the wholesome
principles outlined in the law of kamma.</p>
<p>Those things that are spiritually beneficial to an individual are
generally beneficial to all people. Here, one can make a comparison to
material progress. Most people wish for material prosperity, believing
that an abundance of material things and a surplus of comfort will lead
to the highest good for society. They therefore strive to maximize the
degree of material development. Meanwhile, they often destroy those
modes of existence that are seen as outdated and obstacles to progress.
Eventually, however, they may realize that many of their actions have
been faulty. Although their society may appear to be advanced, many
hazards to physical health and to people’s very existence have been
created, to the extent that if people persist in these new ways of
acting, they may be heading for calamity or annihilation. {261}</p>
<p>Just as one should promote material progress that is not harmful to
people’s physical wellbeing, so too, one should nurture the kind of
social development that is not harmful to people’s spiritual life.</p>
<p>As part of a practical analysis of good and evil, the Buddha first
encouraged people to reflect on the wholesome and the unwholesome as the
essential factor for evaluation. He developed the teaching to include an
awareness of good and evil as it manifests in the mind (i.e. to apply
one’s conscience), and a consideration of the opinions by wise
individuals as a frame of reference. These two factors act as the basis
for moral shame (<em>hiri</em>) and fear of wrongdoing (<em>ottappa</em>). Moreover,
he encouraged people to consider the fruits of their actions as they
affect themselves and others, that is, on an individual and a social
level.</p>
<p>Because some people lack a necessary depth of wisdom and may not
recognize for themselves what is wholesome and unwholesome, the Buddha
encouraged them to consider the opinions of the wise. If they still have
doubt, then they should examine the effects of their own actions, even
as they relate to social conventions. This threefold examination (an
awareness of the wholesome and unwholesome, a consideration of the
opinions by the wise, and an examination of the effects of one’s
actions) leads to a comprehensive analysis.</p>
<p>To sum up, when evaluating what is good and bad kamma, one first takes
intention (<em>cetanā</em>) into consideration to decide if an action
constitutes kamma, and then one may apply the following criteria:</p>
<p><em>A. Principal criteria:</em></p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Measuring the wholesome and the unwholesome:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> To consider whether intention springs from a wholesome root
(<em>kusala-mūla</em>), i.e. non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion,
or whether it springs from an unwholesome root (<em>akusala-mūla</em>),
i.e. greed, hatred, and delusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> To consider whether an action is truly conducive to spiritual
wellbeing or not; is it conducive to mental ease, health, peace,
and clarity? Does it strengthen or impair the mind? Does it help
to increase wholesome qualities and decrease unwholesome
qualities, or vice versa? Moreover, what sort of effect does it
have on one’s personality?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>B. Associated criteria:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Applying one’s conscience, one’s inner sense of right and wrong. One
asks whether by acting in a such a way is one worthy of
self-criticism and does one lose one’s self-respect?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Considering the declarations by wise and knowledgeable individuals.
One asks whether a particular action would be approved by the wise;
would they praise it or condemn it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Considering the attributes and fruits of actions, both in relation
to oneself and others:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Does an action harm or cause distress for oneself or others?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Does an action lead to the welfare or to the suffering of
oneself or others? {262}</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Note that the two sub-factors of criteria 1 above are essentially the
same. They both focus on whether an action is beneficial or harmful to
people’s spiritual life.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the approval and disapproval, and the praise and
criticism, of wise individuals is institutionalized or systematized as
religious, cultural, and legal teachings and prescriptions. Although
some laws and customs do not accord with the opinions of the wise, and
some actions conflicting with established laws and customs may not be
censured by the wise, one may say that these cases are exceptional. It
is the responsibility of wise individuals in society to regularly
investigate these matters. In reference to this process, the Buddha used
the term ’investigated by the wise’ (<em>anuvicca viññū</em>); the wise first
investigate a specific matter and then express their approval or
disapproval.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn54-1"><a href="#fn-fn54">54</a></sup> Having investigated these matters, they amend those
things wrongly practised or prescribed, or those things that have
deviated from their original and correct purpose. The Buddha, for
example, rejected the caste system and the tradition of animal
sacrifices.</p>
<p>There is another set of criteria for determining good and evil (or good
and bad kamma) which takes into account the law of kamma on its own, as
well as the law of kamma in relation to conventional laws. It examines
actions from the perspective of natural laws (the real, inherent value
of actions), as well as from the perspective of values attributed to
actions by human beings. It contains the same principles as the outline
described above, but arranges them in a different way:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A reference to advantages and disadvantages on the level of the
mind: one considers whether an action is supportive or unsupportive
to a person’s spiritual life, whether it enhances a person’s quality
of life, whether it strengthens or impairs the mind, whether it
leads to the increase or decrease of wholesome and unwholesome
qualities, and whether it leads to a positive development of a
person’s personality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reference to advantages and disadvantages on the level of the
individual: one considers whether an action causes distress or harm
to oneself, and whether it damages or promotes true inner
wellbeing.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn55-1"><a href="#fn-fn55">55</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reference to advantages and disadvantages on the level of society:
one considers whether an action causes distress or harm to others,
whether it damages or promotes the true wellbeing of others or of
society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reference to one’s natural sense of conscience: one considers
actions by applying one’s own sense of right and wrong, by asking
after a deed is completed whether one is open to self-criticism and
self-blame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A reference to social standards: one considers actions according to
religious, cultural, and other social prescriptions (e.g. laws and
edicts). These prescriptions rely on the examination and scrutiny by
wise individuals in a particular society, who help to ensure that
people do not uphold them naively or inadvisedly. These wise
individuals also determine whether to accept or reject these
prescriptions. {263}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="formal-criteria-for-evaluation"><a class="header" href="#formal-criteria-for-evaluation">Formal Criteria for Evaluation</a></h3>
<p>Before moving on to the subject of the fruits of good and bad actions,
here are some quotes from the Pali Canon in reference to the
aforementioned material:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And what are wholesome phenomena? The three wholesome roots, i.e.
non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion; the feeling aggregate, the
perception aggregate, the volitional formation aggregate, and the
consciousness aggregate, which are accompanied by these wholesome
roots; physical actions, verbal actions, and mental actions, which
originate from these wholesome roots: these are wholesome phenomena.</p>
<p>And what are unwholesome phenomena? The three unwholesome roots, i.e.
greed, hatred, and delusion, and all mental defilements based on the
same foundation as these unwholesome roots; the feeling aggregate, the
perception aggregate, the volitional formation aggregate, and the
consciousness aggregate, which are accompanied by these unwholesome
roots; physical actions, verbal actions, and mental actions, which
originate from these unwholesome roots: these are unwholesome
phenomena.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn56-1"><a href="#fn-fn56">56</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Dhs. 180.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>There are two kinds of dangers: revealed dangers and concealed
dangers.</p>
<p>And what are revealed dangers? Lions, tigers, leopards, bears, wolves
… bandits … eye ailments, ear ailments, nose ailments … cold,
heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, urination, contact with wind, sun,
biting flies, and creeping things. These are called revealed dangers.</p>
<p>And what are concealed dangers? Immoral bodily action, verbal action,
and mental action; the hindrance of sensual desire, ill-will, sloth and
torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt; greed, hatred, and delusion;
anger, resentment, disparagement (i.e. invalidating and concealing the
goodness of others), arrogance, conceit, jealousy, miserliness,
deceit, boastfulness, obstinacy, competitiveness, disdain,
infatuation, and heedlessness; all mental defilement, all dishonesty,
all agitation, all craving, all distress, and all unwholesome
thinking. These are called concealed dangers.</p>
<p>On account of what are things called a danger? On account of
domination … on account of leading to decline … on account of
being a dwelling place….</p>
<p>On account of what are things called a danger due to domination? Those
dangers impair, overwhelm, intimidate, tyrannize, oppress, and ravage
that person….</p>
<p>On account of what are things called a danger due to leading to
decline? Those dangers lead to the decline of wholesome qualities….</p>
<p>On account of what are things called a danger due to being a dwelling
place? Those evil unwholesome states arise internally, dependent on
one’s individuality (atta-bhāva),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn57-1"><a href="#fn-fn57">57</a></sup> in the same way as a creature
dependent on a hole lives in a hole, a creature dependent on water
lives in water, a creature dependent on the forest lives in the
forest, a creature dependent on a tree lives in a tree…. {264}</p>
<p>This accords with what the Blessed One said: ’Monks, a monk who has
both students and a teacher dwells in suffering, not in comfort.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn58-1"><a href="#fn-fn58">58</a></sup></p>
<p>And how does a monk who has both students and a teacher dwell in
suffering, not in comfort? When the eye sees a form … the ear hears
a sound … the nose smells an odour … the tongue tastes a flavour
… the body contacts a tangible … the mind cognizes a mental
object, there arise in him evil unwholesome states, covetous thoughts
leading to binding defilements. Evil unwholesome states dwell within
him. For this reason he is called ’one who has students.’ Those evil
unwholesome states provoke him. For this reason he is called ’one who
has a teacher.’</p>
<p>It accords with what the Blessed One said: ’Monks, these three things
are inward stains, inward enemies, inward foes, inward executioners,
inward nemeses. What three? Greed, hatred, and delusion….’</p>
<p>Greed causes harm and agitates the mind. If someone fails to discern
that it is a danger arising internally, greed enters and he recognizes
neither its essence nor its practical significance. When greed
dominates the mind, there is only darkness. Hatred causes harm….
Delusion causes harm … there is only darkness.</p>
<p>It accords with what the Blessed One said: ’There are, great king,
three things which, when they arise within a person, arise for his
harm, suffering, and discomfort. What three? Greed, hatred, and
delusion….</p>
<p>Just as bamboo seeds destroy the bamboo tree, so too greed, hatred,
and delusion arising within destroy an evil-minded person.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn59-1"><a href="#fn-fn59">59</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these three unwholesome roots. What three? The

<p>Greed in itself is unwholesome. Whatever deed a greedy person performs
by body, speech, and mind is also unwholesome. When a greedy person
overcome by greed, whose mind is impaired by greed, inflicts suffering
upon another – by killing, imprisoning, dispossessing, censuring, or
banishing – thinking: ’I am powerful, I am mighty’, that too is
unwholesome. Thus numerous evil unwholesome qualities originate in him
born of greed, caused by greed, arisen from greed, conditioned by
greed. {265}</p>
<p>Hatred in itself is unwholesome. Whatever deed a hateful person
performs by body, speech, and mind is also unwholesome. When a hateful
person, overcome by hate … inflicts suffering upon another … that
too is unwholesome. Thus numerous evil unwholesome qualities originate
in him born of hate, caused by hate, arisen from hate, conditioned by
hate.</p>
<p>Delusion itself is unwholesome. Whatever deed a deluded person
performs by body, speech, and mind is also unwholesome. When a deluded
person, overcome by delusion … inflicts suffering upon another …
that too is unwholesome. Thus numerous evil unwholesome qualities
originate in him born of delusion, caused by delusion, arisen from
delusion, conditioned by delusion….</p>
<p>Such a person, overcome by evil unwholesome qualities born of greed
… born of hate … born of delusion, with his mind impaired by them,
dwells in suffering in this very life, with distress, anguish, and
fever, and with the breakup of the body, after death, a bad
destination can be expected for him.</p>
<p>Suppose a sal, myrtle, or kusum tree was choked and enveloped by three
māluvā creepers. It would meet with decline, decay, destruction and
disaster. So too, such a person overcome by bad unwholesome qualities
born of greed … born of hatred … born of delusion … dwells in
suffering in this very life … and with the breakup of the body,
after death, a bad destination can be expected for him….</p>

<p>The following sutta passage contains a question and answer session
between King Pasenadi of Kosala and Ven. Ānanda on the meaning of good
and evil. Here, Ānanda links the various criteria mentioned above:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’Venerable sir, we do not recognize anything of value in the praise
and blame of others spoken by foolish ignorant persons, who speak
without having investigated and evaluated; but we recognize as
valuable the praise and blame of others spoken by wise, intelligent,
and sagacious persons, who speak after having investigated and
evaluated.</p>
<p>’Now, venerable Ānanda, what kind of bodily behaviour … verbal
behaviour … mental behaviour is censured by wise recluses and
brahmins?’</p>
<p>’Any bodily … verbal … mental behaviour that is unwholesome, great

<p>’Now what kind of bodily … verbal … mental behaviour leads to

<p>’Any bodily … verbal … mental behaviour that leads to one’s own
affliction, or to the affliction of others, or to the affliction of
both, and on account of which unwholesome states increase and
wholesome states diminish. Precisely such bodily … verbal … mental
behaviour is censured by wise recluses and brahmins, great king….’</p>
<p>Ven. Ānanda then replies to questions pertaining to the wholesome,
ending with this passage:</p>
<p>’Any bodily … verbal … mental behaviour that does not lead to
one’s own affliction, or to the affliction of others, or to the
affliction of both, and on account of which unwholesome states
diminish and wholesome states increase. Precisely such bodily …

<p>One inflamed by lust, overcome by lust, with mind enthralled by it,
intends for his own affliction, for the affliction of others, and for
the affliction of both, and he experiences mental anguish and
suffering. But when lust is abandoned, he does not intend for his own
affliction, for the affliction of others, or for the affliction of
both, and he does not experience mental anguish and suffering.</p>
<p>One inflamed by lust, overcome by lust, with mind enthralled by it,
engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when lust is
abandoned, one does not engage in misconduct by body, speech, or mind.
One inflamed by lust, overcome by lust, with mind enthralled by it,
does not understand as it really is his own good, the good of others,
or the good of both. But when lust is abandoned one understands as it
really is one’s own good, the good of others, and the good of both.</p>
<p>One full of hate, overcome by hate…. One deluded, overcome by
delusion … experiences mental anguish and suffering…. But when
delusion is abandoned one understands as it really is one’s own good,

<h2 id="fruition-of-kamma"><a class="header" href="#fruition-of-kamma">Fruition of Kamma</a></h2>
<h3 id="levels-of-fruition"><a class="header" href="#levels-of-fruition">Levels of Fruition</a></h3>
<p>The most frequently debated subject in regard to kamma pertains to the
fruits of kamma. In particular, many people doubt the validity of the
principle stating: ’Do good, reap good; do evil, reap evil.’ They gather
evidence demonstrating how in real life many people who perform bad
actions acquire good things, and many people who perform good actions
receive bad things.</p>
<p>These doubts arise due to a confusion between the law of kamma
(<em>kamma-niyāma</em>) and conventional laws (<em>sammati-niyāma</em>), whereby these
two laws become mixed up. People often fail to distinguish between the
boundaries or various stages of these two laws. Even the terms contained
in this aforementioned principle are not clearly understood. Instead of
understanding the phrase ’do good, reap good’ as equivalent to
’practising goodness one obtains goodness’, ’practising goodness one is
endowed with goodness’, ’practising goodness gives rise to goodness’, or
’practising goodness leads to wholesome fruits according to the law of
kamma’, people interpret it as ’by practising goodness one acquires
favourable objects, personal advantages, or gratifying material things’.</p>
<p>To help clarify this matter, consider the following four levels at which
kamma bears fruit:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The level of the mind: here one considers how actions affect the
mind, by the accumulation of wholesome and unwholesome attributes,
and the accumulation of strengths and capabilities; one considers
how actions shape a person’s thoughts and feelings, tendencies,
preferences, joys and sorrows, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The level of personality: here one considers how actions establish a
person’s habitual disposition, and how they determine behaviour,
attitudes, ability to adapt to various circumstances, reactions, and
general interactions with other people and the surrounding
environment. This level is connected to the level of the mind, but
is distinguished to highlight specific aspects of fruition. {270}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The level of a person’s general state of life: here one considers
how actions influence a person’s life, i.e. how they lead to
satisfactory and unsatisfactory experiences, to various rewards and
compensations from outside, to progress and decline, to success and
failure, to various forms of gain like material possessions,
prestige, praise, and pleasure, and to corresponding forms of
loss.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn65-1"><a href="#fn-fn65">65</a></sup> These results can be subdivided into two kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Results from non-human factors in one’s environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Results stemming from other people and society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The level of society: here one considers how people’s actions affect
society, for example how they lead to social progress or decline,
and to collective wellbeing or distress. Moreover, one considers the
effects people’s actions have on the natural environment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two levels pertain primarily to the law of kamma
(<em>kamma-niyāma</em>). Level three involves a relationship between the law of
kamma and conventional laws (<em>sammati-niyāma</em>), which often causes
confusion for people. The fourth level, despite being important, lies
outside of the domain of the present subject matter at hand.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when people look at the fruits of their own actions,
or when they examine the validity of whether other people truly do good
and receive good, do bad and receive bad, they limit their inspection to
the third level, that is, they focus on external rewards. By doing this,
they overlook the results connected to the first and second levels,
although these are of vital importance. They are important in and of
themselves, e.g. the factors of happiness and unhappiness, mental
strengths and weaknesses, mental capabilities, and the proficiency or
deficiency of spiritual faculties, and they are also important as a key
source for the results pertaining to the third level, influencing one’s
general state of life.</p>
<p>Results at levels one and two (the mind and the personality) mutually
reinforce one another, and they go on to influence how one lives one’s
life (level three). Aspects of the third level belonging to the sphere
of the law of kamma (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>) are linked to the results of the
first and second levels – to one’s overall state of mind – including
one’s interests, preferences, and proclivities. The way one pursues
happiness or vents frustration, for instance, which is connected to the
level of the mind, influences how one perceives and responds to things,
how one experiences things, and how one acts and lives one’s life.</p>
<p>In this context, one should examine in what manner people perform
particular deeds. Do they follow through with and complete the action?
How many obstructions are they willing to face? Are they meticulous or
careless, disciplined or slack? Furthermore, how do their actions affect
other people’s thoughts and feelings, which may rebound and affect them
in turn, say by receiving cooperation or by facing opposition. One’s
personality influences how other people play a part in one’s obtaining
either satisfactory or unsatisfactory results.</p>
<p>This is not to deny other factors in the process, in particular those
conditions in one’s social environment that are linked to the law of
kamma and determine one’s state of wellbeing. Here in this chapter,
however, the focus is on kamma as it pertains to a person’s inner life.
A wider perspective is outlined in the following chapters on external
influences and virtuous friendship.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn66-1"><a href="#fn-fn66">66</a></sup> {271}</p>
<p>The preceding teachings on the law of kamma aim to help people improve
themselves within the domain of personal actions. Moreover, besides
improving oneself, one can guide other people to aspire towards
goodness, by providing a wholesome environment according to the
principles of a favourable environment (<em>paṭirūpadesavāsa</em>), virtuous
friendship (<em>kalyāṇamittatā</em>), and association with good people
(<em>sappurisūpassaya</em>).</p>
<p>For the most part, the fruits of kamma manifesting on the third level
(one’s way of life) are connected to the mind and personality. Those
people who love their work, are honest and diligent, and manage their
work well, will generally receive positive fruits of their labour, at
least more than those who are lazy or dishonest. Honest and virtuous
civil servants, who are capable and eager to fulfil the terms of their
office, will generally advance in their profession, better than those
who are incapable or half-hearted. Yet sometimes this is not the case,
because results at this third level are not exclusively generated by the
law of kamma. Factors from other laws and standards, in particular
conventional laws, are involved.</p>
<p>An inability to recognize the involvement by these other factors and to
distinguish between the relative boundaries of these various laws leads
to confusion. Related to this discussion is the phrase: ’Do good,
receive bad; do bad, receive good.’ If the law of kamma operates solely
on its own, there is no problem; the results accord directly with the
actions. If one earnestly reads a book, one will receive knowledge. But
sometimes the body may be fatigued, one has a headache, or the
temperature is too hot, and one cannot finish the reading assignment or
one does not assimilate what one reads. Or perhaps there may arise some
kind of mishap and one is interrupted.</p>
<p>In any case, one should remember that for human beings the law of kamma
is the essential guiding factor in determining positive and negative
results in their lives.</p>
<p>Even before clearly examining the various related causes and conditions,
someone who is disappointed may reflect that had one not done these good
deeds, things may have turned out much worse. Similarly, if others do
good yet do not immediately receive positive results, one can reflect
that had they not acted well they may have fallen into hard times. By
reflecting in this way, one gains an understanding that no volitional
actions are fruitless, and many of them produce profound effects on
one’s state of mind and personality.</p>
<p>The common expression, ’Do good, receive good; do bad, receive bad’, is
derived from the following Buddhist proverb:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn67-1"><a href="#fn-fn67">67</a></sup></p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever sort of seed is sown,<br />
That is the sort of fruit one reaps:<br />
The doer of good reaps good;<br />
The doer of evil reaps evil.</p>
<p><em>Yādisaṁ vapate bījaṁ<br />
Tādisaṁ labhate phalaṁ<br />
Kalyāṇakārī kalyānaṁ<br />
Pāpakārī pāpakaṁ.</em> {272}</p>
<p><em>S. I. 227; J. II. 202; J. III. 158;</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Here, the Buddha quotes verses by previous rishis and bodhisattas, and
assimilates them into the Tipiṭaka. These verses may be considered a
clear and concise description of the Buddhist principle of kamma.</p>
<p>Note how the first pair of verses applies biological laws
(<em>bīja-niyāma</em>) for comparison. This observation helps one to
distinguish between the law of kamma and conventional laws. According to
the laws of botany, the fruit is directly related to the seed. If one
plants tamarind, one gets tamarind; if one plants grapes, one gets
grapes; if one plants cabbage, one gets cabbage. There is no reference
here to conventional laws. There is no mentioning of planting tamarinds
and getting money, or planting cabbages and making a healthy profit.
These conditions apply to another stage of the process.</p>
<p>There is a relationship between biological laws and conventional laws.
If one has planted grapes and it happens that the market that year
demands grapes, one can sell them at a good price and get rich. On
another occasion, however, one may grow watermelons, but many other
people do so as well, until the fruit floods the market and the price
drops. In that year one loses money. Apart from ordinary market forces,
there may be other factors involved, like middlemen who force the price
down. The important issue here, however, is to recognize the stability
and certainty of biological laws, and to discern both the distinction
and relationship between biological laws and conventional laws.</p>
<p>This comparison applies also to the law of kamma, which people often
confuse with conventional laws, by saying, ’Do good, receive good’, in
the sense that by doing good one will become rich or get a promotion.
Although these results are likely, they do not always occur. It is like
saying, ’Planting mangos is profitable’, ’Planting coconuts makes you
rich’, or ’Planting custard apples makes you poor’, which may or not be
true, but this sort of statement skips some stages in the process; it is
not a thorough description of the truth. It may be acceptable for
colloquial speech, but if one wishes to accurately portray the truth,
one needs to distinguish the various causes and conditions in an ordered
sequence.</p>
<h3 id="factors-promoting-and-obstructing-the-fruition-of-kamma"><a class="header" href="#factors-promoting-and-obstructing-the-fruition-of-kamma">Factors Promoting and Obstructing the Fruition of Kamma</a></h3>
<p>The way in which the law of kamma manifests in people’s lives,
determines various circumstances, and triggers responses from outside,
is outlined in the Pali Canon as relying on four pairs of factors: the
four accomplishments (<em>sampatti</em>) and the four defects (<em>vipatti</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn68-1"><a href="#fn-fn68">68</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Sampatti</em> may be translated as ’accomplishment’ or ’advantage’. It
refers to the fulfilment of those factors affording an opportunity for
good kamma to come to fruition, and preventing the effects of bad kamma
to surface. In brief, they are favourable to the ripening of good kamma.
They include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Gati-sampatti</em>: accomplishment of birth; fulfilment of birth;
favourable environment. One is born in a favourable state or realm
of existence, region, or country. In the present lifetime, one’s way
of life is conducive to wellbeing or one lives in a supportive
environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Upadhi-sampatti</em>: accomplishment of the body; fulfilment of body;
favourable or fortunate body. For instance: one has an attractive
body and graceful appearance; one is endearing to others; one is
healthy and strong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kāla-sampatti</em>: accomplishment of time; fulfilment of time;
favourable time. One is born in a time when one’s country is in a
state of peace, with good leaders and virtuous citizens, when people
praise righteousness and condemn evil. On an everyday level, one
acts in a timely and opportune fashion. {273}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Payoga-sampatti</em>: accomplishment of undertaking; fulfilment of
undertaking; favourable activity. For example: one acts
appropriately, in line with what is required; one’s actions
correspond with one’s abilities and strengths; one acts thoroughly,
decisively, and to one’s fullest capability. One is skilled at
carrying out work.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Vipatti</em> may be translated as ’defect’, ’weakness’, or ’disadvantage’.
It refers to the shortcomings and flaws of various factors, which are
unconducive to the fruition of good kamma and instead provide an
opportunity for the effects of bad kamma to manifest. In brief, they are
unfavourable factors triggering the ripening of bad kamma. They include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Gati-vipatti</em>: defect or failure as regards place of birth. One is
born in an uncultivated, unfavourable state of existence, region, or
country. One’s way of life is not conducive to wellbeing; one lives
in an unsupportive environ-ment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Upadhi-vipatti</em>: defect or failure as regards the body. For
example: one’s body is deformed, feeble, or unattractive; one’s
appearance is repulsive; one is unhealthy, afflicted by various
illnesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kāla-vipatti</em>: defect or failure as regards time. One is born in a
time when one’s country is in a state of peril, calamity, or
turbulence; the country’s leaders are immoral; the society is
degenerate and full of oppression, praising the wicked and
persecuting the virtuous. One acts in unseemly, inopportune ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Payoga-vipatti</em>: defect or failure as regards undertaking. For
example: one is engaged in wrongful activities; one’s actions do not
correspond with one’s abilities and strengths; one makes effort in
inappropriate ways; one’s efforts are half-baked.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="pair-1"><a class="header" href="#pair-1">Pair #1</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Accomplishment of birth: one is born in a developed region and
receives a good education. Although one’s inherent intelligence or
degree of effort is low, one still gets more education and gains a
higher position in society than someone with more intelligence and
diligence who is born in the countryside. Or one may be born as a
deva<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn69-1"><a href="#fn-fn69">69</a></sup>; however bad one’s character may be, one lives untroubled
and in comfort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defect as regards birth: e.g.: a Buddha appears and teaches the
Dhamma, but one is born in the outback or in hell, and one thus has
no opportunity to listen to the Dhamma; one is intelligent but one
is born in the wilderness of the so-called ’dark region’
(<em>kāḷa-dīpa</em>) and thus has no opportunity to become a learned member
of academic circles; one lives in a land or community where other
people do not appreciate one’s knowledge and skills, one does not
fit in, and one is looked down on or persecuted; a virtuous and
skilled person is in a position of work that does not complement his
skills – he is thus a burden for others and is unhappy (this final
example may also be accompanied by a defect as regards
undertaking).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn70-1"><a href="#fn-fn70">70</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="pair-2"><a class="header" href="#pair-2">Pair #2</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Accomplishment of the body: one has a beautiful and attractive
physical appearance. Although one may have been born in a poor
family or in a remote area, one’s physical appearance helps one to
attain a state of honour, prestige, and happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defect as regards the body: one is born in a fortunate location or
in an affluent family, but one is deformed or physically
handicapped. One thus does not obtain the prestige or pleasure
otherwise afforded by these circumstances.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When two people are matched in other attributes, in the case that
physical appearance is a factor for consideration, an attractive or
handsome person will often benefit over an unattractive or sickly
person. Even in the case when physical appearance is not ostensibly a
factor, it is normal for most people to incline towards someone with an
attractive appearance. Those people with defects as regards the body
must accept this truth of the world. They can reflect that only those
who are endowed with exceptional qualities, surpassing ordinary human
beings, are truly impartial and unbiased as regards physical attributes.
{274}</p>
<p>Knowing this, those people with defective bodies need not be distraught.
They should strive to cultivate other qualities that are exceptional and
outstanding. They may need to make two or three times the effort to
achieve this than the effort required by an attractive person to reach
certain forms of success. The important thing is to not get discouraged.
One is aware of what is lacking, and one hastens to strengthen those
factors that can be improved. An understanding of one’s kammic situation
is thus of benefit.</p>
<h4 id="pair-3"><a class="header" href="#pair-3">Pair #3</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Accomplishment of time: one is an honest and virtuous person born at
a time when one’s political leaders are morally upright and one’s
society extols virtue. As a consequence, one is honoured and
prospers, and one’s country is at peace. Wise people in such a
society are able to share their knowledge and benefit others.
Similarly, there may be a time when people cherish poetry; those who
are skilled poets will flourish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defect as regards time: here, the opposite is true: at a time when
society has grown corrupt and its leaders are devoid of
righteousness, good people are not praised and they may even be
abused. Even if one is intelligent and capable, it will be difficult
to engage in constructive work. When one’s country is in turmoil
because of war, few people are interested in those who advocate
peaceful means. Similarly, at a time when people prefer crude,
frenetic music, those people skilled at more subtle, tranquil forms
of music will find little favour.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="pair-4"><a class="header" href="#pair-4">Pair #4</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Accomplishment of undertaking: although one may not be endowed with
much virtue or ability, one knows with whom to associate, one knows
how to avoid those things that should be avoided, and one is able to
forfeit that which should be forfeited. In this way one is able to
prosper and one’s defects do not surface. Similarly, one may be
skilled at counterfeiting documents, but one uses this skill in a
positive way, for instance in examining legal evidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defect as regards undertaking: e.g.: one possesses sufficient
knowledge and one’s other personal attributes are favourable, but
one is addicted to gambling and thus one is not hired for a specific
job; one is superb at running and one has the potential to be a
prized sprinter, but one uses this talent to snatch people’s
belongings; one is an expert artisan but one performs some kind of
office work for which one lacks skill.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For the most part, results at the level of one’s way of life (level 3,
mentioned earlier) pertain to ’worldly things’ (<em>loka-dhamma</em>), which
are subject to fluctuation and uncertainty; they are relatively
superficial and do not touch upon the core of one’s life. Their degree
of impact on one’s life depends on one’s level of attachment. If one is
able to come to terms with these things, one’s happiness will remain
steady, or one’s suffering will be minimized. For this reason, the
Buddha encouraged people to develop wisdom accompanied by mindfulness,
and to be diligent and heedful. In times of happiness one does not get
carried away. In times of difficulty one does not become despondent or
overly distraught and slip into immoral or destructive ways of conduct;
rather, one alleviates the situation by way of wisdom and awareness.</p>
<p>When one still desires delightful and agreeable worldly things
(<em>iṭṭhārammaṇa</em>), one acknowledges one’s own advantages (<em>sampatti</em>) and
disadvantages (<em>vipatti</em>) – one’s strengths and weaknesses – and
embraces the former while avoiding the latter. One then tries to reach
desired goals and one benefits through wholesome actions, which bring
about a profound stability to all areas of one’s life. One refrains from
unwholesome conduct, because personal advantages and disadvantages are
uncertain; when favourable times pass, any bad actions one may have
committed bear fruit.</p>
<p>To sum up, when one is faced with various factors belonging to different
laws (<em>niyāma</em>; both laws of nature and conventional laws), one should
focus on cultivating goodness and integrity in relation to the law of
kamma; acting in this way provides a degree of stability and security.
Factors connected to other laws can then be applied with wisdom in a
supplementary way, in so far as they are not harmful. If one is able to
practise in this way, one is able to benefit from these four pairs of
accomplishments and defects, and one is able to apply both the laws of
nature and conventional laws to one’s advantage. {275}</p>
<p>Some people need to be reminded not to get caught up in such thoughts
as: ’Why did he succeed, even though he didn’t do anything good?’ ’Why
does nothing happen to her, even though she acted badly?’ ’Why doesn’t
anything good happen to me, even though I have acted virtuously?’ One
may fail to make a thorough inspection of factors linked with various
laws (<em>niyāma</em>), and thus conclude: ’I don’t possess the intelligence to
draw benefit from other sources, and even my inherited kammic factors
are unfavourable.’ If one remains caught up in these kinds of thoughts,
matters will most likely get worse.</p>
<p>According to the essential message of the Buddha’s teachings, people
performing good deeds do not get stuck at the stage of expecting mundane
personal rewards (<em>loka-dhamma</em>, i.e. material gain, honour, pleasure,
and praise), because true wholesome actions spring from the wholesome
roots of non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion. Such people act with
relinquishment (<em>cāga</em>), abandoning unwholesome qualities in their
hearts. By kindness and compassion they help others to be freed from
suffering, and they promote a peaceful coexistence among people. They
act with wisdom, in order to deepen an understanding of the truth, to
realize awakening, and to establish the Dhamma as the guiding force for
themselves and for society. This can be classified as the highest form
of kamma; it is kamma performed in order to bring about the end of
kamma, as referred to earlier.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn71-1"><a href="#fn-fn71">71</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="longterm-effects-of-kamma"><a class="header" href="#longterm-effects-of-kamma">Longterm Effects of Kamma</a></h3>
<p>The following material, on how kamma bears fruit in the longterm, for
instance over many lifetimes, is one part of the description on how the
fruits of kamma affect people’s lives; to a large extent it was covered
in the previous section. The reason for distinguishing this material
here is because many people show a special interest in this specific
matter. Although this matter won’t be discussed here at length, it seems
useful to offer some observations for the sake of study and
contemplation.</p>
<p>When either wholesome or unwholesome intention arises in the mind,
mental activity begins. The mind operates and is active. We can adopt
terms from the material world and refer to this activity as the force of
intention. Most people do not understand and are not even interested in
how this force of intention operates and what other conditions are
involved. They are only interested in the end results of the process.</p>
<p>The fruits of intention manifesting in the material world and in human
society are clearly visible. There are many examples of how the force of
intention manifests in the material world, especially in terms of
various inventions and devices, from shoes to spaceships, axes to
nuclear bombs, abaci to computers. Other examples include social systems
and institutions, including government systems, economic systems,
administrative systems, organization of work, etc.</p>
<p>These systems have a great deal of complexity. Indeed, the entire
process of intention, along with the mechanics of the mind through which
intention expresses itself or operates, is highly refined and complex.
It is no less complex than the most subtle and refined inventions or
systems created by it. {276}</p>
<p>Human beings possess ample knowledge about the history and development
of various inventions and social systems created by the mind and
originating with intention. Yet in respect to the nature of the mind and
the way in which the mind is conditioned by intention, we possess a
distinct lack of understanding. One can say that the workings of the
mind remain a great mystery for human beings, even though they affect us
directly and exert the greatest influence on our lives.</p>
<p>Due to this ignorance, when people encounter phenomena or situations
that are the end results of volitional activities, they often have a
disjointed understanding of cause and effect. They do not recognize the
associated factors involved, or at least not comprehensively, and end up
attributing or blaming various other things. Ignorant people do not
acknowledge the law of kamma, i.e. they do not believe in the law of
cause and effect, or in a natural causal process. The refusal to
acknowledge the law of kamma, or the misplaced blaming of other factors,
is then another level of volitional action (<em>kamma</em>), which has its own
adverse effects, namely, one squanders the opportunity to improve
oneself and to adapt those methods leading to desired results. More
gravely, one may falsely accuse others of collusion or involvement, or
perform other actions having more severe consequences.</p>
<p>In any case, the Buddha acknowledged that the intricacies of how
volitional actions bear fruit is an extremely complex matter, beyond the
power of thinking. People are unable to fathom the truth of this matter
by way of thought. In the Pali Canon, this matter is classified as
<em>acinteyya</em> (’imponderable’): a matter which shouldn’t be thought
about.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn72-1"><a href="#fn-fn72">72</a></sup> If one does not heed this warning and tries to unravel this
complexity by thinking, there is a chance of going crazy. This does not
mean that the Buddha forbids us to think about the fruits of kamma. It
simply explains that this complexity is ’inconceivable’; it cannot be
fully understood by way of reasoning. This matter can be understood,
however, by way of realization. Furthermore, the madness ensuing from
excessive pondering over this matter is not a punishment laid down by
the Buddha; it is simply a natural result of unresolved and confused
fretting.</p>
<p>Although this subject is classified as ’imponderable’, this does not
mean we should not take an interest in it. We can engage with this
subject according to our limited understanding, and gain confidence from
such understanding. We are able to contemplate those things that lie
within the field of our discernment, i.e, those things existing in the
present moment, beginning with minor matters and extending to more
significant, far-reaching ones. We can observe the effects of our
thoughts and intentions. How do wholesome thoughts lead to positive
results in our lives, and vice versa, how do unwholesome thoughts
generate negative results and cause damage? How do these effects have
wider consequences for other people, the society, and the world? And how
do they rebound on our own lives? One begins to understand the
complexity and subtlety of this multifaceted causal process, going
beyond one’s initial assumptions, and one then gains a confidence in the
causality inherent in nature.</p>
<p>An understanding of minor, short-term effects leads to an understanding
of how things unfold in the longterm. Indeed, the longterm effects
descend from and consist of the short-term effects. The longterm effects
could not exist were it not for the short-term effects. Here, an
understanding arises in line with the truth. A confidence in the natural
causal process involving intention is precisely a confidence and trust
in the law of kamma.</p>
<p>When one possesses trust in the law of kamma, whenever one desires
particular results, one expects these to occur by way of intentional
actions. One then proceeds to act in conformity with causes and
conditions, with a thorough understanding of the factors involved. If
one wishes for positive effects, both in respect to the law of kamma and
in respect to worldly things (<em>loka-dhamma</em>), one makes a complete
analysis of the various factors involved and then carefully generates
the necessary conditions for these things to arise. {277}</p>
<p>This analysis is not restricted to a person’s internal conceptual
activity; it applies also to external creative activity. People skilled
at inventing or creating things do not only focus on the content of
their own conceptualizations and intentions. They also take into account
relevant factors from other laws (<em>niyāma</em>), for example: an architect
uses artistic creative refinement to design a beautiful wooden house.
When she uses this design to build a real house she needs to consider
what kinds of hardwoods and softwoods are required for different parts
of the house. No matter how beautiful the design, if she uses conifer
wood where hardwood is required, the house may collapse and her project
may fail. Another architect may have a beautiful design but use
unattractive building materials and thus fail in his pursuit. Similarly,
if a fashion designer gets caught up in his own exquisite mental designs
without taking into consideration the climate of the country in
question, say by producing beautiful clothes suitable for a cold climate
but selling them in a hot climate, he too will fail in his endeavours.</p>
<p>Similarly, those people who are ’engineers’ or ’artisans’ designing a
wholesome way of life should be prudent in relating to causes and
conditions.</p>
<p>In the context of benefiting from the law of kamma, and ensuring that
one progresses in a wholesome direction, it is necessary to establish a
love of goodness (<em>kusala-chanda</em>) or a love of truth (<em>dhamma-chanda</em>).
In spiritual training, people should be encouraged to cultivate such an
aspiration and love for truth and goodness, say by wishing for one’s
life to be pure and virtuous, desiring a virtuous society, wishing for
all of those things one engages with to exist in a state of excellence
and integrity, or for them to reach an optimal state, and wishing for
the truth to pervade in all directions.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn73-1"><a href="#fn-fn73">73</a></sup></p>
<p>As long as people fail to have a love of truth and goodness, and are
simply infatuated by the delightful things in the world, they will try
to fool about with the law of kamma or to deceive the laws of nature.
(In fact, they are unable to deceive the laws of nature; rather, they
end up deceiving themselves.) As a consequence, they create an endless
amount of harm to themselves, to society, and to the human race.</p>
<h3 id="rebirth"><a class="header" href="#rebirth">Rebirth</a></h3>
<p>Many scholars claim that for ordinary people to believe in the law of
kamma and to be established in moral conduct, they must accept the
fruition of kamma over the longest span of time, i.e. from one birth to
the next. They go on to say that for this reason one must prove the
truth of rebirth, or at least show some substantiating evidence for
rebirth.</p>
<p>With this objective, or simply to seek knowledge, scholars and other
interested individuals have tried to explain the teaching of kamma and
rebirth, by citing scientific principles like the law of conservation of
energy, connecting them to the mental activity of volition, or they have
cited various psychological doctrines.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn74-1"><a href="#fn-fn74">74</a></sup> Alternatively, they have
sought evidence to prove the validity of recollection of past lives, or
even engaged in ceremonies invoking the spirits of the deceased.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn75-1"><a href="#fn-fn75">75</a></sup>
{278}</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this book to describe these explanations in
detail. Those readers interested in these matters can look into the
references cited above. Here, only some relevant observations and ideas
will be presented on this subject.</p>
<p>It is a very reasonable premise that by proving to people the legitimacy
of rebirth and of the next life, of the way in which kamma bears fruit
in the longterm, many practical benefits will ensue. If people believe
in rebirth and the longterm fruits of intentional actions, they are
likely to be receptive to teachings on morality, to fear wrongdoing, and
to undertake good deeds.</p>
<p>Those people who put forth this premise are generally well-intentioned
and there need not be any problems for them to continue their research.
Others can applaud their efforts in so far as their research is
connected to reasoned arguments and facts. One only need beware that
such research does not deviate into a path of gullibility, superstition,
or misunderstanding. Examples of misguided research include: rather than
clarifying mysterious matters, one enshrouds clearly verifiable matters
in mystery and secrecy; or rather than empowering people by drawing upon
the mysteries of the universe, one makes people more impotent by having
them become dependent on external things.</p>
<p>Sound research can benefit academic studies in these matters. Having
said this, this sort of research should be left to those scholars who
have a particular interest in it. Most people need not get caught up in
this activity. They can be kept informed of the proven research or of
particular developments in this field from a distance, as an interested
party. To wit, one should refrain from leading people into an obsession
with this subject.</p>
<p>Likewise, scholars and researchers should not become overly preoccupied
with past and future lives, to the extent of being biased and trying
simply to prove the authenticity of other lifetimes, which takes
importance away from the present moment and becomes a form of extreme
view. One needs to recognize both the advantages and disadvantages of
giving significance to this matter. If one overemphasizes it so that
people excessively fear being born in an unhappy existence and crave to
be born in a pleasant realm, this is tantamount to driving them to
expect and desire future results. They will then only take an interest
in those activities that are linked to reaping personal benefits in
future lifetimes, and they will neglect those benefits and blessings
that human beings should reach in this life.</p>
<p>If one is not circumspect and careful, the original aim of teaching
people to fear the adverse effects of bad kamma, to reassure them that
their good deeds now will bear good fruit even into future lifetimes,
and to trust in the law of kamma, leads to an unrestrained pursuit for
personal advantages in the next life. This generates greed and causes
people to perform meritorious deeds as a form of profiteering.</p>
<p>An overemphasis on the positive and negative fruits of kamma experienced
in future lifetimes also has the adverse effect of creating a disregard
for the training in a love of truth (<em>dhamma-chanda</em>) or a love of
goodness (<em>kusala-chanda</em>). This is a form of rejection or condemnation
of human beings’ abilities, by claiming that people cannot abstain from
evil or do good as a consequence of aspiring towards the pure and
sublime. {279} Instead, they only abstain from evil and do good out of
greed and a desire for personal rewards, and they neglect to cultivate a
love of truth and goodness in a genuine way.</p>
<p>Although there is a lot of logic in the claim that if one provides clear
evidence to people for the truth of rebirth, they will believe in it and
be well-established in moral conduct, yet to actually wait for people to
develop such moral conduct only after they see the evidence is
unreasonable. This is because the <em>if</em> in the above sentence indicates
that one cannot be sure when one will be able to fully succeed at
proving this truth to others. Strictly speaking, one cannot validly use
the expression ’provide clear evidence’ in regard to this matter,
because no one is able to reveal the rebirth of one person to another.
Rebirth is something that one must know and realize for oneself.</p>
<p>The expression ’provide clear evidence’ here simply refers to finding
testimonials about rebirth and analyzing the facts. The heart of this
matter corresponds to the imponderables (<em>acinteyya</em>), i.e. one is
unable to comprehend this matter by way of logic and reasoning; it is
beyond the scope of ordinary understanding. No matter how much evidence
one provides on this subject to ordinary people, it remains on the level
of faith or belief. The only difference between people is that some may
disbelieve while others believe, or some may believe more than others.
This being the case, there will remain those people who disbelieve, and
even those believers may harbour doubt or skepticism. And those people
who disbelieve also remain on the level of belief, that is, they believe
that rebirth does not exist; they have not yet gained a clear
understanding of this matter. Doubt and suspicion remains until one has
done away with all doubt, by realizing stream-entry.</p>
<p>In sum, the attempt to present reasoned explanations and testimonials
about rebirth to people can be beneficial (if such attempts do not
conflict with other key Buddhist principles, for instance they do not
make people dependent on external powers or lead them to seek help from
mysterious forces). But the claim that practising the Dhamma or living a
life in harmony with Buddhist principles requires proof regarding the
matter of rebirth is unsuitable and incorrect.</p>
<h3 id="proper-relationship-to-the-next-life"><a class="header" href="#proper-relationship-to-the-next-life">Proper Relationship to the Next Life</a></h3>
<p>Many people are fascinated and preoccupied with the questions whether
past and future lives exist, or whether heaven and hell exist; this is
because these matters remain mysteries obscured by people’s ignorance.
It seems appropriate to say a bit more about these subjects, especially
in regard to whether one is able to prove their authenticity.</p>
<p>First, according to a literal translation of the Buddhist scriptures,
these things do indeed exist.</p>
<p>Second, there is no end in trying to prove the truth of these matters.
No one is able to definitively convince someone else of the existence or
non-existence of these things. Generally speaking, these matters remain
on the level of belief. On the whole, neither those people who accept
the truth of these things nor those people who deny them have a clear
understanding of life’s course, both in regard to themselves and to
others. They are both in the dark about the past, and they lack an
understanding even of the circumstances surrounding being born in this
lifetime. Similarly, they are unable to discern the future, even about
what is going to occur tomorrow. {280}</p>
<p>Third, in terms of seeking proof of something, there exists the
guideline that that which is visible needs to be seen by the eye, that
which is audible needs to heard by the ear, that which is gustable needs
to tasted by the tongue, etc. A dozen ears and tongues cannot verify a
visible form, nor can a score of eyes and noses verify an audible sound.
Moreover, if one is incapable of receiving certain wavelengths or
frequencies, visible or audible perception will not occur. Certain
things seen by a cat are invisible even to ten times the capability of a
human eye; likewise, certain things heard by a bat are inaudible to ten
times the capability of a human ear.</p>
<p>From one perspective, rebirth manifests as a direct experience; it is a
phenomenon occurring in the mind. Therefore, it can only be verified by
the mind itself. Attempts to prove the truth of rebirth may thus follow
this sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Verification by way of the mind: in this context the scriptures
recommend using a mind that is well-concentrated. If one is
disinclined to use this method, or if one fears that a mentally
created image (<em>nimitta</em>) arising in concentration will be
deceptive, one may use one of the following methods:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification by sacrificing one’s life: by definition, no one who is
alive has experienced death in this lifetime. If one really wishes
to prove the truth of rebirth, one must thus choose to die, but
naturally, no one wishes to undergo such a test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verification by way of case histories and reasoned arguments: for
example, one seeks out stories of those people who remember past
lives and investigates these accounts; or one compares this matter
with the verification of other aspects of truth, for instance in the
example above of examining wavelengths of light or frequencies of
sound. These rational presentations help to validate this matter,
although, granted, the understanding remains on the level of belief,
not direct knowledge.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fourth, no matter how strong a person’s beliefs (or denials), or how
much evidence is presented about rebirth, that which is undeniable and
inescapable, and which acts as the link to the next life (whether one
believes in it or not), is namely this present lifetime, which everyone
must relate to and engage with.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the present life that requires the majority of our care
and attention. Buddhism is a religion of practice and application. The
main focus is on how we behave in relation to this lifetime: how we
conduct ourselves in the present and make the most of this life, in
order to live well and, in the case that a future life does exist, to be
confident that one’s goodness and virtue carries over into the future.</p>
<p>In this context, there are several observations and recommendations for
one’s spiritual practice:</p>
<p>In the original Pali Canon, i.e. in the suttas, there are very few
descriptions of past and future lives, and of heaven and hell, and in
most cases these subjects are mentioned or referred to in brief.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn76-1"><a href="#fn-fn76">76</a></sup> If
one compares these to the teachings pertaining to the present life, say
to the development of morality, concentration, and wisdom, one sees that
the percentage is very small.</p>
<p>In the canonical descriptions of the adverse effects of bad kamma and
the blessings of good kamma, if there is a mention of being born in
heaven or hell, these statements are generally added after mentioning
several (sometimes up to ten) results that one is likely to experience
in this lifetime. These present lifetime results may be followed by the
phrase: ’With the breakup of the body, after death, one is reborn in the
plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell’, or
by the phrase: ’One is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly
world.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn77-1"><a href="#fn-fn77">77</a></sup> {281}</p>
<p>Note how the results in this life are given prime significance and are
clearly distinguished; the results after death are merely tagged on to
the end to complete the account. Moreover, the presentation of positive
and negative effects is outlined as a description of facts according
with a causal process. One need not beseech or wish for these effects to
take place; they occur automatically. An awareness of this leads to
confidence and assurance.</p>
<p>For those people who deny rebirth, as long as they have not truly
penetrated the truth of this matter and remain on the level of belief
(i.e. they believe rebirth to be untrue), they are unable to fully
dispel deep-seated doubts in their own minds. When the strength and
excitement of youth wanes and old-age begins to take hold, these people
often begin to fear the possibility of a next life. If they have not
prepared themselves in regard to virtue, they experience affliction. For
the sake of assurance and ease, regardless of whether the next life is
true or not, such people should spend their lives performing good deeds.</p>
<p>Those people who believe in rebirth should contemplate in the following
manner:</p>
<p>They should base their belief solidly on the principle of causality,
that is, they should view the results in a future life as a continuation
of one’s state of mind established in this lifetime. Moreover, they
should emphasize doing good in the present moment, in order to cultivate
a wholesome life and state of mind, so that any possible future lives
are also endowed with goodness and virtue.</p>
<p>With such an emphasis, one’s involvement with and expectation around
future lives will be based securely in the present, and one will place
greater importance on this lifetime. No matter how fascinated one may be
with future lives, one still gives more significance to this life, and
one does not perform good actions as a form of investment or pursuit of
personal profit.</p>
<p>A sound belief in future lives helps to abandon or reduce a reliance on
divine intervention or on external powers. This is because a genuine
belief in future lives implies a belief in one’s own good actions. It
leads to a confidence in one’s own wholesome actions acting as the cause
for advancing and prospering in the round of rebirth (<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>).
A dependence on external powers, on the other hand, makes one more
feeble, and it causes one to regress or fall behind in the round of
rebirth. If someone has lapsed into such a dependence, he or she should
hasten to step back and generate a sense of individual strength and
authority.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether one believes or disbelieves in rebirth, one needs
to reach the stage at which one abstains from evil and performs the good
irrespective of one’s beliefs. If one is a believer, one acts without
any expectations in regard to future lives, and if one disbelieves one
simply abstains from doing bad. This stage can be reached by practising
in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One develops a genuine love of truth (<em>dhamma-chanda</em>) or a love of
goodness (<em>kusala-chanda</em>). One cultivates an aspiration for truth,
a love of virtue, a wish for refinement and purity, and a desire for
things to reach their optimal state.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn78-1"><a href="#fn-fn78">78</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One develops an interest in profound internal bliss. An experience
of such bliss in itself protects against evil, unskilful actions and
supports wholesome actions. This is because one prerequisite for
experiencing such bliss is an absence of immoral behaviour
(<em>duccarita</em>) and an engagement with virtuous behaviour
(<em>sucarita</em>). Moreover, the realization of such bliss curbs a level
of infatuation with sense pleasure by which one is prone to
performing wicked or unskilful acts. Having said this, in regard to
profound mundane bliss, one still needs to exercise caution so that
one does not indulge in it to the extent of undermining one’s
efforts or of impeding one’s spiritual progress.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn79-1"><a href="#fn-fn79">79</a></sup> {282}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One develops wisdom and lives one’s life in accord with wisdom. One
develops a comprehensive understanding of the world and of
conditioned phenomena, to the extent of reaching an adequate level
of freedom and independence. One is not captivated by material
things or by sense objects to the extent that one would act
immorally for their sake. One recognizes the happiness and
unhappiness of other people and other creatures, giving rise to
compassionate assistance; one is not inclined to oppress or harm
others.</p>
<p>This level of wisdom is reached by those individuals who have
realized the transcendent (<em>lokuttara-dhamma</em>) and who have
cultivated transcendent right-view (<em>lokuttara-sammādiṭṭhi</em>). At
least, it is reached by those people who practise and conduct their
lives in order to realize the transcendent.</p>
<p>If one is unable to reach this level of wisdom, then one should
develop faith, which is the preliminary stage for wisdom to arise.
This faith is accompanied by understanding and is conducive to
wisdom. Here, one believes in the path of wisdom and trusts in a
life of freedom based on wisdom. Through one’s own efforts one
gradually incorporates these principles of wisdom and
compassion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn80-1"><a href="#fn-fn80">80</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three factors are interconnected and mutually supportive. In
particular, the first factor, of developing a love of truth and
goodness, is required for all wholesome activities, which act as the
basis for factors two and three.</p>
<p>If one develops these three factors, the belief in actions bearing fruit
in future lives reinforces one’s determination to do good and abstain
from the bad. This belief, however, is not the decisive factor
determining one’s wholesome actions.</p>
<p>If people’s spiritual practice is still unsteady and they are unable to
develop these three factors, it is still better to maintain a belief in
the fruits of kamma in future lives as an incentive for doing good and
refraining from bad, than to indulge in sensual pleasures and seek out
material things for personal gratification. Such an indulgence simply
leads to mutual oppression, widespread wrongdoing, and personal and
social misfortune. In any case, the belief in the fruits of kamma
extending to future lives is designated as an aspect of ’mundane
right-view’ (<em>lokiya-sammādiṭṭhi</em>), which acts as a link facilitating
progress on the path of virtue.</p>

<p>At this point, let us examine an important teaching by the Buddha
contained in the Cūḷakammavibhaṅga Sutta, on the fruits of kamma
resulting from the present and manifesting in future lives. The gist of
this teaching is as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Student, beings are owners of their actions, heirs of their actions;
they originate from their actions, are related to their actions, have
their actions as their refuge. It is action that distinguishes beings
as inferior and superior.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Some man or woman kills living beings and is brutal,
murderous, merciless to living beings. Because of performing and
undertaking such action, after death, he reappears in a state of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in
hell. But if instead he comes back to the human state, then
wherever he is reborn he is short-lived. {283}</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Some man or woman abstains from killing living beings;
gentle and kindly, he abides compassionate to all living beings.
Because of performing and undertaking such action, after death, he
reappears in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world. But
if instead he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is
reborn he is long-lived.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Some man or woman is given to injuring beings with a fist,
with a rod, with a weapon. Because of performing and undertaking
such action, after death, he reappears in a state of deprivation,
in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. But if
instead he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is
reborn he is sickly.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Some man or woman is not given to injuring beings. Because
of performing and undertaking such action, after death, he
reappears in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world. But
if instead he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is
reborn he is healthy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Some man or woman is easily angered and annoyed; due to
the slightest criticism, he is offended, becomes angry and
hostile, and displays wrath and fury. Because of performing and
undertaking such action, after death, he reappears in a state of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in
hell. But if instead he comes back to the human state, then
wherever he is reborn he is ugly.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Some man or woman is not easily angered. Because of
performing and undertaking such action, after death, he reappears
in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world. But if instead
he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he is
attractive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Some man or woman is envious; he resents and begrudges
when others receive honour or veneration. Because of performing
and undertaking such action, after death, he reappears in a state
of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in
hell. But if instead he comes back to the human state, then
wherever he is reborn he is uninfluential.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Some man or woman is not envious. Because of performing
and undertaking such action, after death, he reappears in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world. But if instead he comes
back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he is
influential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Some man or woman does not practise generosity; he does
not give food, drink, clothing, etc. to others. Because of
performing and undertaking such action, after death, he reappears
in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in
perdition, even in hell. But if instead he comes back to the human
state, then wherever he is reborn he is poor.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Some man or woman practises generosity, giving away food,
drink, clothing, etc. Because of performing and undertaking such
action, after death, he reappears in a happy destination, even in
the heavenly world. But if instead he comes back to the human
state, then wherever he is reborn he is wealthy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Some man or woman is obstinate and arrogant, looking down
on others; he does not pay homage, honour, or show deference to
those who are worthy of such treatment. Because of performing and
undertaking such action, after death, he reappears in a state of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in
hell. But if instead he comes back to the human state, then
wherever he is reborn he is lowborn. {284}</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Some man or woman is not obstinate and arrogant; he pays
homage, honours, and shows deference to those who are worthy of
such treatment. Because of performing and undertaking such action,
after death, he reappears in a happy destination, even in the
heavenly world. But if instead he comes back to the human state,
then wherever he is reborn he is high-born.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(a)</strong> Some man or woman does not approach recluses or brahmins
and ask about what is wholesome and unwholesome, harmful and
beneficial, worthy and unworthy of cultivation, or about which
actions lead to long-lasting suffering and which actions lead to
long-lasting happiness. Because of performing and undertaking such
action, after death, he reappears in a state of deprivation, in an
unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. But if instead he
comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he is
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>(b)</strong> Some man or woman approaches recluses and brahmins and
asks about what is wholesome and unwholesome, etc. Because of
performing and undertaking such action, after death, he reappears
in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world. But if instead
he comes back to the human state, then wherever he is reborn he is
intelligent.</p>

<p><em>Subha Sutta: M. III. 202-206. (This is an abbreviated translation.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Although this sutta describes the results one may experience in future
lives, it emphasizes actions performed in this present life. In
particular, it emphasizes those actions performed regularly or
consistently in one’s daily life, which help to shape one’s state of
mind, character traits, and personality, and which function as direct
causes for specific results. It does not focus on extravagant or
exaggerated results, in the sense of performing a single action, say of
making a donation, and then receiving some boundless rewards or being
able to wish for whatever one desires. Such a selfish focus leads people
to perform good deeds similar to investing money in a bank and idly
awaiting the interest, or playing the lottery once and expecting an
enormous prize. People then neglect those general or everyday wholesome
actions outlined in this sutta. (See
Note <a href="#note-subha">The Creator and Rituals in the Subha Sutta</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">The Creator and Rituals in the Subha Sutta</span><a id="note-subha"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This sutta contains a conversation between the Buddha and the young
brahmin student Subha. The Buddha’s teachings in this sutta can be
viewed in light of Brahmanism.</p>
<p>First, they are a way of disputing the brahmanistic teaching that the
God Brahma is the creator of human beings and all things in the world.
The Buddha offers an alternative teaching, stating that human
volitional actions themselves are the determining factors shaping
human life.</p>
<p>Second, according to brahmanistic rituals, e.g. animal sacrifices,
those people who perform these rituals and make offerings to the
brahmin priests are told they can expect copious rewards, without
there being any obvious causal relationship between the action and its
results. The Buddha’s explanations in this sutta on the fruits of
kamma provides a new perspective on this subject.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In sum, the teachings in this sutta maintain the key principle that a
consideration of fruits of kamma ripening in a future life should be
based on a confidence and understanding that these results rely on a
quality of mind and a quality of behaviour established in this present
life. These longterm future results are directly connected to the
present in line with cause and effect.</p>
<p>One way of analyzing this matter is to say that any valid belief
connected to future lives must help to reinforce and stabilize one’s
love of truth (<em>dhamma-chanda</em>). If, on the other hand, one’s beliefs
merely promote greed and craving, one can confidently state that they
are false beliefs and in need of revision. {285}</p>
<h2 id="additional-matters-pertaining-to-kamma"><a class="header" href="#additional-matters-pertaining-to-kamma">Additional Matters Pertaining to Kamma</a></h2>
<p>There are several more important points pertaining to kamma. Some of
these points help to prevent serious misunderstandings from arising,
while others help to complete one’s understanding of this subject.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-cause-for-happiness-and-suffering"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-cause-for-happiness-and-suffering">What is the Cause for Happiness and Suffering?</a></h3>
<p>Several teachings by the Buddha emphasize how volitional actions
(<em>kamma</em>) and their results proceed in line with cause and effect. For
example: ’Conditioned by ignorance, a person produces volitional acts of
the body (<em>kāya-saṅkhāra</em>) … volitional acts of speech
(<em>vacī-saṅkhāra</em>) … volitional acts of mind (<em>mano-saṅkhāra</em>), either
self-generated … or owing to other agents … either knowingly … or
unknowingly.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn81-1"><a href="#fn-fn81">81</a></sup> Similarly, the Buddha refuted the doctrine of karmic
autogenesism (<em>attakāra-vāda</em>), which states that happiness and
suffering are entirely self-determined, and the doctrine of karmic
heterogenesism (<em>parakāra-vāda</em>), which states that happiness and
suffering are entirely caused by external factors.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn82-1"><a href="#fn-fn82">82</a></sup> One must
investigate each distinctive process in order to determine the degree of
involvement by oneself and/or by external factors. One should not make a
definitive judgement based on a simple glance or analysis.</p>
<p>These teachings help to prevent the extreme misunderstanding of kamma
that all things arise exclusively due to one’s own actions, without
taking into account external or environmental factors that play a
participatory role.</p>
<p>Here it is important to distinguish between the principle of kamma as a
natural law and kamma from the perspective of ethical conduct. So far
the discussion has focused on kamma as a natural law, which pertains to
natural dynamics of volitional action, and which incorporate all of the
myriad causes and conditions involved.</p>
<p>The teachings on kamma related to ethics, however, are practical and to
be applied. They are mainly focused on individual people, who should
take full and entire responsibility for their intentional actions. For
these teachings to fulfil their true objective, they begin by
emphasizing personal responsibility. One example is the Buddha’s
teaching: ’One is one’s own refuge.’</p>
<p>Besides emphasizing the need to help oneself and to initiate actions,
these teachings also point to a relationship to other people’s actions.
That is, for other people to successfully offer assistance to oneself,
one must first establish self-reliance. One’s self-reliance will
influence the degree of assistance others are willing to give, and it
also influences one’s own response to such external assistance.</p>
<p>Through proper investigation one sees how the principle of kamma as a
natural law and the principle of kamma in relation to ethics are not
contradictory; rather they are mutually supportive. {286}</p>
<h3 id="misinterpretations-of-kamma"><a class="header" href="#misinterpretations-of-kamma">Misinterpretations of Kamma</a></h3>
<p>There are three wrong views pertaining to happiness and suffering that
need to be distinguished from the Buddhist teaching on kamma:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Past-action determinism (<em>pubbekatahetu-vāda</em>; <em>pubbekata-vāda</em>):
the belief that all happiness and suffering is a result of past
kamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theistic determinism (<em>issaranimmānahetu-vāda</em>;
<em>issaranimmita-vāda</em>): the belief that all happiness and suffering
is created by a supreme God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indeterminism (or accidentalism; <em>ahetu-apaccaya-vāda</em>;
<em>ahetu-vāda</em>): the belief that all happiness and suffering arises
dependent on arbitrary acts of fate, without cause or condition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These wrong views are described in this sutta passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these three sectarian tenets, which, when questioned,
interrogated, and cross-examined by the wise, are attributed to
passed-down traditions, and which are firmly established in the
principle of non-doing (<em>akiriya</em>). What are the three?:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are some ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and
view as this: ’Whatever a person experiences – whether pleasure,
pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain – all that is caused by what
was done in the past (<em>pubbekata-hetu</em>).’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are other ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and
view as this: ’Whatever a person experiences – whether pleasure,
pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain – all that is caused by God’s
creative power (<em>issaranimmāna-hetu</em>).’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And there are still other ascetic and brahmins who hold such a
doctrine and view as this: ’Whatever a person experiences –
whether pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain – all that
occurs without a cause or condition (<em>ahetu-apaccaya</em>).’</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Monks, I approached that [first group of] ascetics and brahmins and
I asked them: ’Is it true that you venerable ones hold such a doctrine
and view?’ When I ask them this and they affirm it, then I say to
them: ’In such a case, it is due to past deeds that you might destroy
life, take what is not given, indulge in sexual activity, speak
falsehood … and hold wrong view.’</p>
<p>Those who fall back on past deeds as the essential truth have no
desire or endeavour in this respect: ’This should be done; this should
be avoided.’ Since they do not truly apprehend that which should be
done and that which should be avoided, these ascetics and brahmins are
deluded and devoid of safeguards; they possess no legitimate personal
doctrine of an ascetic. This was my first legitimate censure of those
ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view.</p>
<p>Monks, I approached that [second group of] ascetics and brahmins and
I asked them: ’Is it true…?’ Then I say to them: ’In such a case, it
is due to God’s creative power that you might destroy life, take what
is not given, indulge in sexual activity, speak falsehood … and hold
wrong view.’ {287}</p>
<p>Those who fall back on God’s creative activity as the essential truth
have no desire or endeavour in this respect: ’This should be done;
this should be avoided….’</p>
<p>Monks, I approached that [third group of] ascetics and brahmins and
I asked them: ’Is it true…?’ Then I say to them: ’In such a case, it
is without a cause or condition that you might destroy life, take what
is not given, indulge in sexual activity, speak falsehood … and hold
wrong view.’</p>
<p>Those who fall back on an absence of cause and conditions as the
essential truth have no desire or endeavour in this respect: ’This
should be done; this should be avoided …’</p>
<p><em>A. I. 173-5; cf.: M. II. 214-23; Vbh. 367-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The first doctrine (of past-action determinism) was held by the Nigaṇṭhā
(Jains), as confirmed by this sutta passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are some recluses and brahmins who hold such a doctrine
and view as this: ’Whatever a person feels, whether pleasure, or pain,
or whatever kind of feeling, all that is caused by what was done in
the past. So by annihilating through asceticism past actions and by
doing no fresh actions, there will be no binding authority in the
future. With no binding authority in the future, there is the
destruction of action. With the destruction of action, there is the
destruction of suffering. With the destruction of suffering, there is
the destruction of feeling. With the destruction of feeling, all
suffering will be exhausted.’ So speak the Nigaṇṭhas, monks.</p>
<p><em>M. II. 214.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Here is a similar sutta passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Some feelings, Sīvaka, arise originating from bile disorders …
produced by a change of climate … produced by irregular exercise …
caused by assault … produced as the result of kamma…. Those
ascetics and brahmins hold such a doctrine and view as this: ’Whatever
feeling a person experiences, whether pleasure, pain, or
neither-pleasure-nor-pain, all that is caused by what was done in the
past….’ I say that this is wrong on the part of those ascetics and
brahmins.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 230.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These teachings by the Buddha prevent people from falling into extreme
or unreasonable views, whereby they only understand kamma in the context
of actions performed in the past. By holding to such views people simply
sit around waiting for the results of past kamma to determine their
destiny. They do not consider how to actively improve themselves in the
present. These misunderstandings develop into pernicious forms of wrong
view, as described in the passages above.</p>
<p>Moreover, one can clearly see from these words that the Buddha regarded
determined effort to be at the heart of all his teachings on kamma; the
value of these teachings is determined by their relationship to effort.</p>
<p>These teachings by the Buddha do not negate past kamma; it is
acknowledged that past kamma is involved in the causal process and
influences the present moment. The past and the present are both part of
the dynamic of cause and effect. The key principle here is that past
kamma is connected to causality; it is not related to some kind of
presumed supernatural reality to which one must entrust one’s destiny. A
clear understanding of Dependent Origination, in particular, will help
to dispel any doubts about this matter. {288}</p>
<p>This may be compared to someone who climbs up a three storey building.
It is irrefutable that the arrival at the third floor is dependent on
that person’s action – the act of walking up the stairs. And once up on
the third floor, it is impossible for this person to reach out his hand
and touch the ground or to get in a car and drive around as if he was on
the road. These similarly irrefutable facts are also dependent on his
climbing up to the third floor. In the same way, were he to feel
exhausted from climbing and unable to go up or down until he had a rest,
that exhaustion too would be dependent on his actions.</p>
<p>It is beyond question that the arrival at the third floor, the range of
activities available at this location, and the need to engage with
whatever objects are found here, are all consequences of a previous
action – of having walked up the stairs. But whatever that person then
does, whether it entails interacting with those things found in this
place, having a rest, or descending the stairs, are all based on new
decisions. There is a range of possibilities, and each choice leads to
specific results. Although the previous actions may still be exerting an
effect, for example the man may be tired from walking, it is up to him
whether to give in to this tiredness and have a rest or whether to
respond to it in some other way. All of these factors, including past
kamma, are part of a causal process.</p>
<p>Based on an understanding of Dependent Origination, one can benefit from
past kamma, by drawing lessons from it, strengthening reasoned
discernment, and increasing an understanding of various phenomena,
including an understanding of one’s current mental disposition, so that
one can make plans for the present and act to bring about good results
in the future.</p>
<h3 id="purifying-kamma"><a class="header" href="#purifying-kamma">Purifying Kamma</a></h3>
<p>The Buddha taught:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, if one were to say thus: ’This person experiences kamma in
precisely the same way that he created it’, in such a case there could
be no living of the holy life (<em>brahmacariya</em>) and no opportunity would
be seen for completely making an end of suffering.</p>
<p>But if one were to say thus: ’This person creates kamma that is a
basis for a particular kind of feeling (<em>vedanā</em>), he experiences its
result precisely in that way’, in such a case the living of the holy
life is possible and an opportunity is seen for completely making an
end of suffering.</p>
<p>Here, monks, some person has created minor bad kamma yet it leads him
to hell, while some other person here has created exactly the same
minor kamma yet it produces results in this very life, with none of
the insignificant aspects [of this kamma] manifest, only [its]
significant aspects.</p>
<p>What kind of person creates minor bad kamma that leads him to hell?
Here, some person is undeveloped in body, morality, mind, and wisdom;
his mind is limited, he is of inferior character, and he is afflicted
by petty concerns. When such a person creates minor bad kamma, it
leads him to hell.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn83-1"><a href="#fn-fn83">83</a></sup> {289}</p>
<p>What kind of person creates exactly the same minor bad kamma and yet
it produces results in this very life, with none of the insignificant
aspects manifest, only [its] significant aspects? Here, some person
is developed in body, morality, mind, and wisdom. He is high-minded
and of lofty character, and he dwells without measure. When such a
person creates exactly the same minor bad kamma, it produces results
in this very life, with none of the insignificant aspects manifest,
only [its] significant aspects.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn84-1"><a href="#fn-fn84">84</a></sup></p>
<p>Here, headman, some teacher holds such a doctrine and view as this:
’Anyone at all who destroys life … takes what is not given …
engages in sexual misconduct … speaks falsehood is bound for a state
of misery, is bound for hell.’ A disciple who has full confidence in
that teacher considers: ’My teacher holds such a doctrine and view as
this: “Anyone at all who destroys life is bound for a state of misery,
bound for hell”.’ He acquires the view: ’Now I have destroyed life, so
I too am bound for a state of misery, bound for hell.’ If he does not
abandon that assertion and that idea, and if he does not relinquish
that view, then he will be, as it were, dropped into hell….</p>
<p>But here a Tathāgata arises in the world…. In many ways he
criticizes and censures the destruction of life … the taking of what
is not given … sexual misconduct … false speech, and he says:
’Abstain from the destruction of life … the taking of what is not
given … sexual misconduct … false speech.’ A disciple who has full
confidence in that teacher reflects thus: ’In many ways the Blessed
One criticizes and censures the destruction of life … and he says:
“Abstain from the destruction of life….” Now I have destroyed life
to such and such an extent. That wasn’t proper; that wasn’t good.
Certainly, I am distressed as a consequence of these actions, and I am
not free from the label of one who has done evil.’ Having reflected
thus, he abandons the destruction of life and he abstains from the
destruction of life in the future. Thus there comes about the
abandoning of that evil deed….</p>
<p>He abandons the destruction of life and abstains from the destruction
of life. He abandons taking what is not given … sexual misconduct
… false speech … divisive speech … harsh speech … idle chatter
… covetousness … ill-will … wrong view; he is one of right view.</p>
<p>That noble disciple – who is thus devoid of covetousness, devoid of
ill-will, undeluded, clearly comprehending, ever mindful – dwells
pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with lovingkindness, likewise
the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus
above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he
dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with
lovingkindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without hostility, without
ill-will…. When the liberation of mind by lovingkindness is
developed and cultivated in this way, any moderate kamma that was done
does not remain there, does not persist there.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 319-23.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These teachings by the Buddha are presented to help clarify some of the
subtle details of the fruition of kamma. They act as a precaution
against establishing an opinion on kamma too quickly or interpreting its
meaning too simply. Having said this, these are only a few examples of
the teachings on kamma. {290}</p>
<h3 id="redeeming-kamma"><a class="header" href="#redeeming-kamma">Redeeming Kamma</a></h3>
<p><em>Paṭikamma</em> is an important term in the teachings on kamma. Based on its
original meaning, or as a play on its original meaning, it may be
translated as ’to redeem kamma’. In this sense it refers to restoration,
rectification, rehabilitation, amendment, or the abandoning of bad kamma
and doing good kamma instead.</p>
<p><em>Paṭikamma</em> was originally a common, everyday term used in the sense of
repairing something damaged, correcting something defective, righting
something wrong, or even in relation to curing an illness.</p>
<p>In the context of Dhamma teachings, the term <em>paṭikamma</em> refers
essentially to an acknowledgement of one’s own past mistakes, a
relinquishment of unwholesome and harmful actions, a turning away from
bad actions and a resulting performance of good actions,
self-improvement through good deeds, and rectifying one’s faults in
order to arrive at integrity and completeness.</p>
<p>In relation to the monastic community, the Buddha applied the principle
of <em>paṭikamma</em> for laying down two kinds of disciplinary prescriptions:
expiation of offences (<em>āpatti-paṭikamma</em>) and a formal invitation for
admonishment (<em>pavāraṇā-kamma</em>). Moreover, in a wider context,
encompassing both renunciants and laypeople, the Buddha emphasized
performing redress accompanied by an awareness and confession of one’s
wrongdoing (referred to as confession of one’s transgressions –
<em>accaya-desanā</em>), which is considered a practice corresponding to the
code of the noble ones (<em>ariya-vinaya</em>).</p>
<p>In the Dhammavinaya<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn85-1"><a href="#fn-fn85">85</a></sup> there are thus three basic procedures for
rectifying one’s faults within a social context:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Expiation of offences (<em>āpatti-paṭikamma</em>): atonement; repentance.
This is a disciplinary prescription for the monastic community. If a
bhikkhu or bhikkhuni has committed an offence, he or she is aware of
this transgression and discloses it to others. He or she openly
renounces such misdeeds and determines not to repeat them. One
informs others of this determination in order to be restrained in
the future.</p>
<p>This standard is applied even when someone has doubts. For example,
on the Uposatha Day (’observance day’ – the full and new-moon
days), if a bhikkhu suspects that he may have incurred an offence,
he informs another bhikkhu in this way: ’Venerable sir, I have
doubts in regard to an offence of such-and-such a name. When these
doubts vanish, the offence will have been atoned for.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn86-1"><a href="#fn-fn86">86</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formal invitation for admonishment (<em>pavāraṇā-kamma</em>). This too is a
disciplinary prescription for the monastic community. Abbreviated to
the term Pavāraṇā, it constitutes an annual ceremony – a formal act
of the sangha (<em>saṅgha-kamma</em>) – performed at the end of the Rainy
Season retreat (<em>vassa</em>). After having lived together for the Vassa,
the resident bhikkhus or bhikkhunis convene and each individual
makes a formal invitation to the gathering. Beginning with the most
senior member of the community, each individual states: ’Venerable
friends, I make a formal invitation to the sangha. If you have seen,
heard, or suspected (that I have made any mistakes or acted in any
harmful ways), may you admonish me out of compassion. Having
recognized (these mistakes), I will rectify them.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn87-1"><a href="#fn-fn87">87</a></sup> {291}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confession of one’s transgressions (<em>accaya-desanā</em>). This is a
principle of conduct integral to the noble discipline
(<em>ariya-vinaya</em>), applicable to both members of the monastic
community and to laypeople. The gist of this principle is that when
one commits an offence, makes a mistake, or behaves badly in
relation to someone else, one makes amends by asking for
forgiveness. Expressing one’s remorse to others for transgressions
and offences, and requesting others to acknowledge the recognition
of one’s mistakes in order for one to make amends and to show
restraint in the future, is growth in the noble discipline.</p>
<p>There are many stories in the Tipiṭaka of laypeople, and even of
monks, who act offensively towards the Buddha. When they recognize
their mistakes, they confess and ask forgiveness from him. The
Buddha would answer by saying that he accepts their apology if they
recognize the harm in their transgressions committed by way of
delusion or stupidity, and if they make amends. He would reiterate
how acknowledging one’s mistakes, making amends, and being careful
in the future is growth in the noble discipline.</p>
<p>Take for example the archer who was hired to assassinate the Buddha.
He went to express his remorse to the Buddha, who stated: ’Because
you see the harm in that which is harmful, and make genuine amends,
I accept and acknowledge your mistake. For anyone, to discern the
harm in the harmful and to make righteous amends by afterwards
showing caution, is growth in the noble discipline.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn88-1"><a href="#fn-fn88">88</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This principle of rectification (<em>paṭikamma</em>) is a way of applying the
law of kamma for spiritual development. One develops one’s intentional
conduct at least to the extent of making amends for past misdeeds so
that one’s future actions are improved and bad actions are replaced by
good actions. One does not sit by idly due to a fear of generating
kamma, as is espoused by the doctrine of the Nigaṇṭhā. And very
importantly, after making mistakes, one does not fret, bemoan, get
depressed, or get caught up in the past, which only compounds
unwholesome tendencies, leads to missed opportunities, and increases
suffering.</p>
<p>Having made mistakes, one recognizes them for what they are. One does
not get caught up in or immobilized by the emotions of distress or
remorse. Rather, one seeks knowledge and relies on wisdom. Having
recognized one’s faults, one determines to rectify them or to make
amends. This accords with the principles praised by the Buddha. It also
accords with the principle of heedfulness (<em>appamāda</em>). Rectification
(<em>paṭikamma</em>) supports heedfulness, which is a key spiritual factor
leading to spiritual growth and perfection.</p>
<p>The following verses by the Buddha in the Dhammapada complement this
subject of redemption and rectification. The same verses were uttered by
Ven. Aṅgulimāla while enjoying the bliss of liberation after he was
’reborn’ in the noble discipline by realizing the fruit of arahantship:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever was heedless before and afterwards is not; such a one
illumines this world like the moon freed from clouds.</p>
<p>Whoever cancels out evil deeds by way of wholesome deeds; such a one
illumines this world like the moon freed from clouds.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn89-1"><a href="#fn-fn89">89</a></sup> {292}</p>

<h3 id="kamma-leading-to-the-end-of-kamma"><a class="header" href="#kamma-leading-to-the-end-of-kamma">Kamma Leading to the End of Kamma</a></h3>
<p>One of the earlier classifications of kamma (see above) divides kamma
into four kinds, according to the relationship between actions and their
results:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn90-1"><a href="#fn-fn90">90</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dark actions with dark results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bright actions with bright results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actions both dark and bright, with results both dark and bright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actions neither dark nor bright, with results neither dark nor
bright, and conducive to the end of kamma.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, the descriptions of the fruits of kamma have been restricted to
the first three kinds of kamma listed above, which can be simply defined
as ’good and bad kamma’. There remains thus the fourth kind of kamma.</p>
<p>Because the fruition of kamma in terms of this fourth factor is entirely
different from the first three kinds, it needs to be distinguished.</p>
<p>Many people, including Buddhists themselves, express an interest only in
the first three kinds of kamma and neglect the fourth kind, even though
this final factor is an essential Buddhist principle that leads to the
true goal of Buddha-Dhamma.</p>
<p>Bright and dark kamma, or good and bad kamma, manifests in myriad forms,
which can be classified within the framework of the ten wholesome and
unwholesome paths of action (<em>kusala-</em> and <em>akusala-kammapatha</em>), e.g.:
destroying life, stealing, sexual misconduct, harmful or malicious
speech, etc., along with the opposite wholesome forms of action. Such
actions cause people to reap the various positive and negative fruits
described earlier. They determine people’s way of life, prompting them
to perform further wholesome and unwholesome deeds and to revolve in the
wheel of rebirth (<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>).</p>
<p>Fruition associated with the fourth kind of kamma is diametrically
opposed to that of the first three kinds. That is, it is volitional
action that does not lead to an accumulation of kamma in the future.
This kind of kamma leads to the end of kamma, to a freedom from kamma,
to the cessation of kamma. It does not produce more kamma.</p>
<p>Kamma leading to the end of kamma refers to actions in harmony with
those principles bringing about a realization of the highest goal of
Buddha-Dhamma. From the perspective of the Four Noble Truths this refers
to the fourth noble truth, i.e. the Eightfold Path, but one may equally
describe it by other formats, say the seven factors of enlightenment
(<em>bojjhaṅga</em>) or the threefold training of moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>),
concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).</p>
<p>Occasionally, this fourth kind of kamma is described in relation to the
other three kinds, as the intention to abandon these three. This refers
to those actions accompanied by an intention to bring about the
non-arising of these three former kinds of kamma. In regard to ’root
cause’, this refers to those actions springing from non-greed
(<em>alobha</em>), non-hatred (<em>adosa</em>), and non-delusion (<em>amoha</em>).</p>
<p>A discussion of kamma is often connected to the subject of pleasure
(<em>sukha</em>; ’happiness’) and pain (<em>dukkha</em>; ’suffering’), because
intentional actions bear fruit as pleasure or pain. As long as there is
kamma, one must spin around in the vortex of pleasure and pain. {293}
Any state intermingled by pleasure and pain is not free from suffering
and is thus by definition not the supreme, flawless state. In sum, kamma
is linked to suffering and is a cause for suffering.</p>
<p>In any case, this preceding paragraph refers specifically to the first
three kinds of kamma. The fourth kind of kamma is an exception, because
it is kamma leading to the end of kamma.</p>
<p>Good kamma bears fruit as happiness, but this happiness is mixed up with
suffering and may be a cause for suffering. The fourth kind of kamma
leads to a complete freedom from suffering. Moreover, while one performs
this fourth kind of kamma, one does not experience suffering. On the
contrary, one experiences a full and genuine form of happiness.</p>
<p>Other religious traditions at the time of the Buddha, in particular the
doctrine of the Nigaṇṭhas, also contain teachings on the end of kamma.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the Nigaṇṭhas teaches the principles of past kamma
(<em>pubbekata-vāda</em>), of the destruction of kamma (<em>karma-kshaya</em>), and of
causing oneself hardship through extreme ascetic practices (<em>tapa</em>;
<em>tapo-kamma</em>).</p>
<p>If one is unable to clearly distinguish these three principles from
Buddhist teachings, there will arise confusion and misunderstanding. But
if one is able to make this distinction, one will gain a clearer
understanding of Buddha-Dhamma.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the Nigaṇṭhas is as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever a person feels, whether pleasure or pain or
neither-pleasure-nor-pain, all that is caused by what was done in the
past. So by annihilating with asceticism past actions and by doing no
fresh actions, there will be no consequence in the future. With no
consequence in the future, there is the destruction of action. With
the destruction of action, there is the destruction of suffering. With
the destruction of suffering, there is the destruction of feeling.
With the destruction of feeling, all suffering will be exhausted. Such
is the doctrine, such is the view, of the Nigaṇṭhas.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 92-3; M. II. 214; A. I. 220-21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Nigaṇṭhas believed that everything one experiences is a result of
past kamma. In order to bring suffering to an end, one must destroy all
kamma by burning away mental defilements through extreme ascetic
practices. In this fashion, previous kamma is dispelled. Moreover, one
must refrain from creating any new kamma.</p>
<p>Buddhism, on the contrary, teaches that previous kamma is one factor in
a causal process. One must understand this process as it truly is in
order for one’s spiritual practice to proceed well. The end of suffering
is possible by way of action, yet this action must be correct. It is
kamma leading to the end of kamma.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate kamma, instead of remaining idle or passive,
Buddhist practitioners must persevere and make determined and diligent
effort. This effort is accompanied by wisdom, which leads to a freedom
from the power of craving and ignorance.</p>
<p>Here are the main attributes of kamma leading to the end of kamma: {294}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is the path leading to the cessation of kamma
(<em>kammanirodhagāminī-paṭipadā</em>). Although it leads to the end of
kamma, it is itself one form of kamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is referred to as neither dark nor bright (or neither white nor
black); its results also are neither dark nor bright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It originates from non-greed (<em>alobha</em>), non-hatred (<em>adosa</em>), and
non-delusion (<em>amoha</em>). By its very nature it prevents evil actions,
because it is free from any causes or conditions leading to serious
wrongdoing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is accompanied by wisdom and understanding, which discerns the
true benefits and harm of things. It is a virtuous and reasoned form
of action, which enhances one’s life and is conducive to wellbeing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a truly wholesome and favourable form of action, because
effort, mindfulness, and wisdom act as supporting factors and
directly conduct the activities. There is no opportunity for craving
to spur people into selfishly harming others or to prevent people
from acting due to an attachment to personal pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is wholesome action referred to as ’transcendent wholesomeness’
(<em>lokuttara-kusala</em>). The commentaries refer to it as ’Path
intention’ (<em>magga-cetanā</em>) or ’Path knowledge (<em>magga-ñāṇa</em>). It is
called kamma leading to the end of kamma because it brings about the
non-production or non-generation of kamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In terms of formal principles of Dhamma practice, this kamma refers
to the Eightfold Path – the fourth noble truth – which leads to
the cessation of suffering (<em>dukkhanirodhagāminī-paṭipadā</em>).
According to the circumstances, however, it may also be referred to
by other terms, e.g. the seven factors of enlightenment
(<em>bojjhaṅga</em>) or the threefold training, or by such general terms as
’intention for abandoning the three (former) kinds of kamma’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In regard to item 5., note that many people harbour the misunderstanding
that craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) is solely a motivating force for action: the
greater a person’s craving, the the more he or she will act with a sense
of urgency. If one has no craving, one will be devoid of a motivation to
act. One will remain idle and perhaps fall into laziness.</p>
<p>This misunderstanding results from an incomplete view of human nature.
It can create serious damage, for oneself, for society, and for one’s
natural environment.</p>
<p>In fact, craving is a motivation for both action and inaction. It is a
motivating force for action in the case that one seeks sense objects for
selfish gratification. In such cases, there tends to be competition and
conflict between people, causing harm and distress for society.</p>
<p>But in those circumstances in which one should act for the sake of
goodness, or for the sake of personal or social welfare, but whereby one
does not obtain things for personal gratification, craving is a
motivation for inaction. This is because craving leads to an infatuation
in sensual delight and enjoyment. Even an excessive delight in sleeping
or other forms of self-indulgence hinder one from performing appropriate
actions. Craving here is a cause for laziness. And the greater one’s
ignorance – one’s failure to understand the value and benefits of
specific actions – the more that craving will lead to idleness and
apathy.</p>
<p>In sum, craving is either a motivation for harmful actions or a
motivation for indolence and inertia, depending on the means by which
one’s gratification and pleasure is rewarded and satisfied. {295}</p>
<p>Actions that enhance the quality of life or increase true wellbeing are
distinct from the enjoyment or attachment to sense gratification, and
indeed they often require a relinquishment of personal pleasure. Such
actions do not stem from craving (unless one has established secondary
preconditions). Rather, they spring from wisdom, which discerns the true
value of such actions, and which generates a delight for performing
them.</p>
<p>The delight or desire for action here is referred to in Pali as <em>chanda</em>
(in full, it is called ’wholesome desire’ – <em>kusala-chanda</em>, or ’desire
for truth’ – <em>dhamma-chanda</em>). <em>Chanda</em> is the true motivation for
those actions enhancing the quality of life or increasing wellbeing.</p>
<p>Actions impelled by wholesome desire, however, may be impeded or offset
by craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), which indulges in inertia or becomes infatuated by
objects of sensual gratification. Under such circumstances craving leads
to suffering, because many of one’s actions are performed with a sense
of resistance and coercion.</p>
<p>If, however, one has a clear discernment of an action’s true value, and
the strength of wholesome desire is sufficient to escape from the
obstructive force of craving, besides functioning as the motivation for
action, wholesome desire will lead to happiness. This happiness is
spacious and expansive, unlike the restricted pleasure derived from
craving. It enables one to act with joy.</p>
<p>Moreover, fully supported and guided by effort (<em>viriya</em>), mindfulness
(<em>sati</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>), one will develop concentration
(<em>samādhi</em>) in one’s activities. It is precisely this form of action
that is referred to as kamma leading to the end of kamma.</p>
<p>The dynamic of this form of action may be outlined simply in this way:
whenever one acts in line with the Eightfold Path or the seven factors
of enlightenment (or some other group of spiritual factors, depending on
the circumstances), whereby one is guided by wisdom, craving vanishes,
because it has no opportunity to function. Similarly, greed, hatred, and
delusion do not appear.</p>
<p>With the absence of craving, and divested of greed, hatred and delusion,
there are no volitional actions that produce negative repercussions for
one’s life. Without such negative repercussions one is free from
suffering. Whereas formerly one was enslaved by the dictates of craving,
now one’s life is guided by wisdom and one develops self-mastery and
true independence.</p>
<p>For further clarity, here are some passages by the Buddha on the topic
of kamma leading to the end of kamma:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, kamma should be understood; the source and origin of kamma
should be understood; the diversity of kamma should be understood; the
result of kamma should be understood; the cessation of kamma should be
understood; the way leading to the cessation of kamma should be
understood….</p>
<p>It is volition, monks, that I call kamma. For having willed, one acts
by body, speech, or mind.</p>
<p>And what is the source and origin of kamma? Contact (<em>phassa</em>) is its
source and origin.</p>
<p>And what is the diversity of kamma? There is kamma the results of
which are to be experienced in hell; there is kamma the results of
which are to be experienced in the animal realm; there is kamma the
results of which are to be experienced in the realm of afflicted
spirits; there is kamma the results of which are to be experienced in
the human world; there is kamma the results of which are to be
experienced in the deva world. This is called the diversity of kamma.
{296}</p>
<p>And what is the result of kamma? The result of kamma, I say, is
threefold: [to be experienced] in this very life, or in the [next]
rebirth, or on a subsequent occasion. This is called the result of
kamma.</p>
<p>And what is the cessation of kamma? With the cessation of contact
there is cessation of kamma. This Noble Eightfold Path is the way
leading to the cessation of kamma, namely, right view … right
concentration.</p>
<p>When, monks, a noble disciple thus clearly understands kamma, the
source and origin of kamma, the diversity of kamma, the result of
kamma, the cessation of kamma, and the way leading to the cessation of
kamma, he understands the holy life endowed with penetrative wisdom to
be the cessation of kamma.</p>
<p><em>A. III. 415.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, I will teach you new and old kamma, the cessation of kamma, and
the way leading to the cessation of kamma….</p>
<p>And what is old kamma? The eye … ear … nose … tongue … body
… mind is old kamma, fashioned by conditioning factors, generated by
volition, a locus of sensation. This is called old kamma.</p>
<p>And what, monks, is new kamma? Whatever action one does now by body,
speech, or mind. This is called new kamma.</p>
<p>And what, monks, is the cessation of kamma? When one reaches
liberation through the cessation of bodily action, verbal action, and
mental action, this is called the cessation of kamma.</p>
<p>And what, monks, is the way leading to the cessation of kamma? It is
this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view … right
concentration. This is called the way leading to the cessation of
kamma.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 132-3.</em></p>
<p>Monks, this body is not yours, nor does it belong to others. It is to
be seen as old kamma, created by conditioning factors, generated by
volition, a locus of sensation.</p>
<p><em>S. II. 65.</em></p>
<p>Monks, there are these three causes for the origination of kamma. What
three? Greed … hatred … delusion is a cause for the origination of
kamma. Any kamma performed through greed, born of greed, caused by
greed, originated by greed, ripens wherever the individual is reborn.
Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its
result, either in this very life, or in the [next] rebirth, or on
some subsequent occasion. Any kamma performed through hatred …
through delusion, ripens wherever the individual is reborn. Wherever
that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences its result….</p>
<p>Monks, there are these three [other] causes for the origination of
kamma. What three? Non-greed … non-hatred … non-delusion is a
cause for the origination of kamma. Any kamma performed through
non-greed, born of non-greed, caused by non-greed, originated by
non-greed, is abandoned when greed has vanished; it is cut off at the
root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is no more
subject to future arising. Any kamma performed through non-hatred …
through non-delusion, is abandoned when delusion has vanished; it is
cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that it is
no more subject to future arising. {297}</p>
<p><em>A. I. 134-5.</em></p>
<p>Monks, there are these three causes for the origination of kamma. What
three? Greed … hatred … delusion…. Any kamma performed through
greed, born of greed, caused by greed, originated by greed, is
unwholesome and harmful and results in suffering. That kamma leads to
the origination of kamma, not to the cessation of kamma. Any kamma
performed through hatred … through delusion … leads to the
origination of kamma….</p>
<p>Monks, there are these three [other] causes for the origination of
kamma. What three? Non-greed … non-hatred … non-delusion…. Any
kamma performed through non-greed, born of non-greed, caused by
non-greed, originated by non-greed, is wholesome and beneficial and
results in happiness. That kamma leads to the cessation of kamma, not
to the origination of kamma. Any kamma performed through non-hatred
… through non-delusion … leads to the cessation of kamma….</p>
<p><em>A. I. 263; see two similar suttas at: A. I. 264 and A. III. 338-9.</em></p>
<p>Monks, the destruction of life, I say, is threefold: caused by greed,
caused by hatred, and caused by delusion. Taking what is not given …
sexual misconduct … false speech … divisive speech … harsh
speech … idle chatter … covetousness … ill-will … wrong view,
I say, is also threefold: caused by greed, caused by hatred, and
caused by delusion.</p>
<p>Thus, greed is a source and origin of kamma; hatred is a source and
origin of kamma; delusion is a source and origin of kamma. With the
destruction of greed, a source of kamma is extinguished. With the
destruction of hatred, a source of kamma is extinguished. With the
destruction of delusion, a source of kamma is extinguished.</p>
<p><em>A. V. 261-2.</em></p>
<p>Puṇṇa, there are four kinds of action proclaimed by me after realizing
them for myself with direct knowledge. What are the four? There is
dark action with dark result; there is bright action with bright
result; there is dark-and-bright action with dark-and-bright result;
and there is action that is neither dark nor bright with
neither-dark-nor-bright result, action that leads to the destruction
of action.</p>
<p>And what, Puṇṇa, is dark action with dark result? Here someone
generates an afflictive bodily formation, an afflictive verbal
formation, an afflictive mental formation. Having generated an
afflictive bodily formation … he reappears in an afflictive world.
When he has reappeared in an afflictive world, afflictive contacts
touch him. Being touched by afflictive contact, he feels afflictive
feelings, extremely painful, as in the case of the beings in hell.</p>
<p>On this account, a being’s rebirth is due to previous actions; one is
reborn through the actions one has performed. When one has reappeared,
contacts touch one. Thus I say that beings are the heirs of their
actions. This is called dark action with dark result.</p>
<p>And what, Puṇṇa, is bright action with bright result? Here someone
generates an unafflictive bodily formation, an unafflictive verbal
formation, an unafflictive mental formation. Having generated an
unafflictive bodily formation … he reappears in an unafflictive
world. When he has reappeared in an unafflictive world, unafflictive
contacts touch him. Being touched by unafflictive contact, he feels
unafflictive feelings, extremely pleasant, as in the case of the Gods
of Refulgent Glory. {298}</p>
<p>On this account, a being’s rebirth is due to previous actions; one is
reborn through the actions one has performed. When one has reappeared,
contacts touch one. Thus I say that beings are the heirs of their
actions. This is called bright action with bright result.</p>
<p>And what, Puṇṇa, is dark-and-bright action with dark-and-bright
result? Here someone generates a bodily formation … a verbal
formation … a mental formation that is both afflictive and
unafflictive. Having generated a bodily formation … that is both
afflictive and unafflictive he reappears in a world that is both
afflictive and unafflictive. When he has reappeared in a world that is
both afflictive and unafflictive, both afflictive and unafflictive
contacts touch him. Being touched by both afflictive and unafflictive
contacts, he feels both afflictive and unafflictive feelings, mingled
pleasure and pain, as in the case of human beings and some gods and
some beings in the lower worlds.</p>
<p>On this account, a being’s rebirth is due to previous actions; one is
reborn through the actions one has performed. When one has reappeared,
contacts touch one. Thus I say that beings are the heirs of their
actions. This is called dark-and-bright action with dark-and-bright
result.</p>
<p>And what, Puṇṇa, is action that is neither dark nor bright with
neither-dark-nor-bright result, action that leads to the destruction
of action? In regard to those three kinds of actions, the volition in
abandoning action that is dark with dark result, the volition in
abandoning action that is bright with bright result, and the volition
in abandoning action that is dark and bright with dark-and-bright
result: this is called action that is neither dark nor bright with
neither-dark-nor-bright result, action that leads to the destruction

factor of investigation of Dhamma, the enlightenment factor of effort,
the enlightenment factor of rapture, the enlightenment factor of
tranquillity, the enlightenment factor of concentration, and the
enlightenment factor of equanimity …</p>
<p><em>A. II. 236-7.</em></p>
<p>Here, Udāyī, a monk develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness
… the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon
seclusion, dispassion, and cessation; which is vast, exalted,
measureless, free from oppression. When he develops the enlightenment
factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity,
craving is abandoned. With the abandoning of craving, kamma is
abandoned. With the abandoning of kamma, suffering is abandoned. Thus,
with the destruction of craving comes the destruction of kamma; with
the destruction of kamma comes the destruction of suffering.</p>

<h3 id="social-or-collective-kamma"><a class="header" href="#social-or-collective-kamma">Social or Collective Kamma</a></h3>
<p>People often pose the question whether social or collective kamma
exists. Some people claim that kamma is restricted to an individual; the
kamma generated by an individual pertains only to that person: the
person who sows the seed, reaps the fruit. Kamma therefore only exists
on an individual level; it is a private matter. In sum, social or
collective kamma does not exist. Holding to such a view, however, may be
a form of delusion.</p>
<p>When faced with such questions it is not always necessary to answer them
directly. Sometimes, it suffices to share specific principles on this
subject with the questioners, and thus allow them to dispel their own
doubts.</p>
<p>What is kamma? As most students of Buddhism are aware, kamma is action,
specifically action generated by intention (<em>cetanā</em>). Indeed, the
Buddha stated that kamma <em>is</em> intention (or intention <em>is</em> kamma).</p>
<p>In terms of the individual, whoever performs kamma – whoever is the
owner of a volitional deed – experiences its fruit, the results of
intention. From this perspective, kamma is an individual matter. If red
dye is added to a glass of water, the water is red; if green dye is
added to another glass, the water is green. The two glasses are clearly
separate from one another.</p>
<p>Human beings are distinct from material objects found in nature, insofar
as they perform volitional actions. All human affairs and occupations –
building, agriculture, crafts, tailoring, etc. – are a consequence of
human intention. They follow the volitional designs of human beings.</p>
<p>Collectively, the myriad activities and enterprises performed by human
beings are referred to as human society or the human world. Human
society comprises the world of human volitional activity, directed and
determined by intention. The human world is thus a world of kamma. {300}</p>
<p>In brief, kamma is a matter pertaining to human beings; human matters
are equivalent to kamma. Individual kamma does exist, yet when one
examines kamma from a broader perspective, kamma pertains to all human
activities and is the catalyst for the formation of human society.
Generally speaking, one need not differentiate the kamma of individual
people and the kamma of society, or to distinguish between kamma on the
personal level and kamma on the social level. Instead of making that
distinction, one should distinguish kamma, all of which pertains to
human beings, from matters dealing with material objects, the natural
environment, trees and plants, etc.</p>
<p>Although each person leads an individual life, the very engagement and
interaction with others is the basis for society. Similarly, although
everyone performs individual kamma, when people live together and
perform volitional actions towards, or in collaboration with, others, a
specific kind of social kamma is created. When viewing kamma in this
broad sense, one sees that it encompasses both individual human beings
all the way up to the entire human society. For this reason, except for
the purpose of unique considerations, it is unnecessary to distinguish
between individual and social kamma.</p>
<p>Take the example of a village in which the residents are farmers and
sustain a decent living by work in the fields. One day a gambler skilled
at cock-fighting visits the village and displays his craft. He drums up
interest in others, encouraging them to engage in cock-fighting. This is
his own intentional action, and he will receive the fruits of acting in
this way. Here, the perspective is on the individual level. A further
analysis reveals that before long almost every head of the household in
this village adopts this new activity, delighting in the joys of
cock-fighting, and they neglect their work. Each individual who acts in
this way likewise receives the fruits of his or her intentional actions.</p>
<p>A broader perspective of the entire village, however, reveals the
collective fruit of a change in lifestyle among a large portion of the
villagers, including an increase in alcohol consumption and theft. The
entire fortune of the village, even including the physical environment,
undergoes an alteration as a consequence of these actions.</p>
<p>By examining this series of events one is able to distinguish between
those matters pertaining to an individual and those pertaining to the
community as a whole. In terms of the formal teachings, a broader
perspective reveals how the set of conditions (<em>paccayākāra</em>) are
naturally interconnected.</p>
<p>Many Buddhists may have heard the Pali adage: <em>kammunā vattatī loko</em>,
which may be translated as ’the world turns by way of kamma’. It is
important to understand the deeper meaning of this teaching. The ’world’
here refers to human society. Let us examine how the human world
proceeds according to kamma.</p>
<p>This passage is found in the Vāseṭṭha Sutta, in which the Buddha teaches
the principle of kamma in order to repudiate the caste system of the
brahmins.</p>
<p>The brahmins held the doctrine that the God Brahma created the world and
set up a definitive social system for human beings, determining the
division into the four castes, of <em>khattiya</em> (kings, rulers), <em>brāhmaṇa</em>
(brahmins), <em>vessa</em> (merchants, traders), and <em>sudda</em> (manual workers).
Having been born into one of these social classes, one had to remain in
that class for the rest of one’s life; there was no way to alter one’s
status.</p>
<p>The Buddha refuted this doctrine, stating that the world of human beings
proceeds according to kamma. He emphasized those intentional actions
that are performed on a regular basis, becoming the ingrained way of
life of an individual or the tradition of a community. This refers in
particular to people’s work or profession (in Pali the term ’kamma’
often refers to an occupation or profession).</p>
<p>People’s work and occupations are precisely what is meant by the term
kamma in the phrase ’the world turns by way of kamma’. The world of
human beings does not follow the dictates of the God Brahma, nor is it
predetermined in any sort of unyielding or inflexible way. The world
turns as a consequence of the work and activities intentionally chosen
and undertaken by human beings themselves. {301}</p>
<p>Although the Vāseṭṭha Sutta has been cited in other chapters of
<em>Buddhadhamma</em>, the subject material under discussion was different.
Here are the passages relevant to this context:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Look here, Vāseṭṭha, you should know that he who makes his living
among men by tending cattle is called a farmer; he is not a
brahmin…. Whoever makes his living by varied crafts is called a
craftsman…. Whoever makes his living by trade is called a
merchant…. Whoever makes his living by serving others is called a
servant…. Whoever makes his living by stealing is called a
robber…. Whoever makes his living by archery and swordsmanship is
called a soldier…. Whoever makes his living by priestly craft is
called a chaplain; he is not a brahmin…. Whoever governs the town
and realm is called a ruler; he is not a brahmin…. He who harbours
no residual defilements, who clings no more, he is the one I call a
brahmin….</p>
<p>One is not a brahmin by birth. By action is one a brahmin; by action
is one a non-brahmin. For people are farmers by their actions (kamma;
’work’, ’occupation’, ’behaviour’); by their actions are people
craftsmen, merchants, servants, robbers, soldiers, chaplains, and
rulers too. The truly wise, seers of Dependent Origination, skilled in
action and its results, see action as it really is. Kamma makes the
world go round; kamma makes this generation turn.</p>
<p><em>M. II. 196; Sn. 117-23.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In sum, according to the Buddhist teachings, human society manifests and
proceeds according to people’s work and occupations and the way in which
people live their lives. It is not ultimately dependent on a caste
system based on one’s birth and family, which the brahmins claim was
prescribed and created by Brahma.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the principle of kamma is one aspect to the
teaching on Dependent Origination. In the chapter on Dependent
Origination, it was mentioned how the Buddha described a mode of
conditionality (<em>paccayākāra</em>) in terms of how social problems
originate. One can label this process ’Dependent Origination in regard
to social affliction’.</p>
<p>The problem of individual suffering and the problems of society are all
problems linked to, or arising as result of, human beings; they are
interconnected and part of a whole. Individual problems spread outwards,
creating social problems, which may then turn around and intensify
individual problems. Therefore, the scriptures do not emphasize a
distinction between these various kinds of kammic processes.</p>
<p>Of the three kinds of kamma – physical, verbal, and mental kamma – the
Buddha stated that mental kamma produces the greatest consequences. And
of all the factors of mental kamma, the one given special emphasis is
’view’ (<em>diṭṭhi</em>), namely, a person’s way of thinking, belief system,
opinions, ideology, religious beliefs, ideals, etc.</p>
<p>An example of the impact views have on society is that religious and
spiritual leaders have been able to create revolutionary events and
changes throughout history by proclaiming their ideas, causing others to
endorse, undertake, practise, and spread these teachings.</p>
<p>The driving force behind every society and civilization is a collection
of views and beliefs. And the fortunes, both positive and negative, of
human societies are a consequence of such mental kamma performed by
people living in these societies.</p>
<p>The following passage by the Buddha confirms the juxtaposition of how
views are volitional actions arising in the mind, while at the same time
having a tremendous bearing on society and the world: {302}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there is one person who arises in the world for the harm of
many people, for the unhappiness of many people, for the ruin, harm,
and suffering of many people, of devas and human beings. Who is that
one person? It is one who holds wrong view and has an incorrect
perspective. He draws many people away from the true Dhamma and
establishes them in a false Dhamma. This is that one person who arises
in the world for the harm of many people, the unhappiness of many
people, for the ruin, harm, and suffering of many people, of devas and
human beings.</p>
<p>Monks, there is one person who arises in the world for the welfare of
many people, for the happiness of many people, for the good, welfare,
and happiness of many people, of devas and human beings. Who is that
one person? It is one who holds right view and has a correct
perspective. He draws many people away from a false Dhamma and
establishes them in the true Dhamma. This is that one person who
arises in the world for the welfare of many people, the happiness of
many people, for the good, welfare, and happiness of many people, of
devas and human beings.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 33.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In general terms, one may judge religious leaders, intellectuals,
politicians, etc., who influence society through sharing their ideas, by
the fruits of their actions, using the standard found in the Buddha’s
description of the attributes of a ’great man’ (<em>mahā-purisa</em>): ’He is
practising for the welfare and happiness of many people; he is one who
has established many people in the noble way, of being endowed with
wholesome and virtuous qualities.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn93-1"><a href="#fn-fn93">93</a></sup> This corresponds with the
frequently cited Buddhist maxim: ’act for the welfare and happiness of
the manyfolk, for the compassionate assistance of the world’
(<em>bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya lokānukampāya</em>).</p>
<p>To reiterate, kamma is a matter pertaining to human beings. All other
matters related to human beings, including those dynamics present in the
human mind, involve other laws of nature and similarly proceed according
to causes and conditions. But it is precisely kamma – volitional
thoughts, speech, and actions – that is a unique and inherent quality
of the human state of existence. One can say that human life is
characterized by volitional actions (<em>kamma</em>).</p>
<p>The expression ’social kamma’ or ’collective kamma’ may be misleading.
It is more apt to say ’human kamma’, and then to distinguish between
kamma dealing with an individual and kamma dealing with society, or
kamma bearing fruit for an individual and kamma extending outwards and
creating specific social conditions.</p>
<p>The most important matters affecting society are those actions performed
by individuals when relating and associating to one another. The
circumstances of individuals, or of society as a whole, are a
consequence of people’s volitional actions. People’s thoughts, speech,
and actions condition human society. The world turns because of kamma.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the essence of kamma is intention. The world is
thus shaped and moulded by human intention. A primary form of
intentional activity on the social level, guided by human intelligence,
is the establishment of conventional rules – a form of mutual agreement
– in order to assist with social engagements and relationships. {303}</p>
<p>With wisdom guiding intention, human beings are able to participate as a
vital factor in the natural, causal process, in order to alter the
course of events in a way that fits with their desires. This
participation is particularly effective in the context of establishing a
system of social conventions, which lie at the heart of any society.</p>
<p>Here, wisdom has an understanding of Dhamma – the truth of nature or
the laws of nature. Intention, the key factor of the law of kamma,
applies this understanding to formulate a system of social conventions
(<em>vinaya</em>). The society receives the fruits of these volitional actions,
according to the level of wisdom and the quality of the mind inherent in
those who formulate these conventions. This is the link between the laws
of nature and human conventions, in particular the link between the law
of kamma (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>) and conventional laws (<em>sammati-niyāma</em>). A
true civilization is only created when people are able to understand and
reach this balance between the truth (Dhamma) and conventional
prescriptions (<em>vinaya</em>).</p>
<p>Among public officials entrusted with specific social duties, there may
be those who seek out personal advantage and profit. Other people may
live out their lives outside of any formally appointed public position,
yet be fully dedicated to the welfare of society. If one understands the
principle of kamma, one will be able to distinguish in these cases which
matters pertain to individual kamma and which to social kamma.</p>
<h3 id="kamma-in-the-context-of-conventional-laws"><a class="header" href="#kamma-in-the-context-of-conventional-laws">Kamma in the Context of Conventional Laws</a></h3>
<p>When people live together, forming communities and societies, it is
necessary for there to be a system of communication. Human beings draw
on their ingenuity to establish units or means of shared understanding,
which they collectively acknowledge, uphold, and apply.</p>
<p>These shared and agreed-upon conventions are essential for any society
to thrive and to reach a stage one may refer to as a ’culture’ or
’civilization’. In other words, every true civilization is based on such
conventions.</p>
<p>A primary and vital form of convention pertains to speech, enabling
people to communicate with one another. This gives rise to words and
languages, which act as the medium for exchanging ideas. Based on these
conventions of speech is another layer of social prescriptions, i.e. the
act of naming things.</p>
<p>Besides the conventions of speech and nomenclature, people also set down
prescriptions dealing with shared activities and actions, resulting in
rules and regulations, laws, codes of discipline, and guidelines for
behaviour.</p>
<p>And aside from these agreed-upon conventions dealing with common actions
and activities, there are further prescriptions attending to the
question of what society should do when someone transgresses the rules,
regulations, etc. These are matters to do with administrative power and
punishment.</p>
<p>In order for these agreed-upon prescriptions to be truly effective,
certain individuals are appointed and supervisory systems established to
ensure that the rules and regulations are obeyed. This is how governance
and administration is created.</p>
<p>In order for the various conventions, both in regard to speech
(including formal designations) and to actions, to truly function as
they were intended and to exist as an integrated unit, a form of
maintenance and management is required. Such an integrated system is
referred to as ’vinaya’.</p>
<p>The meaning of the term <em>vinaya</em> encompasses the establishment of
conventions, the management of affairs in accord with conventions, say
by maintaining a code of discipline, and the setting down of rules in
accord with these conventions. {304}</p>
<p>The term <em>vinaya</em> thus has three layers of meaning: first, the
establishment of a code of living or a system for regulating human
activities; second, the specific data or subject material stipulating or
defining suitable and unsuitable behaviour contained in such codes or
systems; and third, the supervision and management of behaviour so that
it accords with such codes or systems.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, conventional forms and structures lie at the heart
of human societies and act to define them. A code of discipline
(<em>vinaya</em>) helps to accomplish the objectives of society and to fulfil
the advantages of a chosen set of conventions. Therefore, on a basic
level, a code of discipline supports conventions and safeguards society.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, however, it is important to realize that such codes
of discipline do not merely exist to control people, to maintain peace
and order, or to ensure that people act in conformity with established
forms and structures. These codes should be used to provide people with
an opportunity to improve their lives. They should promote the mutual
support and assistance among people, and to enable society to be a
conducive venue for spiritual development for everyone.</p>
<p>Note that social conventions, and the regulatory codes truly giving form
to such conventions, are created by human beings and may thus be
imprecise and even flawed. The reason that they may not be flawed –
that they are grounded in truth – is because they are linked to
essential realities at a deeper level acting as a foundation.</p>
<p>What are these essential realities acting as a foundation? They are
those natural phenomena – things that exist in nature – which in Pali
are referred to as <em>dhamma</em>.</p>
<p>This term <em>dhamma</em> has a broad, all-inclusive meaning. In this context
it may refer to all natural phenomena (also referred to as <em>sabhāva</em> or
<em>sabhāva-dhamma</em>); or it may refer to systems and structures inherent in
nature – to laws of nature.</p>
<p>It is precisely these real and actual phenomena that are the essence of
human conventions; they act as the reference points and give meaning to
such conventions. Without these reference points, human conventions are
faulty and effectively futile.</p>
<p>The laws of nature governing such phenomena – the systems of
interrelated causes and conditions – are a foundation for the codes of
conduct (<em>vinaya</em>) established by human societies. If these codes,
social systems, and structures are incongruous with the causes and
effects inherent in these natural processes – these laws of nature –
they will be flawed and are bound to come to naught.</p>
<p>Human beings require an access to the essential truths inherent in
nature and the true benefits provided by laws of nature. The purpose of
establishing conventions and setting down systems of conduct, either
knowingly or unknowingly, is to meet these objectives.</p>
<p>A very simple example for this is of a doctor, who instructs the son or
daughter of a sick man to return home with the patient, saying:
’Everyday, prepare a pitcher containing a litre and a half of distilled
water for your father to drink.’ {305}</p>
<p>Here we see a social convention (of language) pointing to a truth
inherent in nature (a cure for the illness), and a disciplined system (a
medicinal treatment plan) enabling people to benefit both from social
conventions and from a system of interrelated conditions linked to
various laws of nature. The greater is one’s wisdom, the deeper is one’s
penetrative insight into how these various factors are interconnected.</p>
<p>If one is endowed with wisdom, clearly discerning the interrelationship
of various conditions, one’s efforts will thus increasingly lead to
success.</p>
<p>Here, we may outline two connected systems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A natural system established in accord with natural laws. Whether
human beings exist or not, or are aware of this system or not, it
exists ’just so’. In brief, one may call this system ’Dhamma’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A conventional human system created in order for society to be in
harmony with and to benefit from nature and the laws of nature. In
brief, one may call this system ’vinaya’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The human conventional system (<em>vinaya</em>) must be firmly based on the
system of nature (Dhamma) in order for it to be genuine and effective.</p>
<p>In this sense, the Dhamma is both the foundation and the purpose of the
<em>vinaya</em>. Human laws must be established on and be in harmony with
natural laws in order for people to profit from the laws of nature.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, human society functions by way of conventions
(<em>sammati</em>), forms based on mutual consent and approval, that allow for
effective communication and management. The <em>vinaya</em> refers to
formulating a system to effectively regulate social activities.</p>
<p>Mutually agreed-upon conventions require social unity and concord
(<em>sāmaggī</em>), enabling people to accept, endorse, and follow the
prescribed rules and regulations. Social unity is a foundation for
social conventions. Devoid of such concord and unity, these conventions
are unsound and the society in question is unstable.</p>
<p>Without social concord, some people will reject the conventions. For
instance, people will not respect the proprietary rights of others, the
rights of others in legal disputes, the rights of other factions or
groups of people, and the rules and laws of society. This leads to
social turmoil and unrest, and may even lead to the demise of society.</p>
<p>Social concord is a foundation for codes of conduct (<em>vinaya</em>), a
guarantee for social conventions, and a support for society. Over and
above that, concord and harmony enables society to fulfil its potential,
of having each individual provide support to others, and of being a
conducive environment for all people to develop themselves and to attain
greater blessings. {306}</p>
<p>Particularly in those communal systems or forms of governance in which
all members have a participatory role, for example in the Buddhist
monastic sangha and in state democracies, social harmony, concord, and
unison lie at the heart of such systems. In this respect, the Buddha
gave great emphasis to sangha harmony (<em>saṅgha-sāmaggī</em>), which must be
paired with a secure monastic discipline (<em>vinaya</em>).</p>
<p>Those people responsible for society need to know how to apply codes of
conduct skilfully in order to foster community harmony (<em>gaṇa-sāmaggī</em>).
Another responsibility of social leaders is to develop the willingness
in people to unite together in endorsing and upholding just conventions.</p>
<p>And on a deeper level, wise individuals are able to act in line with the
system of natural laws in order to achieve results. They investigate and
regulate various causes and conditions; when they acquire an ample and
integrated set of conditions, there arises a ’harmony of conditions’
(<em>paccaya-sāmaggī</em>). They realize the fruit of their aspired goal. If
the conditions are inadequate and one lacks this integration, no matter
how much effort one puts into one’s actions, they will not reach
success.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the codes of conduct (<em>vinaya</em>) need to be based on
<em>dhamma</em>, which may be defined as natural phenomena or laws of nature.
This term <em>dhamma</em>, however, may also be interpreted as ’truth’,
’righteousness’, or ’goodness’.</p>
<p>This links us back to social harmony. If social conventions, and the
codes used to manage such conventions, are neither grounded in nor
accord with Dhamma, people will quarrel with one another and lack unity,
refusing to accept these conventions. This leads to discord and schism.
If this conflict and discord is severe or widespread, it may even lead
to the destruction of that community or society.</p>
<p>This matter of social harmony is thus of vital importance. Even if
social conventions thwart the personal interests of an individual, he or
she won’t be able to validly discredit them if they are established in
righteousness.</p>
<p>If people contravene the truth inherent in nature, they will experience
adverse effects according to natural laws. If they contravene social
conventions, they will be at odds with others in society and experience
the ill-effects due to the collapse of their community.</p>
<p>When social conventions and codes of conduct are grounded in
righteousness, people realize that they should foster communal harmony
for the stability of their community or society. This is the case, for
instance, in the monastic community. Besides supporting the monastic
community and strengthening communal harmony, monks also honour the
community and give priority to communal wellbeing. Indeed, the Buddha
himself honoured the sangha.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn94-1"><a href="#fn-fn94">94</a></sup></p>
<p>The effort to strengthen one’s community is not made to boost some form
of collective identity, but rather to generate a supportive environment
for each individual to mature and flourish. {307} If the monastic
community does not develop in stability, it will not be conducive to the
prosperity and wellbeing of its members. It is for this reason that the
principles of reverence for the sangha (<em>saṅgha-gāravatā</em>) and sangha
harmony (<em>saṅgha-sāmaggī</em>) are given such importance.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, codes of conduct (<em>vinaya</em>) are based on laws of
nature (<em>dhamma</em>), yet these two factors are distinguished from one
another. The Dhamma refers to truths inherent in nature, whereas the
term <em>vinaya</em> refers to human conventions. Codes of conduct apply social
conventions in order to support the Dhamma. One may even say that these
codes help to direct the Dhamma. And from another perspective they act
independently of the Dhamma; they need not wait for the Dhamma to be set
in motion.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let us take the example of someone who performs a
bad action. From the perspective of Dhamma, one may refer to inherent
laws of nature, i.e. the law of kamma, which dictates that this person
will naturally reap the fruits of his actions. Determined codes of
conduct (<em>vinaya</em>), however, need not wait for the Dhamma. Human laws
set down authorized forms of conduct (<em>kamma-sammati</em>), and the person
who transgresses these laws by misbehaving is called into an assembly
and punished. Here, the <em>vinaya</em> does not wait for the Dhamma, i.e. it
does not wait for the law of kamma to complete its course. These human
laws deal with this situation immediately.</p>
<p>Here, it is apt to offer a warning that there are many Buddhists who
harbour a wrong understanding on this matter. Some people even claim
that one need not respond at all to those who have done evil, because
eventually they must receive the fruits of their kamma. This is a
mistaken view. Such people lack insight into the truth and have an
incomplete understanding. They fail to understand the essence of the
Dhamma and the <em>vinaya</em>.</p>
<p>How is this true? Let us examine this matter more closely.</p>
<p>By making the distinction between a system of nature and a system of
human conventions, one may be under the impression that these are indeed
two separate systems: a world of nature and a world of human beings. In
fact, the distinction is made simply for the convenience of examining
various circumstances. Yet one should not be misled into believing that
these are indeed two separate systems.</p>
<p>A comprehensive inspection of this matter reveals that human beings are
one facet or aspect of nature. Therefore, any kind of human activity or
issue relates to nature and is included as a part of nature.</p>
<p>Human volitional actions are described as following the law of kamma
(<em>kamma-niyāma</em>), which may give the impression that this is a distinct
law. In truth, however, the law of kamma is one kind of natural law; it
is incorporated into the general law of cause and effect
(<em>dhamma-niyāma</em>) and is part of Dependent Origination
(<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>). It is distinguished simply to clarify one facet of
the natural order.</p>
<p>The distinction between Dhamma and <em>vinaya</em> is made for the sake of
convenience, when examining various stages of a natural process. Yet a
comprehensive view reveals that the system of human codes of conduct is
incorporated into the Dhamma, which is a single, large system of truth.</p>
<p>Here, we should examine just how these two systems are linked and how
they are distinguished. {308}</p>
<p>Human activity is neither random nor haphazard. It does not resemble the
branches of trees, which move and sway only when buffeted by the wind or
some external force. Human beings, in contrast, are able to move their
limbs out of an act of will. If a man were to be walking down a path and
a rotten tree limb were to accidentally fall on his head, this would be
different from someone else coming by and deliberately whacking him over
the head with a stick. Even if someone were to fall out of a tree and
accidentally hit someone else, this too would be distinguished from a
random tree limb falling down.</p>
<p>What is the difference between these various scenarios? The answer is
easy: branches, and other inanimate natural phenomena, do not willingly
perform actions, whereas people do.</p>
<p>And if one investigates further, one asks: ’What is the source of human
action?’ One’s initial response may be: ’People’s minds’. More to the
point, the source of human action is intention (<em>cetanā</em>). Intention
<em>is</em> human action; intention <em>is</em> kamma.</p>
<p>Intention (<em>cetanā</em>) refers to volition, purpose, intent: the deliberate
choice to accept or reject something, the wilful choice to act in a
particular way. Intention is the director of affairs, which induces
various motivating factors, both positive and negative, including greed,
hatred, and delusion, craving, conceit, and wrong view, and wisdom and
lovingkindness, to step forward and take an active role.</p>
<p>Everything pertaining to the world of human beings – the establishment
of conventions, the laying down of rules and legislation, allocation of
resources, production, work, politics, technology, cultural traditions,
social customs, etc. – arise by way of human action and are determined
and created by intention.</p>
<p>Human beings are one cause and condition within the natural causal
system, and intention is one factor in this process. Of all factors
within the human mind, intention plays such a pivotal role that it is
valid to say it represents the entirety of an individual person. It is
the means by which people express themselves through actions, beginning
with thoughts and then leading to speech and physical acts.</p>
<p>As intention plays such a significant role, affecting and altering
people’s circumstances in countless ways, it is recognized as comprising
a key domain in the natural causal system, worthy of special attention
and investigation. For this reason, the law of kamma (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>) is
distinguished as a subsidiary law in the wider law of nature.</p>
<p>The law of kamma pertains to human society, to the world of human
beings. Intention is the active agent behind kamma; as stated earlier,
one may say that intention <em>is</em> kamma, or kamma <em>is</em> intention.</p>
<p>All human codes of conduct (<em>vinaya</em>) as part of a system of human
conventions are established and managed by human intention. Although
these are social matters, ultimately, they are included as causes and
conditions within a larger natural process. They are not separate from
nature.</p>
<p>Wise and virtuous people establish codes of conduct in order to foster
social peace and wellbeing. They wish for society to be just and
upright, to be based in righteousness (the Dhamma). For this purpose,
they link these codes of conduct with those systems inherent in nature,
generating positive results for everyone in that society. {309} Such
people are clever in managing causes and conditions; they understand two
overlapping systems of causes and conditions.</p>
<p>When people are endowed with wholesome intention, they already engage in
one form of positive kamma. But how should they act in order to generate
good results according to such intentions? How can they affect the
causes and conditions within natural dynamics so that they may achieve
their desired end? The answer is simple: they must comprehend the
requisite causes and conditions, and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Here, another vital spiritual faculty, inherent in people themselves,
comes to the fore, namely, wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). Wisdom is another condition
of nature that plays a participatory role in these natural processes.</p>
<p>Wisdom is crucial because it has insight into nature. When developed, it
becomes deeper and more comprehensive, until it is perfected. This way,
one realizes the truth.</p>
<p>Intention enables one to give rise to those causes and conditions
leading to success. With good intentions and a comprehensive
understanding of causes and conditions, wisdom then guides one’s
behaviour. In a social context, one then applies social conventions in
order to bring about a virtuous and just society.</p>
<p>In regard to codes of conduct (<em>vinaya</em>), intention draws upon causes
and conditions to establish systems of rules and regulations. These
codes are effective for producing positive results, even for those
individuals who are not particularly virtuous or wise themselves. At
this stage, the natural causal process is embodied and manifest within
this code of conduct, enabling wholesome causes and conditions to be
effective in a widespread and long-lasting way.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, from the perspective of Dhamma, if one behaves
immorally, one will reap the fruits of one’s actions according to the
law of kamma. Yet the <em>vinaya</em>, or the set of human laws, does not wait
for these effects to come to fruition. Human laws lay down authorized
forms of conduct (<em>kamma-sammati</em>), and the person who transgresses
these laws is called into an assembly and punished. The <em>vinaya</em> does
not wait for the Dhamma; it responds immediately, according to these
authorized forms of conduct.</p>
<p>For example, if bhikkhus quarrel with one another, there are means for
settling disputes, by taking legal proceedings in order to determine
fault, give a verdict, and impose a punishment. Here, a sangha assembly
acts according to established prescriptions, in order to settle the
matter.</p>
<p>If there is a legal case pending, but the monks fail to carry it out,
they are also considered blameworthy. The Buddha did not permit them to
simply claim that they were waiting for the law of kamma to sort things
out. The <em>vinaya</em> does not delay; it proceeds immediately with its own
authorized form of kamma. (See the Vinaya Piṭaka for many examples of
formal acts of the sangha, including acts of censure –
<em>niggaha-kamma</em>.)</p>
<p>In sum, there exist two major systems: the Dhamma and the <em>vinaya</em>. In
terms of social matters, the <em>vinaya</em> deals with certain matters
immediately. The <em>vinaya</em> establishes and implements conventions that
enable the Dhamma to become manifest in society. If one neglects this
second system, one’s Dhamma practice will be faulty and one’s society
will deviate from the truth.</p>
<p>Here, a deeper level of understanding is required. The expression ’the
vinaya does not wait for the Dhamma’ – for instance in the above
example of the monastic community applying authorized prescriptions and
not waiting for ’genuine’ kamma to bear fruit – is an informal way of
speaking.</p>
<p>One needs to guard against the misunderstanding that human beings are
separate from nature and somehow exempt from its laws. {310} The
establishment of conventions and the application of codes of behaviour
pertain to a unique ability belonging to human beings, who are capable
of taking personal sets of conditions and integrating them into wider
dynamics of nature, in order to generate wholesome and desirable
results.</p>
<p>In other words, the system of human conventions is a means for people to
integrate their distinctive qualities of intention and wisdom into the
wider natural causal process, influencing it so that it functions in
such a way as to produce favourable results for individuals and their
society.</p>
<p>Wisdom and wise deliberation are natural phenomena, but they belong to
the domain of immaterial phenomena (<em>nāma-dhamma</em>), and they are
exceptional qualities arising as a consequence of training and
development, which is part of people’s spiritual potential. Human
beings’ distinction and excellence, giving rise to cultures and
civilizations, lies precisely at this point. For if people are unable to
apply these spiritual properties to shape the world around them in
positive ways, what good is it to be a human being?</p>
<p>The fact that human activities stemming from wisdom and deliberation
have the capability to influence the stream of natural causes and
conditions, giving rise to favourable results, is an appeal and summons
for people to develop these spiritual qualities, in order to achieve
true success.</p>
<p>Human communities (including the monastic sangha) require concord and
unity (<em>sāmaggī</em>), so that their members accept the conventions and
comply by the mutually agreed-upon prescriptions. The codes of conduct
in such communities will thus succeed at bringing about desired results.</p>
<p>In sum, there are two kinds of kamma:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Kamma inherent in nature (<em>dhamma</em>), constituting the law of kamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kamma inherent in conventional codes of conduct (<em>vinaya</em>),
established by human beings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In regard to the monastic code of discipline (the Vinaya), if a monk
misbehaves, the sangha applies authorized forms of conduct
(<em>kamma-sammati</em>) prescribed by the Buddha to deal with the situation
without waiting for the law of kamma to be fully activated. By applying
these authorized prescriptions stemming from human wisdom and
deliberation, one integrates human spiritual factors with the law of
nature on a wider scale.</p>
<p>Note that the kamma inherent in conventional codes of conduct does not
only pertain to punishment or to problem solving, but may also be linked
to positive and favourable action. The formal sangha acts in the
monastic Vinaya, for example, include ordination ceremonies
(<em>upasampadā-kamma</em>), Uposatha Day ceremonies (<em>uposatha-kamma</em>), the
formal invitation for admonishment (<em>pavāraṇā-kamma</em>), and various
conventional activities (<em>sammati-kamma</em>) like electing sangha officers.</p>

<p>Trans.: note the definitions of these terms contained in Ven. Phra
Payutto’s ’Dictionary of Buddhist Terminology’ (พจนานุกรมพุทธศาสน์
ฉบับประมวลศัพท์): <em>sammāsambuddha</em>:</p>
<p>A perfectly enlightened being; a being who realizes the Four Noble
Truths, without having learned them from someone else, thus initiating
the propagation of the Truth (<em>sacca-dhamma</em>) and establishing
Buddhism; <em>pacceka-buddha</em>: a kind of Buddha whose realization is
private and unshared; he does not teach others. Note also the
well-known teaching from the Vinaya Piṭaka:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Here Sāriputta, the Lords Kakusandha, Konāgamana and Kassapa were
diligent in teaching the Dhamma in detail to their disciples, and
they had many discourses in prose, in prose and verse … and
catechetical discourses. They prescribed the training rules for
their disciples, and laid down the Pāṭimokkha. When these Buddhas,
these Blessed Ones, and their awakened disciples passed away,
disciples of later generations of various names, families and clans
went forth and preserved the teaching for a very long time. It is as
if various flowers, loose on a plank of wood, well tied together by
a thread, are not scattered and dispersed by a gust of wind. This is
because they are well tied together by the thread…. It is for this
reason that the teaching of the Lords Kakusandha, Konāgamana and
Kassapa lasted long.</em></p>

</div>
<p>To conclude, those teachers endowed with supreme wisdom, who have
realized the Dhamma, arrived at the highest truth, and are awakened, are
known as Buddhas, but if they stop at this point, they are Silent
Buddhas (<em>pacceka-buddha</em>). If, however, by virtue of their great
compassion they establish and apply a Vinaya so that all of humanity
benefits from the Dhamma, they are perfectly enlightened Buddhas
(<em>sammāsambuddha</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-sammasambuddha">Definition of Sammāsambuddha</a>)</p>
<p>Therefore, to derive the greatest value from Buddhism, besides realizing
the Dhamma (realizing the laws of nature), one needs to establish a
<em>vinaya</em> (attend to matters pertaining to human society). {311}</p>
<h3 id="does-the-law-of-kamma-conflict-with-the-teaching-on-nonself"><a class="header" href="#does-the-law-of-kamma-conflict-with-the-teaching-on-nonself">Does the Law of Kamma Conflict with the Teaching on Nonself?</a></h3>
<p>Some beginning students of Buddhism may wonder whether the law of kamma
conflicts with the teaching on nonself (<em>anattā</em>). If everything,
including our bodies and mind, is nonself, how is it possible for kamma
to function? Who is that performs volitional actions? Who receives their
fruit?</p>
<p>These sort of doubts existed even at the time of the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>[The following doubt arose in one of the monks]: ’So it seems,
material form … feeling … perception … volitional formations …
consciousness is not self. What self, then, will actions done by the
not-self affect?’</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, knowing in his mind the thought in the mind of
that monk, addressed the monks thus: ’It is possible, monks, that some
misguided man here, whose mind is subject to ignorance and overcome by
craving, might believe that he can outshine and outstrip the Teacher’s
dispensation thus: “So it seems, material form … feeling …
perception … volitional formations … consciousness is not self.
What self, then, will actions done by the not-self affect?”</p>
<p>’Now, monks, you have been taught by me in-depth through repeated
inquiry in regard to various subject matters and principles. What do
you think? Is material form permanent or impermanent?’ –
’Impermanent, venerable sir.’ ’Is feeling … perception …
volitional formations … consciousness permanent or impermanent?’ –
’Impermanent, venerable sir.’ – ’Is what is impermanent oppressive or
easeful?’ – ’Oppressive, venerable sir.’ – ’Is what is impermanent,
oppressive, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: “this is
mine, this I am, this is my self”?’ – ’No, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>’Therefore, any kind of material form whatever … is simply material
form. Any kind of feeling … perception … volitional formations….
Any kind of consciousness whatever … is simply consciousness. You
should see it as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ’This is not
mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Seeing thus, a well-taught
noble disciple becomes disenchanted with material form, feeling,
perception, volitional formations, and consciousness…. [His mind]
is liberated…. There is no more for this state of being.’</p>

</div>
<p>Before investigating this sutta passage more closely, let us consider
the following comparison:</p>
<p>Imagine that one is standing next to a river. For the majority of its
course the river passes through relatively flat land and its current is
slow. The banks along the river contain mostly red clay and the colour
of the river is thus reddish. Moreover, the river passes many densely
populated areas, and it has been polluted by human waste and industrial
toxins, decreasing the natural stock of aquatic life like fish and
shrimp. {312}</p>
<p>The slow current, reddish tint, polluted water, and paucity of wildlife
comprise the characteristic features of this river. Some of these
features will be shared by other rivers, but this precise collection of
features is characteristic to this river alone.</p>
<p>Later, someone mentions that this river is called Castle River. People
then go on to confirm what one sees oneself, that the Castle River is
polluted, absent of fish, slow-moving, and coloured by red clay.</p>
<p>One can make the observation that the body of water one is looking at is
inherently complete according to its own nature. It is endowed with
specific attributes, e.g. slow-moving, reddish, dirty, etc., because of
various interconnected conditioning factors and processes giving rise to
such attributes. When the current flows by the red clay banks, for
example, the water is reddened. Various events and occurrences produce
natural results.</p>
<p>Moreover, as one is watching this river, the current flows by nonstop.
The water one observes at one moment is not the same water as that which
passes one by at a later time. This change and movement notwithstanding,
the river retains its characteristic features, because the conditioning
factors combining to form this body of water remain the same. If someone
else comes by and declares that this river is called Castle River, and
that Castle River is slow-moving, polluted, etc., this has no bearing on
the true nature of the river. There exists no separate, distinct
identity of a ’Castle River’, which has some proprietary role over the
body of water one is presently observing.</p>
<p>Others may say: ’Castle River erodes the red clay banks and is
consequently tinted red.’ This may give the impression that the river is
functioning in some kind of active role as a separate identity and is
duly fined for its actions. Yet it is obvious that this body of water
exists as an inherently complete causal process. The water striking the
banks and the clay dissolving into the water is the cause; the reddening
of the water is the result. There exists no separate agent or recipient
in this dynamic.</p>
<p>No concrete, independent entity called Castle River is visible. The
current of water that has passed one by has flowed on; the water one
observed a moment ago is no longer present; it is continually being
replaced by a new current of water. We are able to describe or define
this river simply by the various factors, conditions, occurrences, etc.
that combine and produce visible characteristics. If an absolute or
fixed entity called Castle River were to truly exist, then the current
of water would not be subject to the various causes and conditions that
interact with it. Eventually, one recognizes that the identity of a
’Castle River’ is superfluous. One is able to describe and refer to this
body of water in a fully accurate way without needing to apply this
label. In truth, there is no such thing as a ’Castle River’. No fixed
entity, no ’self’, exists that is called Castle River, which owns,
interferes with, or controls this current of water.</p>
<p>Later, one travels to another district. Here, one wishes to describe to
its residents the body of water that one previously observed, but one is
faced with a stumbling block. One is not sure how to express oneself.
One remembers that earlier someone referred to this body of water as
Castle River. Now, by applying this name, one is able to conveniently
refer to this river when speaking to these other people. One can explain
to them that Castle River is slow-moving, polluted, ruddy, etc. {313}</p>
<p>Here, one gains a clear recognition that the name ’Castle River’ (and
the related terms for the river’s attributes) applied to describe this
natural body of water is simply a conventional designation used for the
sake of convenience in communicating with others. Whether these terms
exist or not, or whether one chooses to use them or not, however, they
have no bearing on this body of water. The river exists as a dynamic
stream of water flowing continuously according to its own causes and
conditions. One is able to distinguish between these conventional labels
and the natural phenomena. Endowed with a proper understanding, one is
able to use these terms with a sense of ease.</p>
<p>In truth, conventional labels such as ’person’, ’Mr. Adams’, ’Mrs.
Pearce’, ’we’, and ’you’, refer to dynamics in nature existing as
unbroken currents of interrelated causes and conditions. They manifest
in myriad forms according to their specific conditional factors,
including both factors inherent to the dynamic itself and related
external factors.</p>
<p>When a particular kind of interaction between factors arises as a cause,
it produces the effect of change and alteration within a specific
dynamic. In relation to human beings, that which is called <em>kamma</em> and
<em>vipāka</em> (i.e. action and the fruits of action) is equivalent to the
events and occurrences unfolding in line with the causal continuum
comprising a specific individual. Every natural phenomenon is inherently
complete in the sense that it is independent of conventional labels.
This is also true for human beings, who exist independently from such
labels as ’I’, ’you’, ’him’, ’Susan’, ’Paul’, etc., who may be referred
to as an owner, instigator, recipient, and so on.</p>
<p>This is how things really exist according to nature. For the sake of
convenience, while communicating with other people, however, one may
choose to use conventional labels by assigning names and designations to
these fluid dynamics, for instance as ’David’, ’Nancy’, ’Duke’,
’Duchess’, ’boss’, etc. When people are identified by such labels they
may validly be referred to as the owner, instigator, recipient, etc.,
according to the circumstances. Regardless of whether these names and
designations exist or are used, however, the dynamics of nature proceed
according to natural laws and are shaped by their respective causes and
conditions. The important point here is to be able to clearly
distinguish between natural phenomena themselves and their specific
conventional designations. One should not get these two aspects jumbled
up. Before using conventional designations, one ought to have a thorough
understanding of phenomena acting as a basis.</p>
<p>Natural phenomena themselves, and their conventional designations, are
both indispensable. Natural phenomena (often referred to as ’absolute
realities’ – <em>paramattha</em>) are aspects of nature. Conventional
designations have to do with the practical affairs of human beings.
Problems arise because people often confuse these two, that is, they try
to make the phenomena conform to the designations, causing all sorts of
trouble. The phenomena themselves do not suffer any affliction; they
simply proceed according to their own nature; they take no interest in
whether people attach to them or not. It is human beings alone who are
afflicted. And because the phenomena themselves are unsympathetic to
people’s afflictions, people feel that their desires are thwarted and
suffer even more.</p>
<p>In the earlier sutta passage, it is obvious that the doubt-stricken
bhikkhu confused principles he had learned about natural phenomena with
conventional concepts that he was personally attached to, giving rise to
confusion and perplexity. In the sentence: <em>What self, then, will
actions done by the not-self affect?</em> the clause ’actions done by the
not-self’ reflect this monk’s understanding of natural phenomena, while
’what self will be affected?’ reveal his attachment to conventional
terms and designations. As a matter of course, these two phrases are at
odds with one another.</p>
<p>The principles of nonself and kamma are not mutually contradictory. Just
the opposite: the former supports the latter, because the law of kamma
is only possible because of the truth of nonself. When a specific
dynamic in nature unfolds, all of its component factors interact as a
continual and interconnected process of arising and passing away. This
allows for an interrelated stream of causes and conditions. No solid and
constant entity lies in rigid isolation in the middle of this stream,
impeding the current and preventing it from flowing as it does.</p>
<p>If a fixed permanent self (<em>attā</em>) were to exist the law of kamma would
be impossible, because such a self would not be subject to causes and
conditions; nothing could gain access to it. Nothing would be able to
alter or transform such a self. Eventually, as one sees in some
eternalist doctrines, human beings need to be separated into two
overlapping layers: people only receive the effects of their actions on
an external layer; essentially, or at the core, however, the ’self’ or
’soul’ remains constant, unchanging, and unaffected by any events in the
world. {314}</p>
<p>Human beings are able to perform volitional actions and receive the
fruits of such actions without a need for an enduring ’actor’ or
’recipient’ taking part. When one encounters any process in nature, one
needs to inquire into what are the interrelated conditions giving rise
to the dynamic. Similarly, what are the results of this dynamic, i.e.
how does it transform and change? In reference to human beings, the
conditional factors collectively referred to as ’volitional action’
(<em>kamma</em>) are the cause, bearing fruit (<em>vipāka</em>) for the individual.
One can refer to this process as human actions and the fruits of
actions, without the need for a separate entity of an ’owner’ of these
actions and their results.</p>
<p>Kamma is equivalent to this process of cause and effect, which is
distinct from the conventional labels we affix to things. When people
agree with one another to apply conventional names on a natural dynamic
comprising a single human individual, say by calling one person Mac and
another person Lily, then an entity recognized as ’Mac’ or ’Lily’ is
acknowledged as being the agent or recipient of specific actions. The
natural phenomenon – the body-mind process – however, is inherently
complete and proceeds irrespective of such names and conventions; it
proceeds independently.</p>
<p>When one uses conventional language (e.g. one says, ’Mac performed
such-and-such and action, and he received such-and-such results’), then
one should make it clear that one is speaking on this level. Likewise,
when one speaks on an ultimate level, or refers to absolute truths (e.g.
one describes the causes and conditions that bring about particular
results in a body-mind dynamic), one should be clear about this too. If
one is aware of one’s goals and objectives while using speech, and one
does not mix up these various levels of truth, then there is no
problem.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn95-1"><a href="#fn-fn95">95</a></sup></p>
<p>One’s examinations need not focus on human beings, who are made up of an
extremely intricate and complex convergence of causes and conditions, on
account of the addition of various mental factors. Even in the case of
material things, for instance in the case of Castle River mentioned
earlier, people are often attached to conventional labels and create
fixed identities around natural phenomena.</p>
<p>Mental factors are extremely subtle and refined. It happens that some
people are not even able to discern change within the mind. There are
those who make the claim: ’Who says perception is impermanent and
uncertain? Perception is permanent, because wherever it arises it
invariably exists as perception. This is constant.’ There are others who
may be inclined to share this opinion, but this matter may be clarified
by asking them to compare mental factors to material things. The above
claim is similar to saying: ’Who says the body is impermanent? The body
is constant and stable – wherever the body arises it exists invariably
as the body.’ The misunderstanding here is the same: it arises due to a
confusion between the phenomenon itself (e.g. perception or the body)
and its conventional designation (e.g. ’perception’, ’the body’).
Whereas the person here is ostensibly claiming that perception is
permanent, what he in effect is saying is that the name ’perception’ is
stable and constant.</p>
<p>A study of the principles of kamma by only focusing on conventional
identities leads to an overly broad understanding of cause and effect.
One may examine particular bad deeds performed by someone on a specific
day in the past and link these to negative results occurring ten years
later. Here, one outlines a causal relationship spanning the single
stretch of ten years. Such an examination fails to provide a clear and
detailed glimpse of the causal process, because it does not explain the
continual stream of relevant causes and conditions. A detailed study of
phenomena, however, helps to discern the uninterrupted, interconnected
stream of events, and reveals the true connection between actions and
their fruit.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn96-1"><a href="#fn-fn96">96</a></sup> {315}</p>
<p>Chris may get into an argument with one of his neighbours and becomes so
incensed that he murders him. Fearing capture by the authorities and the
vengeance of the man’s relatives and companions, he goes into hiding.
Eventually, he is captured and punished.</p>
<p>Even after his prison sentence is complete, Chris still feels afflicted
by this evil deed and is haunted by the image of his neighbour. He
experiences both physical and emotional agony; he is unable to find any
peace. His outward appearance also changes; he appears melancholy,
suspicious, and miserable.</p>
<p>On account of other factors, for example the fact that he is physically
strong, he becomes irascible and violent. After a long period of time
his personality changes; he becomes crude and cruel, and he covers over
his suffering by acts of force. He becomes a danger to society and is
unable to find any joy among other people.</p>
<p>A short account of this story would simply state: ’Chris performed a
vile act and reaped the fruits of his deeds.’ Using such everyday,
conventional language is easy for people to understand; it provides
convenience for communication. But it only describes an external state
of affairs or a coarse picture of refined interconnected causes and
conditions. It does not reach the essential causal interrelationship of
natural phenomena.</p>
<p>A discussion of the absolute nature of phenomena, on the other hand,
describes the gist of natural processes. For instance, one may say:
’Within this particular dynamic of five aggregates, anger arises in the
mind, resulting in further volitional activity and an expression of
physical action. The mind continues to be shaped by anger, leading to an
alteration in the quality of the mind, which is now characterized by
such negative states as mistrust, fear, and malicious thoughts. When the
mind is frequently conditioned by anger, negative mind states are
accumulated until they become fixed personality traits. These negative
mind states create suffering within the individual, and in this case
even lead to physical pain and suffering.’</p>
<p>Such a discussion of phenomena is complete, without needing to refer to
a man named Chris or to some conventional identity. The dynamic here comprises various factors which arise and act as interrelated causes
and conditions. There is action and the fruition of action, without the
need for an ’actor’ or ’recipient’.</p>
<p>Regardless of which kind of language one uses, the essential truth of
the phenomena in question remains the same. The difference is that a
discussion of the absolute nature of things mentions only pure aspects
of reality, without adding conventional concepts on top of reality.</p>
<p>The following story may help to clarify this matter:</p>
<p>A man named Pong visited one of the senior monks in the monastery.</p>
<p>He asked: ’Luang Por,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn97-1"><a href="#fn-fn97">97</a></sup> the Buddha taught that everything is nonself
(<em>anattā</em>); everything is selfless and insubstantial; everything exists
without a true owner. There is no actor and there is no recipient of
action. In that case, I can go and hit someone or kill someone, because
there exists no one who acts and no one who receives the fruit of
action.’</p>
<p>Hardly had these words left Pong’s mouth when the elder monk seized a
cane from beside his seat and swung it at Pong. Pong barely had time to
protect himself and the cane struck him squarely in the arm. He sat
rubbing the bruise.</p>
<p>’Luang Por, why did you do that to me?!’ Pong rasped, barely suppressing
his anger.</p>
<p>’What was that like?’ the monk asked nonchalantly.</p>
<p>’You hit me. I’m in pain!’ Pong replied, his face strained. {316}</p>
<p>’Action exists without an actor; the fruits of action exist without a
recipient; feelings exist without an experiencer of feelings; pain
exists without one who feels pain’, the monk said dispassionately, as if
he were giving a sermon. ’One who looks for selfish gain in the teaching
on nonself does not escape from self. One who grasps onto the teaching
of nonself is indeed one who grasps onto self, devoid of any
understanding into nonself. One who attaches to the idea that there is
no actor has not relinquished the idea that a victim of pain exists. He
has no insight that in truth there is neither actor nor one who
experiences pain.’</p>
<p>The moral of this story is that if one is bent on the claim that no doer
exists behind volitional actions, then one must also abandon such
statements as ’I am in pain’.</p>
<h2 id="practical-value"><a class="header" href="#practical-value">Practical Value</a></h2>
<p>The practical value of the teaching on kamma may be summarized as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It establishes people firmly in reasoned discernment and sound
judgement; it enables people to see actions and the fruits of action
in the light of interrelated causes and conditions; it prevents
people from gullible beliefs and from giving undue importance to
sensationalized rumours and ideas, for example the belief that a
particular river is sacred or divine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It reveals how desired results and aspired goals are achievable by
way of action and engagement, therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One must develop self-reliance and make determined effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One should not seek or expect results by prayer and
supplication, for instance by propitiating divine forces.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It encourages people to take responsibility for themselves by
abstaining from immoral behaviour and to take responsibility for
others by performing benevolent deeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It confirms that all people equally possess the natural right to
develop and improve themselves. Through their actions, people are
able to either decrease or increase in virtuous qualities, and at
the highest degree they are able to reach such distinction that they
are greater than celestial beings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It asserts that the true yardsticks for determining human
inferiority and excellence are each individual’s spiritual
qualities, capabilities, and conduct. In this regard, distinctions
made according to birth, caste, or social class are irrelevant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It urges people to use past kamma as a lesson for life and to
increase their own self-understanding; it gives relatively little
importance to blaming or focusing on others’ misdeeds and offences.
In this way one recognizes one’s own basic qualities and condition,
so that one is able to improve oneself and to correctly plan one’s
own spiritual development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It provides hope to people for the future.</p>
</li>

<p>These aspects of practical value are evident in the following teachings
by the Buddha.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is volition, monks, that I call kamma. For having willed, one acts
by body, speech, or mind.</p>
<p><em>A. III. 415.</em></p>
<p>Beings are owners of their actions, heirs of their actions; they
originate from their actions, are related to their actions, have their
actions as their refuge. It is action that distinguishes beings as
inferior and superior. {317}</p>
<p><em>M. III. 203.</em></p>
<p>Whatever sort of seed is sown,<br />
That is the sort of fruit one reaps:<br />
The doer of good reaps good;<br />
The doer of evil reaps evil.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 227.</em></p>
<p>That deed is not well done when, after having done it, one is in
misery, and when weeping, with tearful face, one reaps the fruit
thereof.</p>
<p>That deed is well done when, after having done it, one is free of
misery, and when, with joy and pleasure, one reaps the fruit thereof.</p>
<p><em>Dh. verses 67-8.</em></p>
<p>Foolish people devoid of wisdom behave like enemies towards
themselves. They go about doing evil deeds which yield only bitter
fruit. That deed is not well done when, having done it, one is in
misery, and when weeping, with tearful face, one reaps the fruit
thereof.</p>
<p>But that deed is well done when, after having done it, one is free of
misery, and when, with a joyful and satisfied heart, one reaps the
fruit thereof. One should promptly do the deed one knows leads to
one’s own welfare.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-twelve-kinds-of-kamma"><a class="header" href="#appendix-twelve-kinds-of-kamma">Appendix: Twelve Kinds of Kamma</a></h2>
<p>The presentations in the commentaries and sub-commentaries on the twelve
kinds of kamma (classified as three groups of four) can be summarized as
follows:</p>
<h3 id="group-no-1"><a class="header" href="#group-no-1">Group no. 1</a></h3>
<p>Classified according to the time of taking effect (<em>pākakāla</em>; ’time of
ripening’):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhadhammavedanīya-kamma:</em></p>
<p>’Immediately effective kamma’; kamma bearing fruit in the present,
i.e. in this state of existence; either good or bad kamma performed
at the time of the first ’impulsive mind moment’ (<em>javana-citta</em>;
’mind moment of running through an object’). (Altogether there are
seven such mind moments in one cognitive series – <em>javana-vīthi</em>;
the first <em>javana-citta</em> is also referred to as the first
’intentional impulse’ – <em>javana-cetanā</em>). This kind of kamma only
bears fruit in this lifetime. If it does not have the opportunity to
bear fruit in this lifetime, it becomes <em>ahosi-kamma</em>, i.e. it will
no longer bear fruit (see below). The reason it bears fruit in this
lifetime is that it constitutes the first moment of intention and is
not subject to other forms of kamma; it manifests as initial
volitional activity, exerting a unique influence. Despite its
influence, it bears no fruit beyond this lifetime, because it is not
habitually repeated, and thus its effects are minor or negligible.
This is compared to a hunter who sees a deer, grabs an arrow, and
immediately shoots. If he strikes the target the deer falls on the
spot, but if he misses the deer escapes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Uppajjavedanīya-kamma:</em></p>
<p>Kamma bearing fruit in the next life, i.e. the next state of
existence; either good or bad kamma performed at the time of the
final ’impulsive mind moment’ (<em>javana-citta</em>), i.e. at the seventh
mind moment in one cognitive series; this final <em>javana-citta</em> is
also referred to as the seventh ’intentional impulse’. This kind of
kamma only bears fruit in the next lifetime. If it does not have the
opportunity to bear fruit in the next lifetime, it becomes
<em>ahosi-kamma</em>. The reason it bears fruit in the next lifetime is
that it comprises the final moment of intention. It fulfils one’s
inclinations and it inherits the habitual repetition from previous
moments of intention. At the same time, however, its power is
limited, because it is the mind moment at which the cognitive series
(<em>javana-vīthi</em>) comes to an end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Aparāpariyavedanīya-kamma:</em></p>
<p>’Indefinitely effective kamma’; kamma bearing fruit in subsequent
states of existence; either good or bad kamma performed during the
five intermediate ’impulsive mind moments’ (<em>javana-citta</em>), i.e.
between the second and the sixth impulsive mind moment (or
’intentional impulse’) in one cognitive series. This kind of kamma
bears fruit continually in the future, beyond the next lifetime,
i.e. it bears fruit whenever there is an opportunity. As long as one
remains in the round of rebirth (<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>), it does not
become <em>ahosi-kamma</em>. It is compared to a hound chasing a deer;
whenever it catches up with the deer, it clamps its teeth on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ahosi-kamma:</em></p>
<p>Kamma ceasing to bear fruit; either good or bad kamma that has had
no opportunity to bear fruit during the time when it had the
potential to bear fruit. When this time has passed by, it no longer
bears fruit. (The term <em>ahosi-kamm</em>a was originally used in Pali to
denote ’previously performed kamma’, rather than ’kamma ceasing to
bear fruit’ or ’kamma having already borne fruit’. The commentators,
however, use it with the specific meaning of ’existing kamma devoid
of fruit (<em>vipāka</em>)’.)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn103-1"><a href="#fn-fn103">103</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="group-no-2"><a class="header" href="#group-no-2">Group no. 2</a></h3>
<p>Classified according to function (<em>kicca</em>) in respect to fruition:</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <em>Janaka-kamma:</em></p>
<p>’Productive kamma’, ’kamma leading to birth’; either good or bad
kamma (i.e. ’intention’) causing the birth of the ’aggregates’
(<em>khandha</em>), which constitute the ’fruit of action’ (<em>vipāka</em>), both
at the moment of conception (<em>paṭisandhi</em>) and during the entire
course of one’s life (<em>pavatti-kāla</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <em>Upatthambhaka-kamma:</em></p>
<p>’Supportive kamma’; kamma associated with productive kamma
(<em>janaka-kamma</em>) that is unable to bear fruit on its own, but
supports or consolidates productive kamma, causing the happiness and
unhappiness arising within the aggregates to exist for a long time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <em>Upapīḷaka–kamma:</em></p>
<p>’Obstructive kamma’; kamma opposed to productive kamma
(<em>janaka-kamma</em>) which acts to obstruct the fruit of both productive
kamma and supportive kamma (<em>upatthambhaka-kamma</em>), causing the
happiness and un-happiness arising within the aggregates to exist
for a short time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>8.</strong> <em>Upaghātaka-kamma:</em></p>
<p>’Destructive kamma’; potent obstructive kamma that severs the power
of less potent forms of kamma, supplanting or overriding them. An
example is the parricide by Ajātasattu, which nullified his
wholesome deeds. {322}</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="group-no-3"><a class="header" href="#group-no-3">Group no. 3</a></h3>
<p>Classified according to order of strength in bearing fruit
(<em>pākadāna-pariyāya</em>):</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>9.</strong> <em>Garuka-kamma:</em></p>
<p>’Weighty kamma’; kamma with exceptionally powerful effects. On the
positive side this refers to the eight concentrative attainments
(<em>samāpatti</em>); on the negative side it refers to the five heinous
deeds (<em>anantariya-kamma</em>), e.g. matricide. It tends to bear fruit
first and override other forms of kamma, similar to a large
reservoir overflowing its banks and flooding smaller bodies of
water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10.</strong> <em>Bahula-kamma (or āciṇṇa-kamma):</em></p>
<p>’Habitual kamma’; either good or bad kamma performed frequently and
made habitual, e.g. constant moral or immoral behaviour. Whichever
kamma has been performed repeatedly and possesses more power bears
fruit first. This is similar to two wrestlers; whichever one is
stronger and more proficient wins. In the case that no weighty kamma
exists, habitual kamma bears fruit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>11.</strong> <em>Āsanna-kamma:</em></p>
<p>’Proximate kamma’, ’death-threshold kamma’; the kamma that one
performs or remembers immediately before one dies and that has
recently made an impression on one’s mind. If the two aforementioned
kinds of kamma do not exist, then this proximate kamma bears fruit.
(Note, however, that the Abhidhammatthavibhāvinī states that
proximate kamma bears fruit before habitual kamma –
<em>āciṇṇa-kamma</em>). This is similar to a pen crowded with cows; when
the cowherd opens the gate, the cow closest to the gate exits, even
if it is old and frail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>12.</strong> <em>Katattā-kamma (or katattāvāpana-kamma):</em></p>
<p>’Casual act’, ’reserve kamma’; kamma performed with weak intention,
or kamma performed indirectly, with some other intention in mind.
This is a mild form of kamma. It is similar to an arrow shot by a
madman; whenever the three aforementioned kinds of kamma do not
exist, this reserve kamma bears fruit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha contains another set of four kinds of kamma,
for a total of sixteen kinds:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn104-1"><a href="#fn-fn104">104</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="group-no-4"><a class="header" href="#group-no-4">Group no. 4</a></h3>
<p>Classified according to location (i.e. sphere of existence – <em>bhava</em>)
of effect (<em>pākaṭṭhāna</em>):</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>13.</strong> <em>Akusala-kamma:</em></p>
<p>Unwholesome kamma, with the exception of restlessness (<em>uddhacca</em>).
In another sense, this refers to the ten unwholesome courses of
action (<em>akusala-kammapatha</em>). Such unwholesome action is likely to
lead to birth in states of misery (<em>apāya-bhūmi</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>14.</strong> <em>Kāmāvacarakusala-kamma:</em></p>
<p>Wholesome kamma on the level of the sense sphere (<em>kāmāvacara</em>), for
example the ten bases of meritorious action (<em>puññakiriyā-vatthu</em>).
Such action is likely to lead to birth in the seven sensuous happy
planes (<em>kāmasugati-bhūmi</em>): the human realm and the six celestial
realms (<em>sagga</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>15.</strong> <em>Rūpāvacarakusala-kamma:</em></p>
<p>Wholesome kamma on the level of the fine-material plane
(<em>rūpāvacara</em>); this refers to the four fine-material jhānas of
those individuals who have not yet realized the fruit of
arahantship.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn105-1"><a href="#fn-fn105">105</a></sup> Such action is likely to lead to birth in the
fine-material sphere (<em>rūpa-bhava</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>16.</strong> <em>Arūpāvacarakusala-kamma:</em></p>
<p>Wholesome kamma on the level of the formless plane (<em>arūpāvacara</em>);
this refers to the four formless jhānas of those individuals who
have not yet realized the fruit of arahantship. Such action is
likely to lead to birth in the formless sphere (<em>arūpa-bhava</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 id="further-notes"><a class="header" href="#further-notes">Further Notes</a></h3>
<p>The Abhidhammatthasaṅgaha arranges these four groups of kamma in the
following order:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Group 1 = group 2<br />
Group 2 = group 3<br />
Group 3 = group 1<br />
Group 4 = group 4</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Visuddhimagga arranges the groups as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn106-1"><a href="#fn-fn106">106</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Group 1 = group 1<br />
Group 2 = group 3<br />
Group 3 = group 2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Manorathapūraṇī explains the twelve kinds of kamma in more detail
than in any other texts.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn107-1"><a href="#fn-fn107">107</a></sup> It defines this classification of kamma
as an exposition by sutta specialists (<em>suttantika-pariyāya</em>). It only
counts eleven distinct kinds of kamma, as it considers <em>ahosi-kamma</em> as
simply the condition in which various forms of kamma do not bear fruit.
It claims that this term is inserted in various passages simply to
describe various (other) forms of kamma, and is thus not a distinct form
of kamma in itself.</p>
<p>It goes on to explain that an exposition in accord with the Abhidhamma
(<em>abhidhamma-pariyāya</em>) refers to sixteen kinds of kamma based on the
four accomplishments (<em>sampatti</em>) and the four defects
(<em>vipatti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn108-1"><a href="#fn-fn108">108</a></sup> {323}</p>
<p>There are several other commentarial texts which present an incomplete
description of these various kinds of kamma, most notably the
Papañcasūdanī, which only explains the first and second groups.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn109-1"><a href="#fn-fn109">109</a></sup></p>
<p>It is fair to say that these twelve kinds of kamma represent a
commentarial interpretation, although some of these factors have a clear
basis in the Pali Canon. This is true in particular with the first three
factors of the first group, classified according to the time of taking
effect:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, what is the result of kamma? The result of kamma, I say, is
threefold: [to be experienced] in the present (<em>diṭṭhave dhamme</em>),
or in the [next] rebirth (<em>uppajje vā</em>), or on some subsequent
occasion (<em>apare vā pariyāye</em>).</p>
<p><em>A. III. 415.</em></p>
<p>Monks, there are these three causes for the origination of kamma. What
three? Greed … hatred … delusion …</p>
<p>Any kamma fashioned through greed, born of greed, caused by greed,
originated by greed … fashioned through hatred … fashioned through
delusion … originated by delusion ripens wherever the individual is
reborn. Wherever that kamma ripens, it is there that one experiences
its result, either in the present, or in the [next] rebirth, or on
some subsequent occasion.</p>

<p>The commentary to these sutta passages is precisely the Manorathapūraṇī,
which presents the most detailed description of the twelve kinds of
kamma, as cited above.</p>
<p>In the Mahākammavibhaṅga Sutta, the Buddha divides people into four
kinds, related to the fruition of kamma, as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn110-1"><a href="#fn-fn110">110</a></sup></p>
<p>The first kind of person performs the ten unwholesome courses of action.
On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a state of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. This
is because earlier he did an evil action to be experienced as painful,
or later he did an evil action to be experienced as painful, or at the
time of death he maintained acute wrong view. Since he has performed the
ten unwholesome courses of action, he will experience the result of that
either here and now (<em>diṭṭhave dhamme</em>), or in his next rebirth
(<em>uppajje vā</em>), or in some subsequent existence (<em>apare vā pariyāye</em>).</p>
<p>The second kind of person similarly performs the ten unwholesome courses
of action. Yet, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he
reappears in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world. This is
because earlier he did a good action to be experienced as pleasant, or
later he did a good action to be experienced as pleasant, or at the time
of death he maintained right view to the full. But since he has
performed the ten unwholesome courses of action, he will experience the
result of that either here and now, or in his next rebirth, or in some
subsequent existence.</p>
<p>The third kind of person performs the ten wholesome courses of action.
On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world. This is because earlier he did
a good action to be experienced as pleasant, or later he did a good
action to be experienced as pleasant, or at the time of death he
maintained right view to the full. Since he has performed the ten
wholesome courses of action, he will experience the result of that
either here and now, or in his next rebirth, or in some subsequent
existence.</p>
<p>The fourth kind of person similarly performs the ten wholesome courses
of action. Yet, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he
reappears in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in
perdition, even in hell. This is because earlier he did an evil action
to be experienced as painful, or later he did an evil action to be
experienced as painful, or at the time of death he maintained acute
wrong view. But since he has performed the ten wholesome courses of
action, he will experience the result of that either here and now, or in
his next rebirth, or in some subsequent existence.</p>
<p>The commentaries explain this passage by using the terms
<em>diṭṭhadhamma-vedanīya</em>, <em>uppajja-vedanīya</em>, and
<em>aparāpariya-vedanīya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn111-1"><a href="#fn-fn111">111</a></sup> Furthermore, one is able here to see the
suggestion or source of the concept of <em>āsanna-kamma</em> (actions performed
or reflected upon immediately before death). {323}</p>
<p>The Apadāna, which recounts the past lives of various disciples,
mentions proximate kamma (<em>āsanna-kamma</em>) in numerous passages.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn112-1"><a href="#fn-fn112">112</a></sup>
One example is the story of an elder who was a hunter in a past life.
One day he encountered the Buddha Tissa. Out of faith he offered a
handful of grass for the Buddha Tissa to sit on, and consequently his
mind was pure and bright. Soon after that he was mauled and killed by a
lion. Because of his deeds shortly before death, of meeting the Buddha
Tissa, making an offering, and gaining faith, he was born in heaven.
These passages reveal that the consideration of actions close to death
and the use of the term <em>āsanna-kamma</em> in this context was prevalent at
the time that this early text was composed.</p>
<p>The term <em>diṭṭhadhamma-vedanīya-(kamma)</em> is mentioned in several other
passages of the Pali Canon,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn113-1"><a href="#fn-fn113">113</a></sup> but it is paired with the term
<em>samparāya-vedanīya</em> (’bearing fruit in the future’) in a group of ten
factors. The remaining eight factors are: <em>sukha-vedanīya</em> (’bearing
fruit as pleasure’); <em>dukkha-vedanīya</em> (’bearing fruit as pain’);
<em>paripakka-vedanīya</em> (’bearing fruit for an individuality brought to
maturity’, ’bearing fruit for an individuality whose time has come’);
<em>aparipakka-vedanīya</em> (’bearing fruit for an individuality whose time
has not yet come’); <em>bahu-vedanīya</em> (’bearing abundant fruit’);
<em>appa-vedanīya</em> (’bearing meagre fruit’); <em>vedanīya</em> (’necessarily
bearing fruit’); and <em>avedanīya</em> (’not necessarily bearing fruit’).</p>
<p>The terms <em>diṭṭhadhammavedanīya-kamma</em>, <em>uppajjavedanīya-kamma</em>, and
<em>aparāpariyavedanīya-kamma</em> appear clearly in their complete form in the
Kathāvatthu, which Ven. Moggalliputta-Tissa Thera composed at the time
of the Third Recitation, in about 218 B.E. (325 BC).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn114-1"><a href="#fn-fn114">114</a></sup> The term
<em>ahosi-kamma</em> also appears clearly from early on, in the
Paṭisambhidāmagga.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn115-1"><a href="#fn-fn115">115</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentaries present an additional group of twelve kinds of kamma:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Previously performed action (<em>ahosi-kamma</em>), with previously
existing fruits of action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously performed action, without any previously existing fruits
of action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously performed action, with the fruits of action presently in
existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously performed action, with no existing fruits of action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously performed action, with fruits of action existing in the
future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously performed action, with no fruits of action existing in
the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing action with existing fruits of action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing action with no existing fruits of action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing action with fruits of action existing in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing action with no fruits of action existing in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action existing in the future with fruits of action existing in the
future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action existing in the future with no fruits of action existing in
the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The commentaries explain this group in conformity with the previous
group of twelve kinds of kamma.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn116-1"><a href="#fn-fn116">116</a></sup> The gist of this teaching is that
there are six kinds of kamma that bear fruit and six kinds of kamma that
do not bear fruit. Note how the term <em>ahosi-kamma</em> here refers to
’previously performed action’.</p>
<p>The other terms, e.g. <em>garuka</em> and <em>āciṇṇa</em>, were used in the Pali Canon
in other contexts. Only in the commentaries were they used to describe
distinct kinds of kamma.</p>

<p>Trans.: I hesitate to use the terms ’karma’ or ’karmic’ in this
text, as there are many misunderstandings of the Buddhist concept of
karma/kamma. As a case in point, note the first two definitions of
karma in ’Collins Concise Dictionary, Fourth Edition 1999’: 1.
Hinduism, Buddhism. the principle of retributive justice determining
a person’s state of life and state of his reincarnations as the
effect of his past deeds; 2. destiny or fate. Hopefully, this text
will demonstrate and explain just how remote these definitions are
from the original Buddhist connotations. <a href="#fr-fn1-1">↩</a></p>

<aside class="footnote-definition" id="fn-fn2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>The Buddha described the close link between Dependent Origination
and the law of kamma: ’The wise, those who discern Dependent
Origination and are skilled in action and its results, recognize
volitional action according to the truth, thus…’ (M. II. 196; Sn.
123). <a href="#fr-fn2-1">↩</a></p>

<p>Abhidhamma scholars would state that, although human beings, who
are made up of the five aggregates, are subject to all of the
natural laws, only some parts of the five aggregates arise as a
consequence of and are directly governed by kamma. The Abhidhamma
makes the distinction, for example, that the material form
(<em>rūpa-dhamma</em>) of our bodies may arise as a consequence of kamma,
of mind (<em>citta</em>), of physical laws (<em>utu</em>), or of food (<em>āhāra</em>). <a href="#fr-fn5-1">↩</a></p>

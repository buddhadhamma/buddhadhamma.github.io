<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>If one poses the question whether Buddhism affirms the existence of
supernatural phenomena (see
Note <a href="#note-supernatural">The Term ’Supernatural’</a>) and celestial beings, the answer based
on literal evidence in the Tipiṭaka and other scriptures is
unequivocally yes. Scriptural confirmation for this reply is extensive
and abundant.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1-1"><a href="#fn-fn1">1</a></sup> Having said this, it is difficult for people to reach
an agreement or consensus on whether these things truly exist or not.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">The Term ’Supernatural’</span><a id="note-supernatural"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trans.: note that I use the term ’supernatural’ here in the sense of
’exceeding the ordinary’, ’miraculous’, ’belonging to a higher realm’,
or ’an event that appears inexplicable by the laws of nature’. As the
venerable author points out in chapter 4 of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> on
Dependent Origination, the Buddhist teachings do not recognize a
supernatural entity, as existing above nature and having power over
it. In a similar vein, the term ’supernatural’ here does not imply a
reality outside the natural world or a power going beyond natural
forces. In this sense, the term ’supermundane’, although not a common
word, may be more accurate in this context.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Many people feel that a belief in these things has harmful consequences,
a viewpoint that has led some scholars to interpret these phenomena in a
metaphorical way. It is not necessary here to examine these
interpretations at length. Even if one accepts the literal
interpretation that these things exist, the Buddhist teachings contain
adequate safeguards to help prevent superstitious beliefs or an
obsessive need to prove the validity of the supernatural.</p>
<p>Many people, from the ancient past to the present day, have believed in
or feared ghosts, spirits, divine powers, the mystical, and the
miraculous. Buddhism boldly asserts the existence of these things while
declaring a freedom for humans in relation to them. The Buddhist
teachings set forth principles that help people benefit from their
relationship to supernatural phenomena. At the very least, upholding
these principles causes less harm than trying to discover incontestable
proof for the existence or non-existence of such things. It is important
to know what these Buddhist principles are and how to apply them to
daily life.</p>
<p>Buddhism is not interested in the debate whether supernatural phenomena
and divine beings truly exist or not, and it discourages people from
wasting time trying to prove the existence of these things. Buddhism is
interested rather in people’s attitude and proper conduct in relation to
the supernatural. In Buddhism, it is less important to know whether
gods, spirits, ghosts, psychic powers, or miracles exist than to know
(assuming that these things do exist) what sort of bearing they have on
human life and to know the proper relationship to them. {942}</p>
<p>Some people may counter that one cannot know how to properly relate to
these things until one has first proven their existence. But it is
precisely the obsessive desire to prove the existence (or non-existence)
of these things that has led to so much unskilful behaviour in relation
to them. And to this day no definitive proof has been found either way.</p>
<p>Supernatural phenomena, including psychic powers and divine beings, are
unprovable: it is impossible to offer indisputable evidence for their
existence or non-existence. Believers in these things are unable to
convince non-believers of their existence, while disbelievers are
likewise unable to present clear-cut evidence to believers of their
non-existence, whereby these latter people relinquish any lingering
belief in their validity. Both parties abide on the level of faith or
belief: they believe these things exist, or believe they do not exist,
or they outright reject their existence. (Even if one has truly
witnessed these things, one is unable to accurately share this
realization with others.)</p>
<p>Apart from there being no undisputed proof that these things exist or do
not exist, these things are elusive or evasive: occasionally an exciting
trace of these things leads to a feeling of certainty in their
existence, but as soon as one tries to capture the phenomenon, the
feeling proves unsatisfactory. Even at times when a person feels
convinced of these things’ existence, doubts arise; the more one
searches for them, the more elusive they become; the more elusive they
are, the more fascinating they become. An obsession with supernatural
phenomena may thus lead people to almost drift away from this world.</p>
<p>Efforts to prove the existence of such unverifiable and mysterious
phenomena are a waste of time and energy and create all kinds of
problems, both individual and social. As long as effort is being
expended on the futile search for definitive proof, believers and
disbelievers argue with one another, refute each other’s theories, cause
discord, and end up going their own ways. They are unable to modify
their attitudes and behaviour because they are waiting for conclusive
evidence, which never comes. No true consensus or unity is ever reached.</p>
<p>On a social or political level, a lack of consensus or agreement on
these issues may lead to coercion or even persecution. Believers may
then force non-believers into adopting a particular faith. Conversely,
non-believers may prohibit believers from practising their beliefs, as
is seen in some political ideologies that hold entirely to the
scientific method. If government officials in such political systems
think that people hold foolish or superstitious beliefs, they may force
the people to abandon their beliefs and to adopt the state ideology (of
repudiation of supernatural phenomena).</p>
<p>But this coercion does not solve the problem at its source; it does not
’clear’ people from doubt;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn2-1"><a href="#fn-fn2">2</a></sup> force merely leads to a suppression of
faith. {943} Such control can be maintained as long as the force or
persuasion is strong, but as soon as these weaken, the suppressed faith
sprouts, blossoms and spreads. And when this happens, the beliefs and
practices may be as irrational, directionless, and harmful as before,
without having been attended to and corrected.</p>
<p>From one perspective, the supernatural exists primarily as a set of
beliefs in the minds of unawakened persons, and these beliefs are liable
to fluctuation. Some people originally repudiate the supernatural and
look upon believers with contempt, but after they have what they believe
to be a mystical experience their perspective shifts completely and they
become zealous believers. Without access to teachings clarifying a
proper relationship to these things, they become more spellbound and
preoccupied with them than those who believe from the beginning.
Likewise, some people who have had a firm faith in these things later
have an experience suggesting the object of their faith is
unsatisfactory or uncertain, and as a consequence their faith is shaken
or they become outright disbelievers.</p>
<p>This being the case, many people are caught up with the question whether
these things exist or not, while at the same time they lack practical
measures that help to prevent the harm in holding fixed beliefs and
opinions. Buddhism emphasizes practical considerations: it teaches those
things that every person can apply and benefit from, suitable to their
individual level of maturity and ability. In reference to supernatural
phenomena, Buddhism offers clear teachings: the emphasis is on one’s
relationship to them and on knowing one’s reasons for adopting certain
attitudes and behaviour in relation to them. In other words, it is not
crucial to believe or disbelieve in these things; rather, a person
should develop a proper relationship to them.</p>
<p>Both believers and non-believers can follow the Buddhist principles on
this subject; if they do, their conduct in relation to questions of the
supernatural will differ in only a negligible way. Furthermore, this
conduct will benefit both parties (of believers and disbelievers),
because each side will develop mutual care and consideration. Believers
will uphold their faith in a way that does not cause harm to themselves
or others, while non-believers will respect believers and may be able to
advise them on how to relate to the objects of their faith
constructively.</p>
<p>This principle of balanced practice – of establishing an appropriate
attitude and relationship to things that cannot be proven and need not
be directly realized for spiritual fulfilment – is a unique
characteristic of Buddhism, distinguishing it from other religions and
philosophies, including modern ideologies.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn3-1"><a href="#fn-fn3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>When based on these proper principles, there is no harm in searching for
proof of supernatural phenomena. If people have this special interest
and do not cause trouble to others, then we can maintain an open mind to
such a pursuit. It can be seen as similar to research in other fields of
knowledge. {944}</p>
<p>Because matters concerning the supernatural are unprovable, people’s
attitude and relationship to these things is crucial. And because these
things exist primarily as a set of beliefs in people’s minds, the
particular belief in either the existence or non-existence of these
things is of minor importance.</p>
<p>In sum, the existence or non-existence of supernatural phenomena,
including divine beings and psychics powers, have little bearing on the
key teachings and tenets of Buddhism. Even though miracles and divine
beings are claimed by the scriptures to exist, the practice and highest
realization of Buddhism is possible without a person having any
engagement with these things.</p>
<p>In relation to this subject the Buddha said:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Buddha:</em> What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Whether I perform
miracles, which are qualities of supreme persons, or not, does the
Dhamma that I have taught to reach the goal lead to the total
destruction of suffering?</p>
<p><em>Sunakkhatta:</em> Lord, whether the Lord performs miracles, which are
qualities of supreme persons, or not, the Dhamma that the Blessed One
has taught to reach the goal leads to the total destruction of
suffering.</p>
<p><em>The Buddha:</em> What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Whether I make known
that which is considered the origin of the world or not, does the
Dhamma that I have taught to reach the goal lead to the total
destruction of suffering?</p>
<p><em>Sunakkhatta:</em> Lord, whether the Lord makes known that which is
considered the origin of the world or not, the Dhamma that the Blessed
One has taught to reach the goal leads to the total destruction of
suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn4-1"><a href="#fn-fn4">4</a></sup> {945}</p>
<p><em>D. III. 3-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h2 id="miracles-and-psychic-powers"><a class="header" href="#miracles-and-psychic-powers">Miracles and Psychic Powers</a></h2>
<h3 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>Although psychic powers are classified as expressions of ’higher
knowledge’ (abhiññā),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn5-1"><a href="#fn-fn5">5</a></sup> psychic powers of all kinds, including the
’divine ear’, clairvoyance, telepathy, and recollection of past lives,
are mundane forms of higher knowledge. They are connected to mundane
phenomena, belong to the domain of unawakened beings, and remain under
the sway of mental defilement.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn6-1"><a href="#fn-fn6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>People achieved these mundane forms of higher knowledge even before the
time of the Buddha; they are not dependent on the arising of Buddhism.
Psychic powers do not comprise the essence of Buddhism and they are not
necessary for reaching its goal.</p>
<p>The essence of Buddhism, and that which accompanies the arising of
Buddhism, is knowledge leading to the cessation of suffering and mental
impurity. This knowledge, classified as the sixth (and final) form of
higher knowledge, is called ’knowledge leading to the end of the taints’
(<em>āsavakkhaya-ñāṇa</em>). It is a transcendent form of knowledge
(<em>lokuttara-abhiññā</em>), exclusive to awakened beings. It leads unawakened
people to deliverance and purity, to freedom from worldly constraints,
and to complete realization as a ’noble being’ (<em>ariya-puggala</em>).</p>
<p>The mundane forms of higher knowledge can decline, whereas transcendent
supreme knowledge is unshakeable. Achieving transcendent supreme
knowledge is superior to achieving all five of the mundane forms of
higher knowledge, but achieving the mundane forms in addition to
transcendent supreme knowledge is considered outstanding and a sign of
perfection. Transcendent supreme knowledge is essential for a truly
virtuous life; mundane forms of higher knowledge are not essential, but
rather enhance a person’s personal qualities.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn7-1"><a href="#fn-fn7">7</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="three-kinds-of-miracles"><a class="header" href="#three-kinds-of-miracles">Three Kinds of Miracles</a></h3>
<p>The Buddha classified psychic powers as one of the three kinds of
miracles (pāṭihāriya):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn8-1"><a href="#fn-fn8">8</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Iddhi-pāṭihāriya</em>: the miracle of performing psychic powers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ādesanā-pāṭihāriya</em>: the miracle of mind-reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anusāsanī-pāṭihāriya</em>: the miracle of instruction: the teaching of
truth, which leads to true insight and fulfilment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is how these miracles are described in the Pali Canon:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The miracle of performing psychic powers: There are some who perform
various kinds of supernormal power: having been one, he becomes
many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he
goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a
mountain as if through space; he dives in and out of the earth as if
it were water; he walks on water without sinking as if it were
earth; he flies through the air like a bird; with his hand he
touches and strokes the sun and the moon, so powerful and mighty; he
exercises mastery with his body even as far as the Brahma world.
{946}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The miracle of mind-reading: Here, a monk reads the minds of other
beings, of other people, reads their mental states, their thoughts
and considerations, and declares: ’This is how your mind is, this is
how it inclines, this is in your heart.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn9-1"><a href="#fn-fn9">9</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>There are some who by means of a sign, declare: ’This is how your mind
is, this is how it inclines, this is in your heart.’ And however many
such declarations he makes, they are exactly so and not otherwise.
Another does not make his declarations by means of a sign, but after
hearing voices of humans, of spirits or devas declares: ’This is how
your mind is, this is how it inclines, this is in your heart’ … or
by hearing the sound of a person’s applied and sustained thoughts as
he thinks, declares: ’This is how your mind is, this is how it
inclines, this is in your heart’ … or by mentally penetrating the
mind of someone in a thought-free state of concentration, knows
clearly the mental volitional formation in that person’s mind, and
knows that after this volitional formation he will have this train of
thought. And however many such declarations he makes, they are exactly
so and not otherwise.</p>
<p><em>D. III. 103-104; Ps. II. 227-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The marvel of mind-reading (<em>ādesanā-pāṭihāriya</em>) appears similar to
telepathy (<em>cetopariya-ñāṇa</em> or <em>paracitta-vijānana</em>), but it differs in
that the former is still at the level of intuitive perception; it has
not yet reached the level of ’direct knowledge’ (<em>ñāṇa</em>).</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li><strong>3.</strong> The miracle of instruction: Here, a monks gives instruction as
follows: ’Reflect in this way, do not reflect in that way; pay
attention in this way, do not pay attention in that way; you should
abandon this, and dwell in the attainment of that.’</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In the Kevaddha Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya this passage is followed by a
description of the Buddha appearing in the world and teaching the
Dhamma, which instils faith in people, leading them to go forth as
renunciants, develop good conduct, sense restraint, mindfulness and
clear comprehension, seek solitude, develop the jhānas, and attain the
six forms of higher knowledge, ending with knowledge of the destruction
of the taints and the realization of arahantship. All of these results
of teaching are examples of the ’miracle of instruction’.</p>
<p>Here are the literal meanings of the Pali words mentioned above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Pāṭihāriya</em> (’miracle’): to ’beat back’, ’drive away’, or ’destroy’
something that is unfavourable or hostile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Iddhi</em> (’psychic power’): ’achievement’, ’accomplishment’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ādesanā</em> (’mind-reading’): to ’indicate’, ’reveal’, ’point out’,
’make clear’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anusāsanī</em>: ’repeated instruction’.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying these definitions, the Paṭisambhidāmagga explains the three
kinds of miracles in a new way. It states that all virtuous qualities,
like renunciation, lovingkindness, jhāna, insight into selflessness, and
the path of arahantship are <em>iddhi-pāṭihāriya</em> in the sense that they
lead to specific achievements and eliminate negative qualities like
sensual desire, ill-will, and other mental defilements. All virtuous
qualities are <em>ādesanā-pāṭihāriya</em> in the sense that they only arise in
the presence of a clear heart and unclouded mind. And virtuous qualities
are <em>anusāsanī-pāṭihāriya</em> because the teachings have emphasized their
proper application, cultivation, development, and balance.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn10-1"><a href="#fn-fn10">10</a></sup> Although
these are not common explanations for these miracles, they offer a
thought-provoking perspective.</p>
<h3 id="psychic-powers-are-not-essential"><a class="header" href="#psychic-powers-are-not-essential">Psychic Powers Are Not Essential</a></h3>
<p>The householder Kevaddha once went to the Buddha and asked him to
perform a miracle:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Lord, this city of Nāḷandā is rich, prosperous, populous, and full of
people who have faith in the Blessed One. It would be well if the Lord
were to request some monk to perform a superhuman miracle. In this way
the citizens of Nāḷandā would come to have even more faith – would
come to have boundless faith – in the Blessed One.</p>
<p>The Buddha replied: Kevaddha, this is not the way I teach the Dhamma
to the monks, by saying: ’Go, monks, and perform superhuman feats for
the white-clothed laypeople.’ {947}</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha goes on to say that of the three kinds of miracles, he
disfavours psychic powers and mind-reading, because he sees their
potential harm: when hearing about these things, those who believe in
their validity become further convinced, while those who are skeptical
deny their validity. They may claim that a monk who performs these feats
has resorted to using a magical charm (<em>gandhārī</em>), a mind-reading charm
(<em>maṇīkā</em>), or some other trick. This disparity of opinion is followed
by arguments and disagreements.</p>
<p>The Buddha then explains the meaning and value of the miracle of
instruction, saying that it can be applied and its benefits realized by
everyone, until one reaches knowledge of the destruction of the taints,
which is the goal of Buddhism.</p>
<p>He gave an example of a monk who was highly skilled in psychic powers
and who wanted to know where the four great elements cease without
remainder.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn11-1"><a href="#fn-fn11">11</a></sup> This monk travelled to the celestial realms in search of
an answer to this question, pressing on until he arrived at the Brahma
realms. But finally, unable to get an answer, he returned to the human
realm in order to ask the Buddha to explain the true nature of the
world. This story shows how psychic powers are limited, often
ineffective, and not the essence of the Buddhist teachings.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn12-1"><a href="#fn-fn12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>On another occasion the brahmin Saṅgārava mentioned to the Buddha a
conversation occurring among the king’s courtiers in the palace on the
following subject:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Formerly there were fewer monks, but there were more who displayed
miracles of supernormal power transcending the human level. But now
there are more monks, but fewer who display miracles of supernormal
power transcending the human level.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha replied by explaining the three kinds of miracles. He then
asked Saṅgārava which one of these three appeals to him as the most
excellent and sublime. Saṅgārava answered that a knowledge and
realization of the miracles of psychic powers and mind-reading is
restricted to those who perform them; this knowledge cannot be
transferred to others. From the outside, they appear as having the
nature of a magician’s trick. Therefore, the miracle of instruction is
superior and more sublime. The recipients of this instruction can
reflect on, apply, and realize these teachings, leading to the end of
suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn13-1"><a href="#fn-fn13">13</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="noble-psychic-powers"><a class="header" href="#noble-psychic-powers">Noble Psychic Powers</a></h3>
<p>Another passage in the Pali Canon describes two kinds of psychic
powers:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn14-1"><a href="#fn-fn14">14</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Psychic powers that are not ’noble’: psychic powers accompanied by
mental defilement and acting as a ’basis for suffering’ (<em>upadhi</em>),
i.e. psychic powers as normally understood and as discussed earlier.
Here, through determined effort, a renunciant attains liberation of
the mind (<em>cetovimutti</em>) and performs various supernormal feats,
like projecting mind-made images, walking through walls, flying
through the air, diving into the earth, or walking on water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’Noble’ psychic powers: psychic powers free from mental defilement
and not acting as a basis for suffering. In this case a monk
exercises self-mastery over his perceptions and is able to control
his responses to sense impressions. He can view a repulsive object
as not repulsive; for instance, he can look at a person whose face
is disfigured and relate to this person with kindness and
friendship. And he can view an attractive object as unattractive;
for instance, he can see a charming, enticing body as repugnant. Or
he can remain equanimous, relinquishing both the attractive and the
repugnant, for example while reflecting on things in an unbiased way
and seeing into their true nature. {948}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This passage confirms that psychic powers as normally understood – the
ability to perform amazing and fantastic feats – are neither praised in
Buddhism nor are they the essence of Buddhism. In Buddhism, the highest
form of psychic power is the ability to control one’s responses to sense
impressions and to develop mental self-mastery. This form of power
causes no harm to oneself or others.</p>
<p>Those who exercise the former kind of psychic powers may not be able to
exercise the latter, and they occasionally apply their psychic abilities
to indulge their defilements. The latter kind of psychic powers,
however, fosters wholesome qualities, eradicates defilement, and keeps
the mind from being seduced by greed, hatred and delusion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn15-1"><a href="#fn-fn15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>The fact that the Buddha established a training rule forbidding monks
from revealing psychic powers to laypeople also confirms that he did not
encourage their use.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn16-1"><a href="#fn-fn16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>As stated above, psychic powers are a form of mundane attainment, which
enhance the attributes of those who have attained transcendent
knowledge, helping them to better perform their activities and assist
other human beings. The Buddha referred to someone who is endowed with
the three kinds of miraculous gifts as a ’fully accomplished one’, ’one
who has reached the goal’, ’one who is supreme among gods and
humans’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn17-1"><a href="#fn-fn17">17</a></sup> {949}</p>
<p>As stated earlier, however, the miracle of instruction is the principal
and constant factor, while the remaining two miracles are supplementary.
When there is a good reason to perform the miracles of psychic powers
and mind-reading, they should be applied merely in the early stages,
preparing the way for the miracle of instruction. Instruction is the
goal and consummation, as will be discussed at more length below.</p>
<h3 id="dangers-of-psychic-powers"><a class="header" href="#dangers-of-psychic-powers">Dangers of Psychic Powers</a></h3>
<p>Psychic powers can be harmful both for people who possess them and for
those associating with these people. Unenlightened people who possess
these powers may be intoxicated by them:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn18-1"><a href="#fn-fn18">18</a></sup> they may become conceited,
feeling superior and denigrating others; they may become obsessed with
the material gains and honours accruing from such powers; they may
become dishonest; or they may use these powers for evil purposes, as in
the case of Ven. Devadatta.</p>
<p>At least, the attachment to or delight in psychic powers prevents a
person from realizing higher spiritual qualities and from cleansing the
mind from impurities. And because the psychic abilities of unawakened
persons are subject to decline, the anxiety around protecting these
powers is an obstacle, which interferes with wise reflection and the
effective application of insight. Psychic powers are thus classified as
obstacles to insight meditation (<em>iddhi-palibodha</em>), which should be
removed or eliminated by one who is developing wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn19-1"><a href="#fn-fn19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>There is a high likelihood that people associating with a person who has
psychic powers may also be harmed. The primary danger is that these
people will become victims. Someone possessing (or pretending to
possess) psychic powers may boast of these powers in order to seek
personal gain.</p>
<p>Note that those people who practise correctly and who have aptitude in
this area only exercise psychic powers in those circumstances when they
deem them appropriate as a channel leading to proper instruction. For if
not to offer Dhamma teachings, why would someone display such powers
other than to seek personal fame or material gain?</p>
<p>It is thus important to remember that psychic powers should always be
accompanied by proper instruction. If someone reveals or claims to have
psychic powers without these powers being a bridge leading to the
’miracle of instruction’, their behaviour can be considered
incorrect.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn20-1"><a href="#fn-fn20">20</a></sup> {950}</p>
<p>They may have bad or deceitful intentions, they may be seeking personal
gain, or they may simply have a deluded understanding of psychic powers.
This same principle can be applied in the case of sacred objects or
amulets: someone who uses such objects when relating to people, without
providing any form of teaching – without leading them to the
development of wisdom, to an understanding of the truth, and to a
gradual freedom from these objects – is practising incorrectly and
leading people in a wrong direction. (See
Note <a href="#note-wrong-direction">Leading in the Wrong Direction</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Leading in the Wrong Direction</span><a id="note-wrong-direction"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This subject includes sacred and magical objects, occult powers, and
those things the Buddha referred to as the base or ’beastly’ arts
(<em>tiracchāna-vijjā</em>). The base arts are forms of knowledge that bar
the way to heaven and to Nibbāna, or external teachings that do not
accord with the goal of Buddhism. They mostly involve divination,
prophesying, and the treatment of disease, which for a bhikkhu are
considered faulty and harmful from a moral point of view if he
practises these arts to make a living or to seek personal gain.</p>
<p><em>Tiracchāna-vijjā</em> are distinct from <em>iddhi-pāṭihāriya</em>.
<em>Tiracchāna-vijjā</em> are discussed at D. I. 9-12 and mentioned
repeatedly in the Sīlakkhandhavagga of the Dīgha Nikāya. There are
precepts forbidding the learning and teaching of these arts at, e.g.:
Vin. II. 140; Vin. IV. 306; explained at, e.g.: DA. I. 131; Nd1A. II.
402.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Even if a person does not fall victim to someone who claims to possess
psychic powers, a fascination or preoccupation with these things runs
counter to two important Buddhist principles:</p>
<p>First, Buddhism teaches the path to liberation. Because psychic powers
are not of essential importance to Buddhism – they are not directly
related to the goal of Buddhism and do not help people to be free from
mental defilement – a fascination with these things tends to be a waste
of time and energy, which could be used to practise the Dhamma.</p>
<p>Second, those people who associate with someone claiming psychic or
sacred powers generally wish for help from supernatural or divine
forces, say for good luck or wealth. This behaviour is inconsistent with
a central tenet of Buddhism, which is a teaching of action
(<em>kamma-vāda</em>), a teaching of activity (<em>kiriya-vāda</em>), and a teaching
of effort (<em>viriya-vāda</em>): Buddhism teaches people to seek results
through determined, deliberate action in line with cause and effect.</p>
<p>The wish for results through supplication to divine or supernatural
forces can lead to inactivity or laziness. It leads to a lack of effort,
a lack of urgency to undertake necessary tasks or to avoid harm, and it
contradicts the principle of heedfulness.</p>
<p>If one takes an interest in psychic powers it is better that one
develops these powers oneself (although this still may be a waste of
time), because the wish for results from others’ powers or from divine
forces is a reliance on external things and makes a person more
dependent on them. Instead of leading to more independence, this
reliance on external things makes a person less grounded and more
confused; a person’s resourcefulness, inner strength, and
self-confidence is diminished. The reliance on external things
contradicts another basic principle of Buddhism, which teaches
self-reliance – being a refuge unto oneself. Buddhism teaches the path
to liberation, which at the end transcends faith and leads to pure
wisdom. The Path begins with dependence on the wisdom of the
Teacher,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn21-1"><a href="#fn-fn21">21</a></sup> who is a ’spiritual friend’ (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>). Eventually,
one can abandon even this form of dependence and stand on one’s own two
feet, without the support from a teacher.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn22-1"><a href="#fn-fn22">22</a></sup> {951}</p>
<h3 id="proper-relationship-to-psychic-powers"><a class="header" href="#proper-relationship-to-psychic-powers">Proper Relationship to Psychic Powers</a></h3>
<p>Regarding how the display of psychic powers affects people in general,
let us look at the conduct of the Buddha and his disciples, who were
exceptionally skilled in psychic powers. As mentioned earlier, the
Buddha clearly disfavoured the miracles of performing psychic powers and
mind-reading, but consistently supported and applied the miracle of
instruction; instruction lies at the heart of the Buddha’s activities.
There were instances, however, when the Buddha performed psychic powers.</p>
<p>By looking at these occasions, we can conclude that the Buddha only
exercised psychic powers when he was subduing (or ’taming’) those who
possessed these powers – those who gave great import to these powers or
who with arrogance felt superior to others – so that they would abandon
their infatuation with them. He performed psychic powers to subdue
psychic powers, to encourage a person who was fascinated in or conceited
about them to realize their limitation, and to see things that are
superior to them – to study and recognize things which the Buddha
revealed through the miracle of instruction. This is similar to the
aforementioned principle of applying psychic powers in conjunction with
instruction, but here the application is limited to those who are
intoxicated by psychic powers and who express a stubborn pride when
encountering the Buddha, for example in the story of subduing the god
Brahma.</p>
<p>There are some stories of the Buddha’s chief disciples combining the
display of psychic powers with instruction, to people who were
fascinated with these powers, for example the story of Ven. Sāriputta
instructing Ven. Devadatta’s disciples with the miracle of mind-reading,
and similar stories of Ven. Mahā Moggallāna exercising psychic powers.</p>
<p>There are a few stories of monks revealing psychic powers to help
people, but there is not a single instance in the Pali Canon of monks
exercising these powers as a consequence of people’s request for
them.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn23-1"><a href="#fn-fn23">23</a></sup> There were instances when people made this request because
they wanted to witness these powers, but the Buddha established a
training rule forbidding monks from displaying such powers to laypeople,
as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>In everyday life, people must live with other human beings and live
under ordinary circumstances. Rather than relying on invisible, external
forces, which have no direct connection to people, Buddhism emphasizes
how it is better to train and discipline oneself, to develop knowledge
and skill so that one can solve problems using ordinary, rational
methods and reach success through righteous means. The Buddha defined
the ability leading to success as a ’power’ (<em>iddhi</em>), which accords
with the Buddhist teachings. This ability is twofold: material power
(<em>āmisa-iddhi</em>) and spiritual power (<em>dhamma-iddhi</em>), the latter being
the leading principle.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn24-1"><a href="#fn-fn24">24</a></sup> {952}</p>
<p>There are two primary points revealing the limitations of psychic
powers, along with all forms of sacred or supernormal forces, revealing
that these powers are not of essential importance to Buddhism, are not
related to the goal of Buddha-Dhamma, are unnecessary for walking the
Buddhist path, and offer no true security or safety:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the perspective of wisdom, supernatural powers cannot directly
give rise to wisdom, to the penetration of truth, and to an
understanding of phenomena as they really are. An example of this
limitation is the story of the monk who possessed psychic powers and
went in search of an answer throughout all realms of existence until
he arrived at the realm of Brahma, who claims to have created the
world, yet this monk’s quest was in vain. A similar story describes
the rishi who unsuccessfully travelled in search of the end of the
universe until he died.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn25-1"><a href="#fn-fn25">25</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the perspective of the mind, psychic powers are unable to truly
eliminate mental defilements or to end suffering. When the mind is
confused, depressed, agitated, or overwhelmed by greed, hatred and
delusion, these powers are unable to lead to freedom; even if one
suppresses these negative states of mind through the power of jhāna,
this solution is only temporary. Whenever one exits the state of
concentration and faces ordinary life, the defilements return to
disturb and harass, and to cause suffering. Even worse, psychic
powers may be used to serve the defilements, as happened in the case
of Ven. Devadatta.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn26-1"><a href="#fn-fn26">26</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="divine-beings"><a class="header" href="#divine-beings">Divine Beings</a></h2>
<h3 id="human-beings-and-divine-beings"><a class="header" href="#human-beings-and-divine-beings">Human Beings and Divine Beings</a></h3>
<p>Most of the material in the preceding section on miracles and psychic
powers also applies to the subject of divine beings (devatā). (See
Note <a href="#note-devata">Divine Beings (Devatā)</a>) People generally take an interest in divine
beings for practical reasons: they wish and pray for help from divine
beings, who possess special powers, in the same way as they seek help
from other forms of supernatural powers. The aforementioned principles,
especially on the advantages and potential harm of supernatural powers,
are therefore relevant to the subject of divine beings. There are,
however, some additional matters for consideration.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Divine Beings (Devatā)</span><a id="note-devata"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The words <em>deva</em> or <em>devatā</em> encompass all divine beings, including
Brahma gods. Divine beings are categorized into three groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>devas of the sensual sphere; those beings attached to sensuality;
the abodes of these beings are sometimes referred to as the ’six
heavens connected to sensuality’ (<em>chakāmāvacara-sagga</em>): the
realm of the Four Great Kings (<em>cātummahārājikā</em>), the realm of
the Thirty-Three gods (<em>tāvatiṁsā</em>); the realm of the Yāma gods
(<em>yāmā</em>); the realm of the contented gods (<em>tusitā</em>); the realm of
the gods who rejoice in their own creations (<em>nimmānaratī</em>); the
realm of gods who lord over the creation of others
(<em>paranimmitavasavattī</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>divine beings of the fine material plane (<em>rūpa</em> Brahmas), of
which there are sixteen levels; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>divine beings of the formless plane (<em>arūpa</em> Brahmas).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Comp.: Vīthimuttaparicchedo, Paṭisandhicatukkaṁ.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Generally speaking, all forms of divine beings up to the highest levels
of Brahma gods are companions in birth, old age, suffering and death,
companions in the round of rebirth (<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>). Moreover, as is
the case with human beings, the majority of these divine beings are
unawakened beings (<em>puthujjana</em>), possessing mental defilements.
Although some divine beings are enlightened, most of them realized
enlightenment in a previous life as a human being. Although divine
beings are ranked as superior to human beings in spiritual qualities,
the celestial realms and the human realm are so similar that they are
both classified as a ’happy destination’ (<em>sugati</em>). {953}</p>
<p>In some respects divine beings have an advantage over human beings,
while in other respects human beings have the advantage. On one occasion
the Buddha compared the residents of India (<em>Jambudīpa</em> – ’Land of the
Rose-apple Trees’) with the gods of Tāvatiṁsā heaven, and claimed that
the gods are superior to humans in three aspects: divine age, divine
beauty, and divine happiness, while humans are superior to the gods in
three aspects: courage, mindfulness, and the practice of the holy life
(i.e. the practice of the noble path – <em>ariya-magga</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn27-1"><a href="#fn-fn27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Normally, humans consider themselves inferior to divine beings and want
to be reborn in heaven, but divine beings consider rebirth as a human
being to be a ’happy destination’, as confirmed by the Buddha: <em>The
human state, monks, is the devas’ reckoning of a good destination</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn28-1"><a href="#fn-fn28">28</a></sup>
When a divine being is about to pass away, the other devas invoke a
blessing so that this being may take birth as a human, since the human
realm is a place where one can choose to perform wholesome, virtuous
deeds and give oneself fully to Dhamma practice (of course, one can also
give oneself fully to unwholesome actions).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn29-1"><a href="#fn-fn29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The Buddha considered birth as one of the gods, who live an
exceptionally long time, as a wasted opportunity for practising the holy
life.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn30-1"><a href="#fn-fn30">30</a></sup> One can even call such a birth bad luck. Divine beings
experience undiluted happiness, which tends to lead to heedlessness and
to weakly established mindfulness. The human realm contains a mixture of
happiness and suffering, and it offers a wide range of experiences and
lessons. If a human being knows how to properly direct attention he or
she will gain understanding, develop mindfulness that is agile and
alert, develop self-discipline, and progress in the ’noble qualities’
(<em>ariya-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn31-1"><a href="#fn-fn31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>The human realm lies between the heavenly realms and the ’unhappy
destinations’ (<em>apāya</em>), for instance the hell realms. The unhappy
destinations are inhabited by beings who are evil or of base spiritual
qualities. Although some of these beings can be considered good, they
have fallen into these realms because unskilful deeds have borne fruit
and dragged them down. The celestial realms are inhabited by beings who
are comparatively virtuous. Although some of these beings are of bad
character, they were born in heaven because wholesome deeds lifted the
person up.</p>
<p>The human realm which lies in the middle is like a road junction – a
place for both divine beings and beings from states of perdition to pass
through. It is a place where beings from all realms of existence come to
produce <em>kamma</em>. It is where evil beings better themselves and prepare
for heaven, where virtuous beings commit evil deeds and prepare for
hell, and where wise beings stop producing kamma, disentangle
themselves, propagate the Dhamma, and find freedom from the cycle of
birth and death.</p>
<p>There are four levels of unhappy destinations. Beings in each
distinctive level possess a similar degree of unwholesome qualities
(<em>pāpa-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn32-1"><a href="#fn-fn32">32</a></sup> The celestial realms contain many different levels
with ascending degrees of refinement; beings in each level possess a
similar degree of virtue. Only the human realm is a centre for both vice
and virtue of all hues: it contains evil people who resemble the beings
from the deepest recesses of hell; it contains virtuous, refined people,
similar to the highest Brahma gods; and it contains beings who have
transcended all states of existence and whom even the gods venerate.
{954}</p>
<p>The spiritual qualities and general capabilities of humans and divine
beings are very similar, but human beings possess a greater opportunity
for spiritual development and self-improvement. Generally speaking,
devas are superior and more proficient than humans, but when humans
elevate themselves by spiritual cultivation, they are equivalent to or
even surpass the gods in virtue and ability (although from the
perspective of Dhamma, it is not encouraged to view this as a
competition).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn33-1"><a href="#fn-fn33">33</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="obsolete-form-of-relating-to-the-divine"><a class="header" href="#obsolete-form-of-relating-to-the-divine">Obsolete Form of Relating to the Divine</a></h3>
<p>Religions existing in India before the time of the Buddha were
polytheistic, but their adherents also believed in a chief God, who
created the world and all phenomena. It was not considered possible for
human beings to be superior to this God. People related to the gods
through prayer and entreaty, seeking ways to please and favour them, for
example through hymns of praise, worship, propitiatory offerings, and
sacrifice. Alternatively, people used other forms of supplication, by
pressuring the gods into taking an interest, provoking them until they
were worried and forced into lending a helping hand or appeasing the
supplicants. This latter method employed various religious and ascetic
practices of self-mortification and self-punishment. In sum, there are
two traditional ways of relating to divine beings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Through prayer and supplication; through offerings, worship, and
sacrifice, similar to the pleadings of a child with its parents.
Sometimes this behaviour turns into an effort to flatter or bribe
the higher powers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through coercion, compelling the devas through various ascetic
practices or religious rituals to act according to one’s wishes.
This resembles a child who, punching and biting, tries to force his
parents to pay attention and satisfy his desires.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both ways boil down to a search for personal gain and involve dependence
on an external force. When the Buddha began teaching, he encouraged
abandoning these two ways of practice, and it is this abandonment of
them that distinguishes Buddhism on this subject of divine beings. By
abandoning these practices, Buddhism is able to offer a more rational
approach, to point clearly to the advantages and harm of different ways
of acting, and to establish a new, more appropriate relationship to the
divine. {955}</p>
<h3 id="harmful-effects-of-depending-on-divine-beings"><a class="header" href="#harmful-effects-of-depending-on-divine-beings">Harmful Effects of Depending on Divine Beings</a></h3>
<p>Reliance on divine beings has similar limitations and creates similar
obstacles to those described above in relation to psychic powers. From
the perspective of wisdom, devas, like human beings, are on the whole
still ignorant of the truth. This is evident from the story of the monk
(mentioned earlier) who travelled through the various heaven realms
asking a question, which even the highest Brahma could not answer, and
the story of the Buddha subduing the Brahma named Baka.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the mind, devas are similar to human beings in
that most of them are unawakened – they still have a degree of mental
defilement and suffering; they are still spinning in the round of
rebirth (<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>). Examples for this are the god Brahma, who
despite his elevated spiritual qualities still heedlessly considers
himself immortal,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn34-1"><a href="#fn-fn34">34</a></sup> and Indra (King of the Tāvatiṁsā heaven), who is
intoxicated with divine treasures.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn35-1"><a href="#fn-fn35">35</a></sup> People seek help from Indra, but
Indra himself is not without greed, hatred, delusion, and fear.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn36-1"><a href="#fn-fn36">36</a></sup>
Apart from the dependence on divine beings conflicting with the
principles of achievement through perseverance and effort, of
self-reliance, and of liberation, as mentioned earlier in the section on
psychic powers, there are many other harmful consequences to such
behaviour:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is not only human beings who are harmed when they give
propitiatory offerings to and curry favour with devas. Because most
devas are unenlightened, they too suffer harm when they become
enamoured with praise and attached to offerings, and increasingly
want more of these things. In this way, both humans and devas become
preoccupied with worship and the effects of worship, abandoning or
neglecting their personal responsibilities, and falling into
carelessness and decline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some devas, when they become infatuated with offerings and praise,
look for ways to increase a sense of obligation and dependence in
people. For this end, they may lure people by satisfying some of
their wishes so that the people have increased expectations and make
more offerings, or they may even deliberately cause a crisis so that
people will feel the need to turn to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When acquisitive devas become obsessed with personal gain, virtuous
devas who help people without seeking personal advantage become
weary and stay away (customarily, devas do not wish to trouble
themselves or intervene in the affairs of human beings).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn37-1"><a href="#fn-fn37">37</a></sup> Good
people are then deprived of help and encouragement. As devas keen on
personal gain only help when they receive an entreaty or a
sacrificial gift, more people are then convinced that good deeds do
not lead to good results, but that it is evil deeds that lead to
good results. This causes social confusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When virtuous devas stay away this gives even greater opportunity
for acquisitive devas to seek personal advantage. For example, when
people make entreaties to a specific deity whom they worship,
covetous devas will come and deceive people by pretending to be that
specific deity. People will not know better because this matter is
beyond their reach of comprehension. The deceitful, impersonating
devas will then cause the people to be more fascinated and beguiled
by the supernatural. {956}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="proper-relationship-to-the-divine"><a class="header" href="#proper-relationship-to-the-divine">Proper Relationship to the Divine</a></h3>
<p>From these remarks we see that those people who receive assistance from
divine beings do not need to be good, and that good people do not
necessarily receive assistance from such beings. This is because, for
the most part, both humans and devas are unawakened and may practise
incorrectly; they then cause well-ordered systems in the world to be
disturbed and weakened.</p>
<p>Following are a few more observations on the subject of a proper
relationship to divine beings. First, devas are unable to unilaterally
and decisively control human circumstances or to determine the destiny
of human beings. Although it is generally understood that devas have
superior powers to humans, when humans develop themselves they are able
to equal or surpass the devas, as mentioned earlier. The deciding factor
for who is superior lies with an individual’s spiritual qualities and
effort, which is confirmed by this story in the Jātaka Tales:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Two kings from neighbouring kingdoms were preparing for battle. One
of the kings consulted with a rishi, who had psychic powers. This
rishi was able to converse with Indra, who informed him that the
king’s army would be victorious. The king therefore heedlessly let his
soldiers rest and entertain themselves. The other king, having heard
the prediction of his own defeat, redoubled efforts to strengthen his
army. In the ensuing battle, the army of this second king gained
victory. Indra, who was blamed, then uttered this divine maxim: ’<em>The
perseverance and effort of human beings, the devas are unable to
thwart</em>.’</em></p>
<p><em>J. III. 7; JA. III. 3-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>People often give honour and respect to the divine spirits that dwell in
their houses, but from one perspective these spirits are simply guests.
If the owner of the house is very virtuous, for example he or she is a
’noble disciple’ – secure in spiritual qualities and has progressed
from a reliance on faith to steadfast wisdom – the house devas do not
have control over the owner but rather must obey and respect him or her.</p>
<p>This is illustrated in the story of the deva who lived in the archway of
Anāthapiṇḍika’s house (Anāthapiṇḍika did not construct a special
dwelling for this deva). When Anāthapiṇḍika lost his wealth, the deva
came to him and suggested that he stop giving alms. Anāthapiṇḍika
considered this advice unrighteous and drove the deva away. The deva was
unable to find a new residence and thus went to Indra for help. Indra
instructed the deva on how to properly ask forgiveness from
Anāthapiṇḍika; on following this instruction the deva was given
permission to return to his original dwelling.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn38-1"><a href="#fn-fn38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>The accusations made by devas towards a person should not be taken as
ultimate criteria for the person’s faults or wrongs, because there are
many examples of devas disparaging good people. The deva mentioned in
the story of Anāthapiṇḍika above was referred to as having wrong view or
as ’blind and foolish’. This deva was unhappy that, when the Buddha or
his disciples visited the house, he would have to descend to the ground,
and so when Anāthapiṇḍika became poor, the deva urged him to stop
associating with the Buddha, but his plan came to nothing.</p>
<p>Some devas out of mischief instil a sense of mutual suspicion in
people.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn39-1"><a href="#fn-fn39">39</a></sup> Some forest devas are unhappy when monks go and live in the
forest to practise the Dhamma, because these virtuous people with
superior spiritual qualities have entered their domain, which makes them
feel frustrated and inconvenienced; they therefore look for ways to make
life uncomfortable for them.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn40-1"><a href="#fn-fn40">40</a></sup> Under these circumstances, the Buddha
recommended that the monks solve this problem by responding with
goodness and spreading lovingkindness. {957}</p>
<p>In the case that devas made proposals and suggested a person act in a
particular way, if these requests were deemed inappropriate or
unrighteous, the Buddha’s disciples who had a true understanding of his
teachings remained resolute and under no circumstances allowed
themselves to be persuaded by these suggestions, regardless of whether
the devas threatened them or promised rewards.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn41-1"><a href="#fn-fn41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>Third, some devas behave badly; they are hostile and repeatedly impede
the spiritual development of human beings. One should not only refrain
from soliciting or relying on these devas, but one should outright
subdue or conquer them with virtue. If people develop themselves well
they are able to overcome these devas.</p>
<p>An important example of this kind of deity is Māra.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn42-1"><a href="#fn-fn42">42</a></sup> Māra dwells in
Paranimmitavasavattī – the sixth and highest heaven of the sense
sphere. He likes to obstruct and harass others when they perform good
deeds, especially when someone tries to free himself from sensuality
(<em>kāma</em>); in such a case Māra fears that the person will transcend his
domain, and in this case the person must confront Māra to pass
beyond.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn43-1"><a href="#fn-fn43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>Māra has enormous power; even Indra flees and hides away at the
outskirts of the universe when Māra appears, and Brahma also avoids
him.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn44-1"><a href="#fn-fn44">44</a></sup> Occasionally, Māra goes to disturb the Brahma worlds, which
are fine-material spheres and higher than Māra’s normal realm of
existence.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn45-1"><a href="#fn-fn45">45</a></sup> The Buddha therefore said: <em>Of all powerful beings, Māra
is the greatest</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn46-1"><a href="#fn-fn46">46</a></sup> Although Māra has such great power, a person who
is well-trained in moral conduct, concentration and wisdom can conquer
him with his virtue, and such a person of supreme spiritual qualities is
revered by the devas all the way to the Brahma realms.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn47-1"><a href="#fn-fn47">47</a></sup></p>
<p>These words are not meant to encourage a feeling of contempt or
insensitivity in regard to divine beings, but rather to increase
understanding and help establish a proper relationship to them.</p>
<h3 id="buddhist-relationship-to-the-divine"><a class="header" href="#buddhist-relationship-to-the-divine">Buddhist Relationship to the Divine</a></h3>
<p>Based on an understanding of the nature of divine beings and the harm in
relating to them improperly, Buddhism teaches to abandon all dependence
on and supplication to them, whether in the form of prayer or through
coercion. Buddhism teaches a new form of relationship, one of
friendship, lovingkindness, and mutual respect. We should consider that
we are all companions in suffering and in the round of rebirth, and that
on the whole humans and devas exist at a high spiritual level. Humans
and devas should not disturb or interfere with each other, each making
effort to fulfil their individual responsibilities.</p>
<p>This relationship of non-disturbance and non-harm between humans and
devas is clearly depicted in the many stories from the scriptures,
especially in the Jātaka and Dhammapada commentaries. {958} In these
stories we see devas assisting human beings, but the nature of and
reasons behind this assistance differs from that found in earlier
traditions. Here, the devas help from their own initiative, prompted by
their own sense of goodness; they do not help because people ask and
they neither expect nor desire such entreaty. Those people who receive
help act virtuously and judiciously in an ordinary, independent fashion;
they do not expect to be helped and they do not seek such assistance.
The cause for this assistance is the goodness or good actions of human
beings; it is not a result of supplication or a form of reward.</p>
<p>In the scriptures, the chief deity who offers such assistance to human
beings is Sakka, also known as Indra,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn48-1"><a href="#fn-fn48">48</a></sup> king of the devas. The
principle of assistance by Sakka, which conforms to the Buddhist
principle of ’active engagement’ (<em>kamma</em>), evolved from the principle
of divine power espoused by pre-Buddhist religious doctrines.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn49-1"><a href="#fn-fn49">49</a></sup>
Although this principle is not yet purely in accord with the Buddhist
teachings, it has evolved in a distinctly Buddhist direction and has
been incorporated into the Buddhist tradition. The core of this
principle is that virtuous human beings act based on their own
mindfulness and wise judgement in as steady and determined a way as they
are able; they do not wait for, expect, or request assistance from
divine beings. Virtuous devas are eager to assist good people based on
their own sense of virtue. When good people are in trouble, virtuous
devas feel compelled to help. (See
Note <a href="#note-prayer">Prayer Without Effort</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Prayer Without Effort</span><a id="note-prayer"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In today’s world it appears that people rely heavily on supplication
and prayer. This would be acceptable if they first made effort, but it
is often the case that people make no effort before soliciting divine
beings. The devas in turn wait for a petition before descending and
they help those who offer the supplication, regardless of whether the
people are good or bad. Under such circumstances, one can assume that
the devas who come are acquisitive, disingenuous, or meek, getting
tied up with human affairs until both parties are corrupted.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Here, human beings behave well without expecting assistance from divine
beings, and devas offer assistance without expecting human entreaty.
Those people who are still concerned with the principle of divine power
can reflect on this saying: ’The responsibility of human beings is the
effort to do good; the responsibility of heaven is to assist good
people; fulfil your responsibility to the best of your ability.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn50-1"><a href="#fn-fn50">50</a></sup></p>
<p>If people do not make effort to develop goodness, but are caught up in
supplicating the devas, and if the devas are not interested in helping
good people, but rather help only those who make entreaties, both
parties act irresponsibly. When humans and devas lack virtue and act
irresponsibly, they both face ruin according to a law of nature that
governs both the human realm and heaven. {959}</p>
<p>Here is a concluding passage by the Buddha on this subject of the
divine:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Abstention from fish and meat, life as a naked ascetic, shaving of the
head, life as a matted-hair ascetic, smearing [the body] with ashes,
wearing rough leopard skins, fire worship, undertaking religious
practices in order to become a god, ascetic practices of this world,
propitiatory offerings, sacrifices, seasonal sacred observances: none
of these things purify a person who has not overcome doubt.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn51-1"><a href="#fn-fn51">51</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Sn. 44-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<h3 id="three-stages-of-development"><a class="header" href="#three-stages-of-development">Three Stages of Development</a></h3>
<p>The community of Buddhist disciples consists of many individuals who
begin their spiritual journey from different starting points and are
walking on different stages of the same path, leading to the same
destination. These individuals are at different levels of development in
the ’noble teaching’ (ariya-dhamma). By acknowledging this diversity
among people, one is able to provide individuals with suitable
assistance for their specific circumstances.</p>
<p>In relation to the subject of divine beings, this journey or development
consists of three stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a dependence on and solicitation to divine beings;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a friendly coexistence with divine beings; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a receiving of honour and veneration from divine beings.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Level one can be considered a pre-developmental stage; level two signals
the beginning stage of joining a Buddhist or ’noble’ community; and
level three is the stage of development of a person who has reached the
goal of Buddhism.</p>
<p>To be called a Buddhist, one must pass beyond the stage of reliance on
devas to the stage of friendly coexistence. One will then conduct one’s
life by making effort based on reasoned judgement. One ceases relating
to devas as powerful beings who need to be petitioned and flattered, and
instead one considers devas as virtuous companions with whom one should
maintain mutual kindness and respect. (See
Note <a href="#note-respect-for-devas">Respect for Devas</a>) In this respect, humans and devas
should not overly associate with one another, interfere in each other’s
affairs, or conspire together to cause harm to anyone.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Respect for Devas</span><a id="note-respect-for-devas"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thai Buddhists in the past who believed in devas would inform the
devas or the guardian spirits before acting in a way that might
trouble them. This behaviour can be taken as evidence for an
adaptation from the propitiation of devas by the brahmins to a
Buddhist way of practice.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that the propitiation of devas is proliferating in
Thailand, despite the warning by Buddhist leaders to abandon this
behaviour. This probably results from not knowing the proper
relationship to devas as taught in Buddhism. Consequently, the two
factions of those who believe in devas and those who deny the
existence of devas engage in disputes. Despite these disputes, there
are always those who maintain their belief in devas, and those who
speculate about the belief in devas. These believers often do not know
any way to behave towards the divine other than through supplication.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In regard to psychic powers (including sacred or occult powers),
spiritual development also consists of three stages: (1) dependence; (2)
development of psychic power; and (3) complete freedom.</p>
<p>The first stage consists of a fascination in and reliance on external,
supernatural powers. A person at this stage wastes time and effort and
lacks reasoned judgement. This stage can be considered
’pre-developmental’ or ’ignoble’.</p>
<p>The second stage consists of developing the ability to master psychic
powers. These powers are used to support wholesome actions, for example
by helping people who are in danger, and to assist in the ’miracle of
instruction’. {960} At this second stage auspicious or sacred objects
are used to provide encouragement and reassurance.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn52-1"><a href="#fn-fn52">52</a></sup> They act as
reminders, strengthening people’s resolve to perform good actions and
increasing self-confidence. Although one can say that this stage is the
beginning of a Buddhist way of life, the Buddha did not promote the
development of psychic powers because it can easily drag one back to the
first stage.</p>
<p>In the third stage, a person is free. Here, one does not rely on
supernatural forces or other external factors to provide encouragement,
because one’s mind is steadfast. One has control over one’s mind and
lives free from anxiety. At the very least one’s confidence in the
Triple Gem is complete and this provides one with security. A person who
has reached this stage truly understands the principles of Buddhism.
People should hasten to progress to the third stage, recollecting the
teaching in the suttas describing the attributes of an excellent lay
follower:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>He is not superstitious and believes in kamma;<br />
He seeks results from kamma,<br />
Not from auspicious powers.</em></p>
<p><em>A. III. 206.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3 id="stage-of-freedom"><a class="header" href="#stage-of-freedom">Stage of Freedom</a></h3>
<p>The most important task in helping people to develop through these
stages is to offer teachings, and traditionally the principal spiritual
teachers in Buddhist communities have been the bhikkhus. The speed and
extent of spiritual development depends on both the teacher and the
student. Teachers have different levels of skill in teaching; likewise,
students’ capabilities and spiritual faculties vary.</p>
<p>The aim of teaching is for people to reach the third stage, of freedom.
If the teacher is skilled at teaching and the student is ready, it may
only require one meeting between the two to lead the student from the
first stage of dependency to the third stage of freedom. The greater the
skill of the teacher, the faster the student’s development.</p>
<p>Usually, to lead students out of established ways of thinking and to
help them progress, a teacher must connect to them at their present
level of development, or he must provide them with something familiar in
order to establish trust. When the teacher lacks special powers for
establishing confidence, then he must personally guide the students from
their present level of spiritual development to higher levels.</p>
<p>In the context where the monks are the primary teachers, it is natural
that they have different abilities in regard to teaching. It is most
probably for this reason that concessions were made to the monastic
discipline, in which it became acceptable to incorporate aspects of the
second stage, of skilful engagement with supernatural phenomena. The
principle behind such concessions is to use those things that people
attach to, as a starting point when providing instruction. The first
step in this process is to dislodge these things from their original
place of importance and to steer the person in a more suitable
direction. At the same time, these things can be used constructively, as
a way to spark interest in people, while leading them to eventually pass
beyond them. {961}</p>
<p>This way of practice is evident in the training rule laid down by the
Buddha concerning stepping on ceremonial cloth. At one time, Prince
Bodhi (Prince Bodhirājakumāra) had just finished building a palace and
he invited the Buddha along with the community of monks to have a meal
there. The prince ordered that white cloth be spread on the first step
of the stairway leading into the palace. When the Buddha arrived he
refrained from stepping on the cloth and consequently the prince had the
cloth removed, after which the Buddha entered. Later, the Buddha laid
down a rule forbidding monks from stepping on such cloth.</p>
<p>On another occasion a woman who had just had a miscarriage invited the
monks to her house and having laid down a cloth she asked the monks to
step on it as a blessing. The monks, however, refused to do so. The
woman was upset and publicly criticized the monks. When this story
reached the Buddha he amended the training rule, allowing monks to step
on ceremonial cloth as a blessing when requested to do so by laypeople.
(See
Note <a href="#note-ceremonial-cloth">Ceremonial Cloth</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Ceremonial Cloth</span><a id="note-ceremonial-cloth"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vin. II. 127-9; M. II. 91. The commentaries (VinA. VI. 1209; [MA.
3/299]; DhA. III. 133) explain that Prince Bodhi had no children and
had the cloth laid down with the determination that if the Buddha
stepped on the cloth this would augur the birth of a child. The Buddha
knew that the prince would not have children and therefore did not
step on the cloth. He laid down the training rule to help future
generations of monks. In the time of the Buddha there were many monks
who could read people’s minds and they could respond according to the
thoughts of the lay donors, while later monks would not have this gift
and would not know how to respond appropriately. The laypeople would
therefore accuse them of not being adept like the monks of old. The
Buddha laid down the training rule to protect these later monks.</p>
<p>The commentaries go on to explain that in the case of a woman who has
had a miscarriage or who is just about to give birth, the request to
step on cloth is made for a blessing and is thus permissible. In the
first instance, the request was made as a vow and a form of prophesy,
while in the second instance the request was made as a form of
blessing.</p>
<p>A simple explanation for why the Buddha refrained from stepping on the
cloth at the palace is that he was acting out of good manners. When he
arrived at the palace he had not yet washed his feet and he did not
wish to spoil the cloth (there is a sub-clause in the rule allowing
monks to step on the cloth if they have washed their feet). In the
case of the woman, the Buddha allowed monks to step on the cloth
because she specifically requested that they do so as a blessing.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This allowance by the Buddha is probably the origin why monks in more
recent times have acquiesced to the requests by laypeople to perform
auspicious ceremonies, produce amulets, and engage with other sacred
objects (see
Note <a href="#note-auspicious">Auspicious Objects</a>), to the extent that in some periods of
time this involvement seems to have exceeded what is appropriate.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn53-1"><a href="#fn-fn53">53</a></sup>
{962} In any case, if monks understand the spirit of the training rule
mentioned above, of conducting auspicious ceremonies only when
specifically requested to do so by laypeople, then any harm or
immoderate behaviour will be avoided.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Auspicious Objects</span><a id="note-auspicious"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Auspicious objects (<em>maṅgala</em>) differ from supernatural powers, but
from a practical perspective, for example in relation to their
advantages and disadvantages and to the correct relationship to these
things, they have many similarities. Supernatural powers entail an
exceptional ability by the person who possesses them.</p>
<p>Auspiciousness, however, can be derived from different sources: one
may believe that the auspicious person or object possesses some kind
of sacred or supernatural power; one may believe that the person or
object is a medium or channel for some mystical power; or one may
believe that the person or object possesses a virtue, happiness, or
purity that bestows holiness or blessedness, as many Buddhist
laypeople believe is the case with the bhikkhus.</p>
<p>Auspicious objects are closely associated with the ’base arts’
(<em>tiracchāna-vijjā</em>; ’pseudo-knowledge’, which is distinct from
supernatural powers), because many people believe that these base arts
are the origin of good fortune. If a monk performs these base arts to
seek material gain this is considered wrong livelihood and immoral
conduct (as defined by the teaching on ’great morality’ –
<em>mahā-sīla</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Similar concessions can be made in relation to divine beings. The second
stage of development can be incorporated by allowing Buddhists to honour
devas, especially in the context of a society in which devas are
traditionally worshiped. Even oblations to devas are supported in the
suttas, but with the stipulation that these offerings are given out of
kindness or with a sense of service, not as supplication or with the
wish for a reward.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn54-1"><a href="#fn-fn54">54</a></sup></p>
<p>When one goes to live in a new place, one should first offer support to
those virtuous people in the surrounding area and then establish the
mind in generosity, sharing whatever merit one has accrued with the
local celestial beings. Having received this tribute, the devas will
respond with kindness:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Whatever devas there are who receive this offering [of respect],<br />
They will respect him in turn.<br />
Having received honour from him,<br />
They will likewise honour him.<br />
They care for him as a mother cares for her child.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn55-1"><a href="#fn-fn55">55</a></sup></em></p>
<p><em>Vin. I. 229-30; D. II. 88-9; Ud. 89.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In any case, the kindness reciprocated by the devas is unsolicited; the
person who offers respect need not petition for it. Our duty is simply
to establish a heart of kindness and to share whatever goodness we have
with others. Someone who understands this principle will think of the
devas with benevolence. When one performs meritorious deeds, one shares
this merit with them. There is no harm in this behaviour; it will merely
enhance the quality of the mind and spread goodness and peace throughout
the world. Even when one is unable to pass beyond the second stage, if
one maintains this principle of kindly coexistence and does not fall
back to currying favour with divine beings, one’s behaviour will
automatically remain within wholesome boundaries and prevent one from
causing harm. In addition, one’s mind will be enhanced.</p>
<h3 id="proper-relationship-to-the-supernatural"><a class="header" href="#proper-relationship-to-the-supernatural">Proper Relationship to the Supernatural</a></h3>
<p>In sum, the Buddhist way of practice in relation to supernatural powers,
divine beings, and auspicious phenomena is not complicated. If one’s
behaviour is in line with Dhamma then one can conduct one’s life
normally.</p>
<p>In Thai society it is common to hear about divine beings, sacred
objects, and miracles. One may wonder whether these things exist or not,
and if they exist how one should relate to them. In this context, one
should develop self-confidence, stop fretting about these questions, and
undertake the practice that is correct in all circumstances – a
practice that can be perfected in one’s own mind. {963}</p>
<p>In relation to divine beings, one should act with kindness, goodwill,
and respect. One should develop gentleness, wishing that all beings –
including devas – who are companions in this world, be happy. In
society, one meets both kinds of people: those who believe in and rely
on devas, and those who disbelieve and look down with contempt on both
devas and those who believe in them. Members of both factions are often
in conflict with one another. If one has the opportunity, one should
encourage members of both groups to find the middle ground of expressing
kindness, both to devas and to each other.</p>
<p>While engaged in personal activities, one should make the utmost effort
to act in accord with the law of cause and effect. If one is still
concerned about divine assistance, one may consider that if one
possesses sufficient goodness, and if virtuous and benevolent devas do
indeed exist, then one may leave such assistance up to them: the devas
themselves will decide and act on their own initiative. For one’s own
part, one performs one’s duties to the best of one’s ability – to the
extent that one’s mindfulness and wisdom permits – and one thus grows
in wisdom and virtue, so that one reaches the third stage of
development, at which stage one reaches complete freedom and is worthy
of the devas’ veneration.</p>
<p>Rather than acting virtuously with the express wish that devas will
revere us, or taking up an unyielding stance in relation to devas, which
is a form of conceit, we should do good for our own sake and for our own
reasons. The ensuing respect is up to the devas to show from their own
volition, because devas possess the virtuous quality of respecting
goodness in others.</p>
<p>As for psychic powers (<em>iddhi</em>) and auspicious powers (<em>maṅgala</em>), we
should maintain the same attitude, the only difference being to change
the response of kindness to a personal proficiency in such powers. The
initial psychic powers that we should develop are perseverance and
reasoned discernment, which lead to a fulfilment of our
responsibilities. Similarly, the auspicious powers we should develop are
those virtues and skills which enhance our lives and lead to peace and
happiness.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn56-1"><a href="#fn-fn56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>Monks, who are normally the spiritual leaders in a Buddhist community,
should be very cautious when dealing with supernatural phenomena. Those
monks who are proficient in teaching may be able to lead people to
higher levels of spiritual development quickly. But some monks, although
they teach people to abandon their former beliefs, stop at this point
and do not teach them how to give rise to wisdom and to see the path
ahead. These people then have neither faith nor wisdom, and drift around
aimlessly – a risk both to themselves and to society.</p>
<p>Those monks who are not adept at teaching and who use people’s
attachments to supernatural phenomena as a starting point for
instruction should be aware of several points.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn57-1"><a href="#fn-fn57">57</a></sup> As for psychic
powers, the Buddha laid down a clear rule forbidding monks from
exhibiting such powers to laypeople. And as for sacred objects or
ceremonies, to begin with, monks should determine not to use these
things as a means for making a living or seeking material gain, which is
wrong livelihood and a stain on moral conduct. {964}</p>
<p>There are several important considerations that have a direct bearing on
the subject of teaching:</p>
<p>First, the involvement with supernatural phenomena or sacred objects is
for the purpose of helping people become free from them. For example, a
monk uses psychic powers to free people from a reliance on such powers.</p>
<p>Second, at whatever point a teacher begins to teach, he or she must
continually lead the student forward from that point until the goal of
freedom is reached. One must not regress to former levels of practice.
The fascination with supernatural phenomena should decrease or at least
not increase; the teacher should not encourage a preoccupation with
these things. The teacher helps the student to reduce his or her
fascination with these things and to understand their limitations; in
this way the student completely passes beyond the first stage, of
dependence on them. Apart from this, one should remember the Buddha’s
allowance for monks to participate in auspicious ceremonies only when
specifically asked by laypeople, which helps to further delineate the
suitable boundaries for involvement with these things.</p>
<p>Third, whenever there is an opportunity, the teacher should offer
teachings that lead to complete deliverance from mental impurity and the
round of rebirth; these teachings will hasten and help direct the
student’s spiritual development.</p>
<p>For those people who are developing from the first stage (of dependence)
to the second stage (of self-mastery), a teacher should establish the
following limitations as to the amount of concessions or compromises he
or she makes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The practice should not be one of prayer to or dependence on
external, supernatural forces (i.e. the teaching should be one of
self-reliance and independence).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The practice should not lead to an obsession with supernatural
phenomena or to an expectation that outside forces will intervene
and therefore there is no need to act (i.e. the teaching should
emphasize individual effort in line with the law of cause and
effect).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="unstinting-spiritual-development"><a class="header" href="#unstinting-spiritual-development">Unstinting Spiritual Development</a></h3>
<p>When these limitations on teaching have been set down, the way of
practice regarding supernatural phenomena can be outlined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is permissible to become involved with supernatural phenomena,
including sacred objects and auspicious ceremonies, but one gives
them a new meaning: one enables people to develop power within
themselves: spiritual power (<em>dhamma-iddhi</em>), ’noble power’
(<em>ariya-iddhi</em>), and the blessings arising from Dhamma practice. For
monks, the most basic form of involvement in the auspicious
ceremonies of laypeople is to use these ceremonies as a means of
encouragement (i.e. to support goodness) and to promote effort.
Supernatural phenomena should not interfere in the making of wise
and reasonable effort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The relationship to divine beings is one of friendly coexistence.
Concessions are made to allow making offerings (<em>bali</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn58-1"><a href="#fn-fn58">58</a></sup> to
devas in the sense of offering respect or assistance (not as a
propitiatory offering, a supplication, or a request for
favours).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn59-1"><a href="#fn-fn59">59</a></sup> {965}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The more concessions one makes in this area of supernatural phenomena,
the more important it is to be cautious. Lay Buddhists should especially
take care in this regard. Monks should continually remind the lay
community of the hazards of attaching to these things, because due to
the busyness of their lives the laity have less opportunity to be
immersed in Dhamma teachings and can easily be led astray.</p>
<p>Every individual engaged in Dhamma practice should be aware that he or
she is still in the developmental stages of spiritual practice. At any
given time one should remember at what stage one presently is. One
should reflect in this way: ’Even if at this current time I am still
captivated by the subject of devas and blessings, I hope that one day I
can reach the stage of complete freedom.’ In a nutshell, one should
reflect: ’I must progress, not stagnate.’</p>
<p>The word ’progress’ has a special importance for the initial stage of
Buddhist practice,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn60-1"><a href="#fn-fn60">60</a></sup> because there is always the risk of falling away
from the Buddhist community and reverting back to ’ignoble’ ways. At
this initial stage there are many things that are shared between the
Buddhist way of practice and the teachings of pre-Buddhist religions,
and in some cases, as in the case with auspiciousness (<em>maṅgala</em>) and
spiritual offerings (<em>bali</em>), these things are essentially the same. The
difference lies only in the guidelines governing interaction with these
things and the range of application.</p>
<p>If one is careless and forgets the proper relationship to supernatural
phenomena, one may easily revert back to a contrary position and fall
away from the true Buddhist community (I fear this is the case for many
people). For this reason, it is very important that the concept of
’progress’ is added to one’s reflections on the proper manner of
behaviour in relation to the supernatural.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn61-1"><a href="#fn-fn61">61</a></sup></p>
<p>Whenever people reach stage three (of freedom) then they are truly safe,
because they enter the ’noble’ community: they have reached the level of
stream-entry or a higher level of realization. At this stage people do
not hesitate or revert back to a former stage; because they have reached
the heart of the Triple Gem and have confidence in the law of causality,
they only move forward, to the point of unshakeable faith. They do not
rely on external conditions, for example sacred objects or divine
powers, for security, and they have no serious defilements that would
cause them to do evil or give rise to major problems. They have
experienced a refined happiness that springs from inner peace and
establishes them in faultless conduct. These excellent qualities of
virtue, joy, and freedom, which are impervious to external influences,
induce the devas to honour and pay respect to these individuals and
engender a life of blessings: supreme blessings abide within these noble
beings.</p>
<p>Of all living beings, humans have the greatest aptitude for being
trained. They are able to train their bodies and their minds, and are
able to accomplish the most refined, elaborate and astonishing
things.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn62-1"><a href="#fn-fn62">62</a></sup> To waste time expecting assistance from supernatural or
divine powers is heedless and neglectful behaviour, allowing one’s human
potential to slip away in vain. As a consequence one will not develop on
the noble path. On the other hand, people who are diligent and careful,
who hasten to train themselves without delay, will acquire both psychic
and divine powers and will reach the supreme state, an achievement that
neither supernatural powers nor divine beings can provide. {966}</p>

<h2 id="appendix-2-assistance-and-provocation-by-indra"><a class="header" href="#appendix-2-assistance-and-provocation-by-indra">Appendix 2: Assistance and Provocation by Indra</a></h2>
<p>Indra’s assistance does not stem entirely from his own sense of
goodness, but appears also to be his duty, because in many instances his
throne heats up as a warning and thus forces him to act. This matter of
Indra’s throne heating up demonstrates a transition from earlier,
pre-Buddhist ideas of people pressuring the gods through the undertaking
of religious austerities, to the Buddhist principle of effectuating
change through the power of virtue. In this period of transition, Indra
is still influenced by coercion through ascetic practices. {968}</p>
<p>In the scriptural stories describing the way of coercion, Indra’s
conduct is that of competition and a vying for power, for example his
attempts to disturb the ascetic practices of people, which obviously
does not accord with the Buddhist way of practice.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn102-1"><a href="#fn-fn102">102</a></sup> There are,
however, many stories in which Indra’s conduct accords (to various
degrees) with a Buddhist way of practice.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn103-1"><a href="#fn-fn103">103</a></sup> Furthermore, as depicted
in these Jātaka tales, Indra does not offer assistance easily. Most
often he begins by testing people to see whether they are truly virtuous
and upright.</p>
<p>The Mahājanaka Jātaka in particular describes the Buddhist way of
practice. This story recounts how, when a ship broke apart in the middle
of the ocean, almost all the passengers cried out in fear and petitioned
the gods for help.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn104-1"><a href="#fn-fn104">104</a></sup> The Bodhisatta alone did not cry out or beg for
help from the devas. Instead, he used sound judgement and made maximum
effort to escape the danger. In the end, Maṇimekhalā the guardian deva
of the ocean offered assistance by her own initiative in keeping with
the devas’ responsibility.</p>
<p>Besides checking up on people himself, Indra also has an entourage of
guardian spirits who help to inspect and report back on people’s
behaviour.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn105-1"><a href="#fn-fn105">105</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="appendix-3-asseverations-of-truth-a-viable-solution-for-people-dependent-on-supernatural-powers"><a class="header" href="#appendix-3-asseverations-of-truth-a-viable-solution-for-people-dependent-on-supernatural-powers">Appendix 3: Asseverations of Truth: a Viable Solution for People Dependent on Supernatural Powers</a></h2>
<p>A practical solution for those at beginning stages of spiritual
development – those who are still fascinated by or dependent on
supernatural powers – is to apply the traditional Buddhist method of an
’asseveration of truth’ (<em>sacca-kiriyā</em>). This involves invoking the
truth or referring to the truth as a governing power: to direct
attention to the goodness one has previously performed and accumulated,
or to simply reflect on the truth of one’s present state of being, and
then to apply the truth as a power for dispelling danger, when all other
avenues for addressing the danger are exhausted.</p>
<p>This method of practice is considered to be close to a truly Buddhist
way of practice; it does not undermine the making of effort and it is
not an entreaty to an external creative power. On the contrary, this
practice increases confidence in one’s own virtue and effort and it
leads to greater strength of heart. Moreover, one does not need to get
mixed up with sacred objects or sacred ceremonies, which lead to
complication and complexity. {969}</p>
<p>The Buddhist commentaries, especially the Jātaka tales, contain many
stories involving an asseveration of truth (many of these stories verge
on the fantastic, but this is normal for literary texts), for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>verifying the true parents of a child (JA. I. 135.);</p>

however, it is claimed that this escape resulted from the power of
lovingkindness);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a child remembering his mother’s devotion and honesty in order to
escape from a stampeding buffalo (MA. I. 200; SA. II. 147; DhsA.
100.);</p>

<li>
<p>Ven. Aṅgulimāla wishing for the wellbeing of a woman who is about to
give birth (MA. III. 336; referring to M. II. 103.);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>King Mahākappina crossing a river on horseback (SA. II. 245; AA. I.
321.);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a queen crossing a river on horseback (DhA. II. 124.);</p>
</li>

Buddha (AA. I. 265.);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curing a child who was bitten by a poisonous snake (AA. II. 249.);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curing a husband from illness (AA. III. 349; in the Pali Canon,
however, it is claimed that the recovery resulted from listening to
a Dhamma talk offered by the wife at A. III. 297.);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and divining whether beings who are truly ’worthy of offerings’
exist or not. (AA. IV. 181. [Trans.: a person worthy of offerings’
= <em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em>; this term refers to awakened beings.])</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The practice of making asseverations of truth is a measuring stick for
the stability of ethical conduct in society. A decrease in this
tradition of asseverations of truth may point to a decline in social
ethics, because when people lack virtue giving rise to self-confidence,
they are likely to revert back to a dependence on and supplication to
supernatural phenomena like divine powers. It is probably because of
such a weakness in ethical conduct that we see the persistence and
prevalence of primitive forms of religious practice today, for example
the making of propitiatory offerings, supplication, curses and spells.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-4-was-the-buddha-human-or-divine"><a class="header" href="#appendix-4-was-the-buddha-human-or-divine">Appendix 4: Was the Buddha Human or Divine?</a></h2>
<p>When followed and correctly understood, the Buddhist guidelines
concerning divine beings enables Buddhists to live harmoniously with
those people who still worship divinities, while at the same time they
enable Buddhists to safeguard their own principles. Some people raise
the objection that such an open-minded stance puts Buddhism at a
disadvantage, because people generally lack self-confidence and are
disinclined to use their critical faculties, and for this reason they
are easily converted to a religious teaching of supplication to divine
powers. {970} This may indeed be a weak point requiring consideration,
but problems are more likely to stem from whether people have followed
the Buddha’s guidelines and continue to improve their understanding of
them or not. Because people are easily led astray, it is even more
important that Buddhists are careful to protect and maintain their
principles.</p>
<p>It is acceptable for Buddhist laypeople to join in the veneration (but
not entreaty) of divine beings, but they should not bestow on these
divine beings a power that is greater than the human potential inherent
in every person. However elevated a divine being may be, it is the ideal
human being – the Teacher<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn106-1"><a href="#fn-fn106">106</a></sup> of devas and human beings – who is
supreme. If one feels uneasy with the thought that the divinity that one
has previously worshipped would venerate a human being, one can look at
the Buddha from a different perspective: as someone who has developed
himself to the highest degree and transcended the state of being either
a god or a human, as borne out by the following story from the Pali
Canon (this passage contains a play on words; I have retained the
idiomatic expressions for the reader to consider):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>At one time, while the Buddha was on a journey travelling alone, a
brahmin who was travelling on the same road was amazed when he saw the
symbol of a wheel set within the Buddha’s footprints. The brahmin
followed the footprints and saw the Buddha sitting peacefully at the
foot of a tree by the side of the road; he went up to him, and asked:</p>
<p>’Shall your reverence be a deva?’ The Buddha replied:</p>
<p>’No brahmin, I shall not be a deva.’</p>
<p>’Then your reverence shall be a gandhabba?’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn107-1"><a href="#fn-fn107">107</a></sup></p>
<p>’No, I shall not be a gandhabba.’</p>
<p>’Then shall your reverence be a yakkha?’</p>
<p>’No, brahmin, I shall not be a yakkha.’</p>
<p>’Then shall your reverence be a human being?’</p>
<p>’No, brahmin, I shall not be a human being.’</p>
<p>’Now when I asked whether your reverence shall be a deva or a

<p>The Aṅguttara Nikāya states that the Buddha could declare having
realized the unsurpassed, supreme enlightenment when he had perfected
the eightfold series of higher knowledge and vision of the devas
(<em>adhideva-ñāṇadassana</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>to perceive the devas’ auras;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to see the devas’ forms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to converse with the devas;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to know to which group the devas belong;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to know that the devas pass away from here and are reborn there
according to the fruits of kamma;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to know the devas’ nourish-ment and to know their experiences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to know the devas’ lifespan; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to know whether he had formerly dwelt among these devas.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn109-1"><a href="#fn-fn109">109</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Adhideva-ñāṇadassana</em> may also be translated as ’knowledge and vision
of one who surpasses the devas’ or ’knowledge and vision leading one to
surpass the devas’, because it leads a person to know the devas better
than the devas know themselves (e.g. Brahma does not know his own age
and mistakenly believes he is immortal).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn110-1"><a href="#fn-fn110">110</a></sup> <em>Adhideva-ñāṇadassana</em> is
a facet of the divine eye and is a necessary characteristic of the
perfectly enlightened Buddha, along with the other ’powers and knowledge
of the Tathāgata’ (<em>tathāgata-balañāṇa</em>), but it is not necessary for
the attainment of arahantship.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn111-1"><a href="#fn-fn111">111</a></sup> From the ancient times, even before
the time of the Buddha, people have had a deep-seated respect for divine
beings. To show the distinction of human beings, it was therefore
necessary to show how humans can surpass the devas.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-6-offerings-to-devas"><a class="header" href="#appendix-6-offerings-to-devas">Appendix 6: Offerings to Devas</a></h2>
<p>Offerings to devas (<em>devatā-bali</em>) are one of five kinds of righteous
offerings that the Buddha recommended for laypeople.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn112-1"><a href="#fn-fn112">112</a></sup> The other
four are: aid for relatives (<em>ñāti-bali</em>), welcome gifts for guests
(<em>atithi-bali</em>), the making of merit in honour of the departed
(<em>pubbapeta-bali</em>), and support of the Crown, e.g. the payment of taxes
(<em>rāja-bali</em>). <em>Bali</em> is one of only few words originally used in
Brahmanism that the Buddha adopted (i.e. that were accepted into the
Buddhist teachings) without having its meaning changed (in this case the
meaning changed only slightly). There are other words like <em>yañña</em> and
<em>tapa</em> which were used but their meanings were changed considerably.
This is because <em>bali</em> originally has had the meaning of offering
sacrifice as a form of assistance or support (as well as respect). In
Brahmanism, these offerings (<em>bali</em>) were made to devas, spirits, human
beings, and even to birds and other animals. The offerings consisted of
rice, buttermilk, flowers, scented oil, incense, sandalwood, betel,
spices, etc. There is a passage in the Ratana Sutta urging the devas to
cultivate lovingkindness towards and protect those people who make
offerings.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn113-1"><a href="#fn-fn113">113</a></sup> The commentaries explain that the sharing of merit
(<em>patti-dāna</em>) – to have other beings take part in the act of goodness
– is one (Buddhist) definition for <em>bali</em>, and the fact that the Canon
advocates this form of offering demonstrates how people assist the
devas. The devas who receive these offerings should have gratitude and
protect people in return.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn114-1"><a href="#fn-fn114">114</a></sup></p>

<p>For the objective of this form of practice, see: A. III. 169.
This kind of psychic power is a form of ’deliverance of mind by way
of lovingkindness’ (<em>mettā-cetovimutti</em>), by which the person has
reached the level of ’radiant liberation’ (<em>subha-vimokkha</em>). It can
arise by developing the seven factors of enlightenment (<em>bojjhaṅga</em>)
accompanied by lovingkindness (S. V. 119), by developing the four
factors of mindfulness (S. V. 294-6), or by developing concentration
(S. V. 317-8). A person who practises in this way is sometimes

<p>The term ’sacred object’ (Thai: <em>sing sak-sit</em> –

meaning. Of the things that fall under this category, those that are
permissible by the Buddha are probably the things called <em>maṅgala</em>

term <em>maṅgala</em> provides a well-defined boundary and corresponds to

that acquiescence without setting down firm principles and
boundaries is detrimental, but Buddhism does take a strong position
and lay down clear boundaries on issues such as supernatural
phenomena. The problem lies with whether we understand the Buddhist
standpoint correctly. Granted, even with well-defined principles,
the act of acquiescence has some harmful consequences. In any case,

supernatural have been explained earlier in this chapter. <a href="#fr-fn53-1">↩</a></p>

<p>There are two important points concerning the making of offerings
(<em>bali</em>) to devas as referred to in these scriptural passages: (1)
the Buddha gave these teachings to brahmins, whose custom it was to
make sacrificial offerings to divine beings; and (2) it was the
belief at that time that whenever people built an important house or
building, devas would on their own accord come and dwell in these
buildings. People did not build a special place (e.g. a spirit
house) for these devas and they did not perform a ritual of inviting

<p>Trans.: on the play on words, Bhikkhu Bodhi has this to say:
’The brahmin’s question uses the future tense <em>bhavissati</em>, but it
is difficult to tell whether he actually intended the question to
refer to the Buddha’s future or used the future form simply as a
polite mannerism. Possibly there is a word play going on, the
brahmin using the future in the polite sense, the Buddha
deliberately speaking as if the future was literally intended.’

<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Although human beings are made up of the five aggregates, which can be
further subdivided into numerous subsidiary factors, generally speaking,
in everyday life, people do not directly engage with these aggregates.
Many of these component factors making up human life exist and function
without people’s knowledge, and even if they are aware of them, people
often do not give them much thought. In respect to the body, for
example, many physical organs function without the knowledge of the
person involved, who often does not care to know. People may only take
an interest in these functions when there arises some abnormality or
impairment. This is similarly the case in regard to mental factors.</p>
<p>People generally leave the study and analysis of the body as the
responsibility of medical scholars and biologists, and they leave the
study of the mind up to Abhidhamma scholars and psychologists. For the
majority of people, the importance or meaning of life centres around
their everyday engagement and interaction with the world. The importance
of life for most people lies in their relationship to the world.</p>
<p>This engagement or relationship can be divided into two parts or
systems, both of which rely on specific ’doorways’ (<em>dvāra</em>; ’channel’)
for making contact with the world:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cognition and experience of the world by way of the six sense doors
(<em>phassa-dvāra</em>; ’doorways of sense contact’; ’sense bases’): the
eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. These sense doors cognize
various properties and attributes of the world, namely, the six
sense objects (<em>ārammaṇa</em>): forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangible
objects, and mental objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Behaviour and response to the world relying on the three channels of
action (<em>kamma-dvāra</em>): the body (<em>kāya-dvāra</em>), speech
(<em>vacī-dvāra</em>), and mind (<em>mano-dvāra</em>), resulting in physical
actions (<em>kāya-kamma</em>), verbal actions (<em>vacī-kamma</em>), and mental
actions (<em>mano-kamma</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that in the context of active engagement in everyday life, the term
<em>dvāra</em> (’sense doors’) in the first system is most often referred to in
the scriptures by the term <em>āyatana</em>, which means ’sphere of cognition’
or ’path of cognition’. For this reason, in this analysis here, the term
<em>āyatana</em> is used instead of <em>dvāra</em>.</p>
<p>In regard to the second system, the entire engagement here pertains to
the fourth aggregate – the aggregate of volitional formations
(<em>saṅkhāra</em>) – which was discussed in the previous chapter. The myriad
volitional formations, which can be classified as wholesome,
unwholesome, and neutral, manifest and function when they are selected,
induced, and authorized by intention (<em>cetanā</em>) – their leader and
representative – to behave or act by way of body, speech and mind,
resulting in physical deeds, speech, and thoughts. {29}</p>
<p>In this context, volitional formations are reclassified in three ways:
(1) according to the chief or representative factor (i.e. of intention);
(2) according to the pathway by which they are expressed; and (3)
according to the specific action performed, as shown on
Figure <a href="#fig-intention-and-action">Intention and Action</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">Intention and Action</span><a id="fig-intention-and-action"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/intention-and-action.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>In the previous chapter on the five aggregates, volitional formations
(<em>saṅkhāra</em>) as the factors determining the quality and attributes of
the mind have already been discussed. In chapters 4 and 5 of
<em>Buddhadhamma</em>, covering the process of human life and human activities,
a detailed explanation of volitional formations will be presented in
regard to their role in shaping behaviour and responding to the external
world. In this present chapter, the focus is thus restricted to the
first system above, namely, the nature and proper functioning of the six
sense doors.</p>
<h2 id="nature-of-the-six-senses"><a class="header" href="#nature-of-the-six-senses">Nature of the Six Senses</a></h2>
<p>The term <em>āyatana</em> literally means ’link’ or ’sphere’. In this context
it refers to ’cognitive link’, ’sphere of cognition’, ’source of
awareness’, or ’doorway of perception’. There are six such doorways: the
eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>One may then ask, ’To what are these senses linked?’ The answer is that
they are linked to the world, to the external environment. Yet the world
only reveals limited parts or aspects of itself to human beings,
depending on people’s faculties or instruments of cognition, that is,
depending on the six senses mentioned above. For this reason, each one
of the six senses is paired with a specific ’object of awareness’ in the
external world. {30}</p>
<p>These objects of awareness are also referred to by the term <em>āyatana</em>,
because they too act as a cognitive link or as a source of awareness.
Yet, as opposed to the six internal senses (internal <em>āyatana</em>) just
mentioned, these objects exist in the external world (external
<em>āyatana</em>).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, these six external sense objects – visual forms,
sounds, smells, tastes, tangible objects, and mental objects – are
referred to by the term <em>ārammaṇa</em>, which literally means ’something
that detains the mind’ or ’something that holds attention’. Simply
speaking, they are ’objects of attention’.</p>
<p>When an internal sense base (<em>āyatana</em>; ’sphere of cognition’) comes
into contact with an (external) object of attention (<em>ārammaṇa</em>), an
awareness specific to that individual sense sphere arises.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> When the
eye comes into contact with forms, the awareness of ’seeing’ arises;
when the ear contacts sounds, the awareness of ’hearing’, etc. This
awareness is called ’consciousness’ (<em>viññāṇa</em>): the awareness of sense
objects.</p>
<p>There are thus six kinds of consciousness, corresponding to the six
sense faculties and the six sense objects: eye-consciousness (i.e.
seeing); ear-consciousness (i.e. hearing); nose-consciousness (i.e.
smelling); tongue-consciousness (i.e. tasting); body-consciousness (i.e.
touching); and mind-consciousness (i.e. awareness of mental objects):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eye (<em>cakkhu</em>) is the sphere for cognizing form (<em>rūpa</em>), giving
rise to seeing (<em>cakkhu-viññāṇa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ear (<em>sota</em>) is the sphere for cognizing sound (<em>sadda</em>), giving
rise to hearing (<em>sota-viññāṇa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nose (<em>ghāna</em>) is the sphere for cognizing odours (<em>gandha</em>), giving
rise to smelling (<em>ghāna-viññāṇa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tongue (<em>jivhā</em>) is the sphere for cognizing tastes (<em>rasa</em>), giving
rise to tasting (<em>jivhā-viññāṇa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Body (<em>kāya</em>) is the sphere for cognizing tangibles (<em>phoṭṭhabba</em>),
giving rise to tactile awareness (<em>kāya-viññāṇa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mind (<em>mano</em>) is the sphere for cognizing mental objects
(<em>dhamma</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> giving rise to awareness of mental objects
(<em>mano-viññāṇa</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This can be expanded as:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>6 sense bases (internal <em>āyatana</em>): eye, ear, nose, tongue, body,
mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 sense objects (external <em>āyatana</em>): form (visible objects),
sound (audible objects), smell (odorous objects), taste (sapid
objects), touch (tangible objects), mind-objects (cognizable
objects).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6 kinds of consciousness: eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body- and
mind-consciousness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>D. III. 243-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Although the arising of consciousness is dependent on the contact
between a sense base and its respective sense object,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> the fact that
a sense object becomes manifest to a sense base does not invariably
result in consciousness. Other accompanying factors, such as
receptivity, determination, and interest must also be present.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> For
example, while a person is asleep, agitated, absentminded, focused on an
activity, or highly concentrated, various visual forms and sounds within
range of potential awareness are neither seen nor heard. {31} Similarly,
when one is focused on writing a letter or a book, one may not be aware
of the contact between one’s body and the chair or between one’s fingers
and the pen. In such cases, when sense bases and sense objects are in
contact, but without the arising of consciousness, ’cognition’ is not
yet said to have occurred.</p>
<p>Cognition arises when all three factors are present: a sense base
(<em>āyatana</em>), a sense object (<em>ārammaṇa</em>), and consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>).
The technical term in Pali for the union of these three factors is
<em>phassa</em> (alternatively, <em>samphassa</em>). Although this term literally
means ’contact’, in Buddhism it refers specifically to the coming
together or convergence of these three factors. In this context <em>phassa</em>
may be translated as ’cognition’. This contact or cognition is divided
into six kinds, according to the specific sense sphere involved, i.e.:
eye-contact (<em>cakkhu-samphassa</em>), ear-contact (<em>sota-samphassa</em>),
nose-contact (<em>ghāna-samphassa</em>), tongue-contact (<em>jivhā-samphassa</em>),
body-contact (<em>kāya-samphassa</em>), and mind-contact (<em>mano-samphassa</em>).</p>
<p>This contact is a vital stage in the wider cognitive process. Once
contact with an object has occurred, other mental and physical dynamics
follow in its wake. To begin with, there is a feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) in
response to that object, followed by recognition, associated thinking,
and various actions of body, speech, and mind.</p>
<p>The feelings or sensations (<em>vedanā</em>) arising immediately after contact
with an object are of special interest in this analysis of people’s
interaction with the world. The term <em>vedanā</em> refers to sense
experience, to experiencing the ’flavour’ of sense impressions. These
sensations are either pleasurable, painful, or neutral.</p>
<p>If classified according to the pathways of cognition, there are six
kinds of feeling, corresponding to the six sense bases: feelings arising
from eye-contact, feelings arising from ear-contact, etc.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> If
classified according to the quality of feeling, however, there are three
kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sukha</em>: pleasurable, easeful, comfortable, agreeable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkha</em>: painful, uncomfortable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Adukkhamasukha</em> (also referred to as <em>upekkha</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> neutral;
neither pleasant nor painful.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This latter division is sometimes expanded into five kinds of feeling:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sukha</em>: physical pleasure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkha</em>: physical pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Somanassa</em>: mental pleasure; joy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Domanassa</em>: mental pain; sorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Upekkhā</em>: neutral feeling; neither pleasure nor pain. {32}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The cognitive process up to this point can be outlined as follows:</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">The Cognitive Process (Simple Form)</span><a id="fig-cognitive-process-simple"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/cognitive-process-simple.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>The objects of awareness (<em>ārammaṇa</em>) are equivalent to those aspects of
the world apparent to human beings by way of the sense bases
(<em>āyatana</em>). The awareness of these objects is necessary for people to
engage with the world and to survive.</p>
<p>Feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) is an essential factor in this process, indicating to
people both what is dangerous and should be avoided, and what is
supportive and should be sought out. Feeling thus promotes a
comprehensive understanding of things.</p>
<p>For unawakened people, however, the role of feeling does not end here.
Feeling is not merely one factor in the cognitive process which enhances
knowledge and enables them to live a virtuous life. For them, feeling
also implies that the world provides them with some form of compensation
or reward for engaging with it. This reward is the pleasure and delight
(referred to as <em>sukha-vedanā</em>) derived from sense objects.</p>
<p>If people seize onto feeling in this manner, they depart from the
natural cognitive process and provide another dynamic the opportunity to
take over. Feeling becomes a principal agent giving rise to subsequent
factors within this new dynamic. The natural cognitive process functions
in conjunction with this new dynamic, but it is distorted by its force
and deviates from the truth.</p>
<p>This new dynamic unfolds very easily. Basically, if contact with a sense
object provides pleasure (<em>sukha-vedanā</em>), a desire (<em>taṇhā</em>) for that
object arises. This desire leads to attachment and latent clinging
(<em>upādāna</em>). One is unable to lay down the object, even though in truth
it is impossible to appropriate it, since it has already passed one by
and vanished. At this stage, one is mentally preoccupied, creating
various ideas and conceptions on how one may possess the pleasurable
object, and planning how to obtain it. Finally, one performs various
physical and verbal actions in order to reach one’s desired goal and to
access the pleasurable feelings.</p>
<p>Conversely, if contact with a sense object leads to painful or
uncomfortable sensations (<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>), one is discontent and
annoyed. One desires to escape from or to eliminate the object (=
<em>taṇhā</em>). One is preoccupied and fixated on that object (= <em>upādāna</em>) in
a negative sense, predisposed towards aversion, fear, and avoidance. One
reacts further by yearning for and obsessing over pleasurable feelings,
pursuing those things one believes will provide pleasure.</p>
<p>This new dynamic produces a complex and desperate cycle of joy and
sorrow, which is concocted by human beings themselves and which spins
around repeatedly, beginning with this link of feeling (<em>vedanā</em>). This
is one interpretation of the ’cycle of rebirth’ (<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>).
People get caught in this whirlpool, and are unable to reach superior
states of mind, which are available and attainable as a human being.</p>
<p>The link in the cognitive process following on from contact (<em>phassa</em>)
is thus highly significant. One may say that this is the critical or
turning point in the process. Feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) plays a crucial role at
this stage. The subsequent factors in the cognitive process depend on
the kind of role that feeling plays at this point. Here, there are a
couple of matters to consider: {33}</p>
<p>First, the link following on from contact is a critical juncture, which
acts as the fork in the road between a pure cognitive process and the
so-called ’round of rebirth’ (<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>).</p>
<p>Within a pure cognitive process, feeling is simply a minor factor,
helping to bring about correct and accurate knowledge.</p>
<p>Within the ’round of rebirth’, however, feeling is a predominant factor,
dictating the entire process. It is valid to say that feeling (<em>vedanā</em>)
shapes all of unawakened peoples’s thoughts and actions – people’s
lives are determined by feeling. Within this process, people do not
experience sense impressions merely to learn about the world and to
engage with it in a healthy way, but they also begin to view the world
as something to be consumed.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, within a pure cognitive process, the link of
feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) is removed or considered inconsequential. Here,
cognition is completed with contact (<em>phassa</em>). The following stage is
referred to as the process of knowing and seeing (<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>), or the
process of ’turning away’ (<em>vivaṭṭa</em>), which is the opposite to the
’round of rebirth’ (<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Second, the link following on from contact is a critical juncture in
terms of ethical conduct. It is the decisive turning point between good
and evil, between wholesome and unwholesome, and between liberation and
spinning around in the cycle of rebirth.</p>
<p>At this point we should return to the subject of the sense bases
(<em>āyatana</em>), because all of the cognitive factors so far discussed rely
on and begin with the sense bases. These sense bases thus also play a
vital role in the cognitive process. For example, they are the source of
feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) or the channels enabling the arising of feeling.
Human beings aim for and desire feeling, and the sense bases make it
possible to experience feeling.</p>
<p>In sum, the sense bases serve human beings in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They are the pathways for experiencing the world; they are the locus
where aspects of the world are submitted to human beings. They are
the instruments for communication, providing people with raw data
for understanding. They are thus essential for helping people engage
successfully with the world, to live well, and to survive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are the channels for ’consuming’ the world; they are the
doorways that people open in order to experience the sweetness and
pleasures of the world and to seek amusement, by seeing sights,
hearing sounds, smelling fragrances, tasting flavours, touching
tangibles, and fantasizing over agreeable thoughts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These two functions are connected. The first is the principal or basic
function, which is necessary. The second function is secondary; one can
say that it is ’extra’ or ’excessive’. {34}</p>
<p>In both cases, the sense bases operate in the same way. The difference
lies in the factor of intention, whether people aim for knowledge or
whether they aim for sensation (<em>vedanā</em>).</p>
<p>For unawakened beings, the importance of the sense bases tends to be
centred on the second function, of consuming sense impressions. The
first function then becomes simply an accessory or accomplice in
fulfilling the second. In other words, cognition acts as a servant for
consuming the world or for propelling the cycle of rebirth. Ordinarily,
people use their senses to gather only that specific knowledge that
helps them to obtain and experience delicious and delightful sense
objects. They are generally not interested in securing knowledge beyond
this function.</p>
<p>Moreover, the physical, verbal, and mental behaviour of unawakened
beings is also performed out of service to the cycle of rebirth. That
is, people tend to act, speak, and think in order to seek and obtain
pleasurable sense impressions.</p>
<p>The more dimwitted people are, the greater is their entanglement with
this second function, to the point that people’s entire lives revolve
around the six sense bases.</p>
<p>Although the six sense bases are only one part of the five aggregates
and do not comprise the entirety of human life (as the five aggregates
do),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> they play a vital role for people and are highly influential in
directing people’s lives. One can say that life as ordinary people know
it is defined by their engagement with the world by way of the six
senses. The six senses give meaning to people’s lives. If the six senses
do not function properly, life becomes meaningless – the world ends.</p>
<p>The following passage from the Pali Canon provides a concise yet
complete description of this process, and helps to integrate the
explanations of the five aggregates (from the previous chapter) with the
subject here of the six senses:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting
of the three is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling.
What one feels, that one perceives. What one perceives, that one
thinks about. What one thinks about, that one mentally proliferates
(<em>papañca</em>) over. With what one has mentally proliferated over as the
source, diverse and complex perceptions (<em>papañca-saññā-saṅkhā</em>) beset
a person with respect to past, future, and present forms cognizable
through the eye.</p>
<p>(The same is true for the remaining five pairs of sense bases/sense
objects.) {35}</p>
<p><em>M. I. 111-12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This process can be illustrated in this way:</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">The Cognitive Process</span><a id="fig-cognitive-process"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/cognitive-process.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>With the arising of diverse and complex perceptions (<em>papañca-saññā</em>),
there is an increase in elaborate and embellished thinking, giving rise
to such defilements as lust, aversion, possessiveness, and
jealously.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="nota-bene"><a class="header" href="#nota-bene">Nota Bene</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The term <em>papañca</em> refers to an engagement and entanglement with
specific sense objects; it also refers to proliferative thinking
driven by the force of craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), conceit (<em>māna</em>), and
wrong view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>), or thinking that compensates these three
mental impurities. Here, a person conceives of things in terms of
’me’ and ’mine’, building a sense of self-identity or conceiving of
things in line with personal opinions. These thoughts appear in
myriad and elaborate ways, leading to various complex perceptions
(<em>papañca-saññā</em>) that are associated with these mental
proliferations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are two stages of perception (<em>saññā</em>): the first stage is
initial perception, which perceives those objects that arise
naturally on their own. The second stage – <em>papañca-saññā</em> – is
perception based on mental formations (<em>saṅkhāra</em>), which fabricate
myriad and elaborate images or concepts in relation to sense
objects, as mentioned above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entire cognitive process can be divided into two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first part, from the internal sense bases to feeling,
comprises a pure cognitive process; all of the inherent factors
arise according to natural causes and conditions. At this stage
there is no ’being’, ’person’, or ’self’ involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The latter part, from feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) onwards, comprises the
process of consuming the world or the round of rebirth
(<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>). (In fact, feeling – <em>vedanā</em> – can also
constitute the initial stage of the process of turning away
(<em>vivaṭṭa</em>), but here the focus is on the round of rebirth.) In
this latter process, there are not only natural causes and
conditions at work, but there now arises a ’person’ or ’being’.
A dualistic relationship is established between a ’consumer’ and
the ’consumed’, between a ’thinker’ and ’conceptualized ideas’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of consuming the world illustrated above is only one of
several ways to depict this process. It has been selected here
because it is concise and it corresponds to the subjects presently
being explained, i.e. the five aggregates and the six sense bases.
Another description of the round of rebirth is the detailed teaching
of Dependent Origination, which is a comprehensive model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strictly speaking, the factors of consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>), contact
(<em>phassa</em>), feeling (<em>vedanā</em>), and perception (<em>saññā</em>) are
classified as ’conascent factors’ (<em>sahajāta-dhammā</em>): they arise
simultaneously. The linear presentation above is provided for the
sake of simplicity. {36}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The cognitive process can be divided into two parts, and the latter part
itself can be further divided into either the ’round of rebirth’
(<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>) or the ’process of turning away’ (<em>vivaṭṭa</em>), as
illustrated on
Figure <a href="#fig-revolving-or-turning-away">Rounds of Rebirth or Turning Away</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">Rounds of Rebirth or Turning Away</span><a id="fig-revolving-or-turning-away"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/revolving-or-turning-away.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Another term used to refer to the six internal sense bases (<em>āyatana</em>)
or sense doors (<em>dvāra</em>) is <em>indriya</em>, which translates as ’faculty’ or
’governing faculty’. This term refers to the predominant or principal
agent in a specific action. The eye, for example, is the principal agent
in cognizing forms, and the ear is the principal agent in cognizing
sounds. The six faculties are: the eye-faculty (<em>cakkhundriya</em>), the
ear-faculty (<em>sotindriya</em>), the nose-faculty (<em>ghānindriya</em>), the
tongue-faculty (<em>jivhindriya</em>), the body-faculty (<em>kāyindriya</em>), and the
mind-faculty (<em>manindriya</em>).</p>
<p>The term <em>indriya</em> is generally used when referring to the active
engagement of the sense bases, to their operation in everyday life, and
in the context of virtuous conduct, for example: ’restraint of the
eye-faculty’. The term <em>āyatana</em>, on the other hand, is generally used
when referring to specific factors within a causal process (e.g.:
’dependent on the eye and visual forms, eye-consciousness arises’), and
also when referring to characteristics of the senses (e.g.: ’the eye is
impermanent’).</p>
<p>Another term frequently used for the sense bases when explaining
specific factors within a causal process is <em>phassāyatana</em>, which
translates as the ’source of contact’ or the ’origin of contact’.</p>
<p>Alternative terms referring to the external <em>āyatana</em> – the sense
objects (<em>ārammaṇa</em>) – include <em>gocara</em> (’resort’, ’place for gaining
sustenance’) and <em>visaya</em> (’bond’, ’attachment’, ’sphere of
engagement’).</p>
<p>Another very important term, used only in reference to the first five
sense objects, which are highly influential in the process of consuming
the world or in the round of rebirth, is <em>kāma-guṇa</em>, translated as:
’cords of sensual pleasure’, ’strands of sensual pleasure’, ’alluring
and enticing features’, ’delicious (or ’positive’) aspects of
sensuality’. This term refers specifically to those forms, sounds,
smells, tastes, and tangible objects that are desirable, attractive, and
pleasurable. {37}</p>
<h2 id="buddhist-epistemology"><a class="header" href="#buddhist-epistemology">Buddhist Epistemology</a></h2>
<p>In the discussion of the cognitive process it is apt to include here a
short description of different kinds of knowledge.</p>
<p>According to Buddha-Dhamma, there are many different ways to classify
knowledge:</p>
<h3 id="types-of-knowledge"><a class="header" href="#types-of-knowledge">Types of Knowledge</a></h3>
<p>This classification corresponds to the teaching on the five aggregates
(<em>khandha</em>). Knowledge is a form of mentality (<em>nāma-dhamma</em>), and
various aspects of knowledge are found in three of the ’aggregates of
mentality’ (<em>nāma-khandha</em>), namely the perception aggregate
(<em>saññā-khandha</em>), the volitional formations aggregate
(<em>saṅkhāra-khandha</em>), and the consciousness aggregate
(<em>viññāṇa-khandha</em>). There are three distinct kinds of knowledge
classified according to the aggregates: perception (<em>saññā</em>),
consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).</p>
<p><strong>1. Perception</strong> (<em>saññā</em>): This refers to all forms of knowledge
within the domain of the perception aggregate, that is, perception along
with knowledge stemming from perception. This includes the gathered and
stored perceptions that become the raw material for thought and enable
recognition, remembering, understanding, and contemplation.</p>
<p>According to the objects noted or perceived, perception is divided into
six kinds: perception of form (<em>rūpa-saññā</em>), perception of sound
(<em>sadda-saññā</em>), perception of smell (<em>gandha-saññā</em>), perception of
taste (<em>rasa-saññā</em>), perception of tangible objects
(<em>phoṭṭhabba-saññā</em>), and perception of mind objects (<em>dhamma-saññā</em>;
perception of thoughts).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>According to how perceptions are formed, they can be roughly divided
into two stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Basic or initial perception: direct perception of the features and
characteristics of things as they are, for example one perceives
green, white, black, red, hard, soft, sour, sweet, round, flat,
long, and short.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> This also includes perceptions linked to
conventional designations (<em>paññatti</em>), for example: ’cat’, ’desk’,
and ’chair’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overlapping or supplementary perception: perception resulting from
mental conceptualization,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup> or perception in accord with various
levels of knowledge and understanding, for example one perceives
something as beautiful, revolting, despicable, impermanent, or
nonself. This supplementary or secondary perception may be further
subdivided into two kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Perception resulting from unwholesome mental proliferation
(<em>papañca-saññā</em>); muddled or convoluted perception stemming
from the elaborate embellishment by craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), conceit
(<em>māna</em>), and wrong view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>). The commentaries refer to
it as ’defiled perception’ (<em>kilesa-saññā</em>): perception tinged
with mental defilement.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup> {38} It is perverted by defilement
and thus deviates from the path of knowledge. Rather than
fostering understanding, it breeds greed, hatred, and delusion,
and it distorts or obstructs understanding. Examples of this
kind of perception include: perceiving those features one
considers despicable; perceiving those features that answer to
covetousness; perceiving those attributes that feed a sense of
self-importance; perceiving attributes in others whom one
considers inferior; and perceptions of ultimate ownership and
control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perception resulting from wholesome thinking; perception
springing from correct understanding. This perception is
referred to as wholesome perception (<em>kusala-saññā</em>), perception
conducive to knowledge (<em>vijjābhāgiya-saññā</em>), or by other
similar terms. It fosters the development of wisdom and the
growth of wholesome qualities. Examples of this kind of
perception include: perceiving those attributes that foster
friendship; and perceiving those attributes that reveal the
state of causality, the state of impermanence, the state of
nonself, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Arahants<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup> have perception, but it is perception free from mental
taints (<em>āsava</em>), free from defilement (<em>kilesa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup> Arahants are
able to identify proliferative perception (<em>papañca-saññā</em>) as
experienced by unawakened people, or as they themselves used to
experience it before their full awakening, but they do so simply for the
sake of knowledge or in order to benefit others, for example when
helping others to solve their problems. With these perceptions by
arahants, there is no sense of being personally disturbed or affected.
General Dhamma practitioners can model their own behaviour on this
conduct by the arahants.</p>
<p><strong>2. Consciousness</strong> (<em>viññāṇa</em>): All knowledge that is part of the
consciousness-aggregate (<em>viññāṇa-khandha</em>); the principal form of all
knowledge and awareness, which is the constant function of the mind.
Consciousness is aware of all mental activity, as explained in Chapter
1.</p>
<p><strong>3. Wisdom</strong> (<em>paññā</em>): This is the principal form of knowledge
contained within the volitional formation aggregate
(<em>saṅkhāra-khandha</em>). This factor too was already explained at length in
chapter 1.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup> Besides this chief form of knowledge, there are many
other factors within the group of volitional formations that are related
to the principle of knowledge and understanding. These factors are
related to wisdom, either by supporting it, by acting as intermediary
factors in wisdom development, or by acting as criteria for revealing
the presence, absence, diminishment, or increase of wisdom. Most
notably, these factors are:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Faith</strong> (<em>saddhā</em>): belief; conviction; confidence; inspiration.
Although faith is not itself a form of knowledge, it can act as a
gateway to knowledge. Faith implies accepting the knowledge of
others, trusting in others’ wisdom, and being willing to rely on
other people’s knowledge, or other sources of knowledge, as a
personal guide. If the person endowed with faith is able to reflect
and to apply an initial reserve of wisdom, faith can lead to an
understanding of the truth. This is particularly valid when the
other person’s knowledge, or the other source of knowledge, is
accurate and genuine, and when there is a virtuous friend
(<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>) to advise in how to properly apply wisdom. On the
contrary, however, if a person is gullible – that is, he is unable
to apply wise reflection – and the people (along with other sources
of information) he associates with are misguided, and he is without
virtuous friends or has evil-minded friends, the results may be the
opposite. He may be led to greater misunderstanding and
delusion.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup> {39}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>View</strong> (<em>diṭṭhi</em>): knowledge according to one’s own notions and
viewpoints. <em>Diṭṭhi</em> is an important stage in the development of
wisdom. It follows on from a dependence by faith on other people’s
knowledge, at which stage one arrives at one’s own personal
understanding or reasoned discernment. View (<em>diṭṭhi</em>) and faith
(<em>saddhā</em>) are often closely related, or they are two aspects of a
single matter: the entrusting oneself to others’ knowledge and the
willingness to follow them (with devotion) is faith; the adoption of
those aspects of knowledge or of others’ advice, and identifying
them as one’s own is ’view’. The important attribute of view is
adhering to something as one’s own.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>The knowledge classified as ’view’ (<em>diṭṭhi</em>) ranges from the
irrational, to the moderately rational, to the highly rational. When
view is developed to the point of correct knowledge and
understanding – that which corresponds with reality – it is called
’right view’ (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>) and is designated as ’wisdom’
(<em>paññā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup> When one develops wisdom to the point of clearly
discerning the nature of things, one no longer needs to seize this
understanding as one’s own. This is because the truth exists in a
neutral, objective way; it does not depend on anyone’s assertions or
affirmations. It lies beyond the stage of ’view’.</p>
<p>Because view tends to be linked with personal attachments, it often
produces harmful effects. If one’s attachment is strong and
unyielding, despite one’s views being very close to the truth, they
will end up being an impediment, preventing one from realizing the
truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Delusion</strong> (<em>moha</em>; ignorance): <em>moha</em> is a synonym for <em>avijjā</em>;
both of these terms refer to an ignorance of the truth and a lack of
understanding in regard to reality. This ignorance is the opposite
of wisdom (<em>paññā</em>), particularly the specific form of wisdom called
’true knowledge’ (<em>vijjā</em>). One can say that delusion is the basic
state of existence for human beings, who are encouraged to dispel it
by way of true understanding (<em>vijjā</em>), or by way of wisdom
development.</p>
<p>Although one may study an extensive amount of technical knowledge
(’arts and sciences’), and apply this knowledge in various
enterprises, if it does not help one to understand things as they
truly are – does not lead one to a true discernment of the
conditioned world – it remains on the level of formal learning
(<em>suta</em>): ’that which has been transmitted’; ’that which one has
heard’. It is not yet true wisdom. It is unable to dispel ignorance
or delusion, and it is unable to solve the basic predicament of
life. It may solve some problems, but occasionally it breeds new
ones. Take the example of someone who desires light and goes off in
search of large quantities of kindling and fuel. No matter what this
person does with these items, say by arranging them in various
decorative patterns, as long as he has not ignited a flame, no light
will shine forth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wisdom must be generated, cultivated, and gradually developed. There are
many stages or levels of wisdom, and there are numerous important Pali
terms used to refer to wisdom: either to specific stages of wisdom,
specific attributes of wisdom, or specific origins of wisdom. Here is a
list of some of these terms: <em>pariññā</em> (’thorough knowledge’), <em>ñāṇa</em>
(’clear knowledge’), <em>vijjā</em> (’true knowledge’), <em>aññā</em> (’gnosis’),
<em>abhiññā</em> (’supreme knowledge’), <em>buddhi</em> (’intelligence’), <em>bodhi</em>
(’awakening’), and <em>sambodhi</em> (’full awakening’). {40}</p>
<p>The distinction between perception (<em>saññā</em>), consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>),
and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>) was explained in chapter 1. There is, however, one
point to reiterate here:</p>
<p>Consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>) is a <em>pariññeyya-dhamma</em>: it is something to
be recognized and understood; our only task is to understand it as it
is. We have no responsibility beyond this, because no matter what we do,
consciousness functions according to its own nature.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, perception (<em>saññā</em>) is also a <em>pariññeyya-dhamma</em>:
something to simply understand as it is.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup> Perception resulting from
unwholesome mental proliferation (<em>papañca-saññā</em>), or ’defiled
perception’ (<em>kilesa-saññā</em>), however, is a <em>pahātabba-dhamma</em>:
something to be abandoned or eliminated.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup> Perception supportive to
understanding and to fostering wholesome qualities is a
<em>bhāvetabba-dhamma</em>: something to be cultivated, increased, and
perfected.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Wisdom (<em>paññā</em>) is a <em>bhāvetabba-dhamma</em>: something to be trained and
developed, until it can be used to completely dispel delusion and
ignorance.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="pathways-of-cognition"><a class="header" href="#pathways-of-cognition">Pathways of Cognition</a></h3>
<p>According to Buddha-Dhamma, ’contact’ (<em>phassa</em>) is the source of
knowledge: all forms of understanding arise as a result of contact, or
they arise at the point of contact (see
Note <a href="#note-contact-consciousness">Contact and Consciousness</a>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup> That is, knowledge is
dependent on cognition, whereby data passes through the six ’spheres’
(<em>āyatana</em>) or doorways (<em>dvāra</em>) of cognition: the eye, ear, nose,
tongue, body, and mind.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Contact and Consciousness</span><a id="note-contact-consciousness"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically speaking, contact (<em>phassa</em>) is not a condition for the
knowledge referred to as ’consciousness’ (<em>viññāṇa</em>), because
consciousness is one of the factors involved for the arising of
contact. For this reason, these sutta passages cited above do not
state that <em>phassa</em> is the cause for the arising of the consciousness
aggregate (<em>viññāṇa-khandha</em>); rather, they state that materiality and
mentality (<em>nāma-rūpa</em>) is the cause for its arising. The expression
in English, ’contact is the source of all knowledge’, is still valid,
however, since the term ’source’ can refer both to ’cause’ and a
’place from which something is obtained’.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>If one considers the six sense spheres as the starting points of
cognition, one can classify knowledge into two kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Knowledge obtained by way of the five sense doors (<em>pañca-dvāra</em>):
the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. This refers to basic forms of
knowledge, i.e. knowing visual forms (including colours), sounds,
smells, tastes, and tangibles (<em>phoṭṭhabba</em>; these can be summarized
as: ’earth’ (<em>paṭhavī</em>): the state of solidity; ’fire’ (<em>tejo</em>):
heat or temperature; and ’wind’ (<em>vāyo</em>): movement, vibration, and
tension). {41}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge obtained by way of the mind door (<em>mano-dvāra</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup> i.e.
knowing mind objects (<em>dhammārammaṇa</em>; or <em>dhamma</em>, for short). This
refers to all of those things known and reflected upon by the mind.
For the sake of clarity, the Abhidhamma divides these into five
kinds:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The feeling aggregate (<em>vedanā-khandha</em>). (This refers to
feeling as something that is known by the mind. The following
four factors should be understood in the same way.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The perception aggregate (<em>saññā-khandha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The volitional formations aggregate (<em>saṅkhāra-khandha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anidassana-appaṭigha-rūpa</em>: invisible, intangible form included
in the classification of mind objects. This is also referred to
as refined form (<em>sukhuma-rūpa</em>), and it is comprised of sixteen
factors: the element of cohesion (<em>āpo-dhātu</em>); femininity
(<em>itthī-bhāva</em>); masculinity (<em>purisa-bhāva</em>); physical basis of
the mind (<em>hadaya-rūpa</em>); life-faculty (<em>jīvitin-driya</em>);
material quality of nutrition (<em>āhāra-rūpa</em>; nutritive essence
– <em>ojā</em>); space (<em>ākāsa</em>); bodily communication
(<em>kāya-viññatti</em>); verbal communication (<em>vacī-viññatti</em>); the
three qualities of alterability (<em>vikāra-rūpa</em>): levity
(<em>lahutā</em>), softness (<em>mudutā</em>; malleability), and wieldiness
(<em>kammaññatā</em>); and the four material qualities of salient
features (<em>lakkhaṇa-rūpa</em>): growth or enlargement (<em>upacaya</em>),
continuity (<em>santati</em>); decay (<em>jaratā</em>); and disintegration
(<em>aniccatā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unconditioned element (<em>asaṅkhata-dhātu</em>), i.e. Nibbāna.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Later Abhidhamma texts present a more detailed analysis of mind objects
(<em>dhammārammaṇa</em>), dividing them into six kinds:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Five sense organs (<em>pasāda</em>), i.e. the clarity or sensitivity which
acts as the cognitive medium in regard to the eye, ear, nose,
tongue, and body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sixteen kinds of refined materiality (<em>sukhuma-rūpa</em>), mentioned in
the previous list (D).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heart (<em>citta</em>; ’mind’).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental concomitants (<em>cetasika</em>); this corresponds to the feeling
aggregate, perception aggregate, and volitional formations aggregate
mentioned in the previous list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nibbāna.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paññatti</em>: established names, labels, and designations, for
example: ’earth’, ’mountain’, ’car’, ’person’, ’North’, ’South’,
’cave’, ’pond’, ’island’, ’peninsula’, etc. These names and
designations may refer to things that truly exist or to things that
only exist in the imagination. Whether the things they refer to
exist or not, however, these names and designations are timeless and
indestructible. A hole going deep into a mountain is called a
’cave’. Wherever and whenever such a hole appears, it is
consistently called a ’cave’. The term ’cave’ refers to only this
specific phenomenon. The actual cave itself (and every cave),
however, is subject to caving in or being filled in; it is subject
to change and transformation.</p>
<p>Similarly, that which is called ’perception’ arises and passes away,
and is subject to disintegration, but the label ’perception’ does
not disappear. Wherever and whenever such a phenomenon arises, it is
consistently called ’perception’ (if there is a conventional
agreement to use this term). The body is subject to decay, but the
term ’body’ remains constant. Wherever such phenomena arise, they
are referred to by such designations. Those people who do not
understand this subject of conventional designations may be puzzled
or confused when they encounter such phrases as ’feeling is
impermanent’ or ’perception is impermanent’; they are unable to
distinguish whether impermanence here refers to the actual
phenomenon or to its designation. {42}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Such highly technical explanations may be difficult to understand. On
some occasions, it is especially difficult to distinguish between
certain kinds of knowledge obtained by way of the mind-door and
knowledge obtained by way of the five senses. Yet these distinctions are
very important. For example, when one hears someone else speaking, the
knowledge by way of the five senses (in this case, the ’doorway’ of the
ear) is simply an awareness of sound – one simply hears a sound. One
does not yet understand the meaning of the words. Subsequent
understanding is knowledge arising at the mind-door. Likewise, when one
sees a rooftop, the knowledge by way of the five senses (the ’doorway’
of the eye) is simply an awareness of a shape or colour. Knowing the
condition of ’covering’ and ’sheltering’, and knowing that the object is
a roof, is achieved at the mind-door.</p>
<p>Knowledge by way of the mind, or the knowledge of mental objects
(<em>dhammārammaṇa</em>), encompasses a very wide range. It includes both the
mental awareness of data obtained by way of the five senses and
knowledge exclusive to the mind itself. To clarify this matter, here is
another format for classifying the knowledge obtained by way of the
mind-door (<em>mano-dvāra</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Objects (i.e. ’emotions’) specific to the mind, e.g.: love, anger,
confusion, mental clarity, happiness, unhappiness, grief,
depression, loneliness, delight, courage, fear, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conceptions pertaining to the past, of objects that were cognized by
way of the five senses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conceptions associated with materiality (<em>rūpa-dhamma</em>) cognized by
way of the five senses, yet not made aware of by the consciousness
(<em>viññāṇa</em>) specific to each of these senses. These include
’designations’ (<em>paññatti</em>) and conceptions of the relationship
between various material phenomena, for example: the function of
coherence, expansion, and the state of interrelationship and
interdependency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thoughts, imaginations, justifications, and judgements created as a
result of emotions (A.), conceptions pertaining to the past (B.),
and conceptions of the relationship between various material
phenomena, along with designations (C.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insight or exceptional knowledge that pervades a luminous mind. For
example, when one discerns the true relationship between various
factors, a clear understanding arises and one sees into the law of
interrelated conditions (or ’law of relativity’). This knowledge is
referred to as <em>ñāṇa</em>. An example is <em>abhiññā</em> (’supreme
knowledge’).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Unconditioned, i.e. Nibbāna.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that in the scriptures, the preferred classification of knowledge
obtained by way of the cognitive doorways is fourfold:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn30">30</a></sup> {43}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭha</em>: ’the seen’, i.e. all visible objects (<em>rūpārammaṇa</em>) and
knowledge obtained by way of seeing and watching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Suta</em>: ’the heard’, i.e. sounds and knowledge obtained by way of
hearing and listening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Muta</em>: ’the experienced’, i.e. odours, tastes, and tangibles, or
those things cognized by way of the nose, tongue, and body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Viññāta</em>: the ’realized’, i.e. mind objects (<em>dhammārammaṇa</em>): all
things known by way of the mind.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three factors constitute knowledge by way of the five senses.
This threefold division is made because seeing and hearing are critical
sources of knowledge and involve an extensive range of activity; these
two factors are thus distinguished from the rest. The three remaining
factors, pertaining to the nose, tongue, and body, share a common
attribute: here, cognition is accomplished when the sense objects –
odours, tastes, and tangibles – literally make contact with the
respective sense base. This differs from the eye and the ear, which
cognize objects that do not ’touch’ the sense base (visual objects rely
on light and sounds rely on waves as the means of conveying
information.)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Technically speaking, the knowledge obtained by way of the five senses
is very limited. In this context, however, this knowledge is defined in
a broad, general sense: <em>diṭṭha</em> refers both to that which is seen and
to all knowledge dependent on the eye and on seeing, including the
mind’s interpretation of this visual data. Yet this interpretation of
data still remains on a direct and basic level, without any additional
embellishment. <em>Suta</em> refers to that which is heard and to all knowledge
derived from hearing. This includes speech and language, which the mind
has interpreted on a basic level, but which has not yet undergone
additional conceptualization. <em>Muta</em>, too, should be understood in this
way. Technically speaking, this knowledge pertaining to the five senses
– <em>diṭṭha</em>, <em>suta</em>, and <em>muta</em> – extends as far as ’perception by way of
the five senses’ (<em>pañcadvārika-saññā</em>). All knowledge beyond that is
encompassed by the term <em>viññāta</em>: knowledge dependent on the mind door.</p>
<h3 id="wisdom-development"><a class="header" href="#wisdom-development">Wisdom Development</a></h3>
<p>The knowledge corresponding to and required for wisdom development is
referred to as knowledge ’to be developed’ (<em>bhāvetabba-dhamma</em>).
Because consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>) is a form of knowledge simply ’to be
understood’ (<em>pariññeyya-dhamma</em>; ’to be recognized’), it is not
included as a factor in this context.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of knowledge pertaining to wisdom development.
According to stages of development, or to the potency of wisdom and
understanding, they are ordered in this sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Perception</strong> (<em>saññā</em>): knowledge derived from perceiving,
remembering, and identifying the attributes of things. This
knowledge is recorded in the mind. It acts as a model for comparison
and as raw material for thinking and for subsequent understanding.
This perception can be divided into two kinds, as described earlier
(see: A. Nature of Knowing).</p>
<p>The perception arising in the normal cognitive process – both basic
perception and the perception accompanying the growth of
understanding in wisdom development – is simply a matter of either
knowing or not knowing. This is true even if one is referring to
various levels of perception, say from indistinct to lucid
perception, from partial to complete perception, or from false to
correct perception. This matter thus pertains directly to knowledge
and the development of knowledge. This is in direct contrast to the
excessive or immoderate perception known as ’proliferative
perception’ (<em>papañca-saññā</em>) or ’defiled perception’
(<em>kilesa-saññā</em>), which invariably obstructs and distorts knowledge.
{44}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>View</strong> (<em>diṭṭhi</em>): reasoned understanding; truth on the level of
conceptualization; knowledge mixed with cherished thoughts and
opinions. Here, a person draws conclusions of some kind, and
attaches to specific viewpoints as his or her own. This knowledge
may originate from an external source, but it has passed through a
screening process and is adopted as one’s own, regardless of how
logical or reasonable this knowledge may be. It can even be
illogical. Examples of view include: eternalism (<em>sassata-diṭṭhi</em>;
the view of an eternal soul); annihilationism (<em>uccheda-diṭṭhi</em>);
and the view of non-causality (<em>ahetuka-diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct knowledge</strong> (<em>ñāṇa</em>): profound knowledge; gnosis. The term
<em>ñāṇa</em> is a synonym of <em>paññā</em> (’wisdom’), but its definition tends
to be more restricted. That is, it refers to specific functions and
fruits of wisdom, for example: <em>kammassakatā-ñāṇa</em> (the insight into
how beings are the owners of their intentional actions);
<em>atītaṁsa-ñāṇa</em> (profound knowledge of the past);
<em>saccānulomika-ñāṇa</em> (knowledge in harmony with the truth);
<em>ṭhānāṭhāna-ñāṇa</em> (knowledge of the possible and the impossible);
and <em>nānādhimuttika-ñāṇa</em> (knowledge of the disposition, traits, and
beliefs of various beings). <em>Ñāṇa</em> refers to a pure and radiant
knowledge that arises spontaneously in the mind and discerns a
particular quality as it really is.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although there are many levels of <em>ñāṇa</em>, including mistaken knowledge
or incomplete knowledge, they can all be referred to as ’pure’ or
’genuine’ forms of knowledge, because they have not yet been adulterated
by self-identification or self-attachment. Occasionally <em>ñāṇa</em> arises as
a consequence of reasoned thought, but this knowledge exists independent
of such thought, because it connects with some aspect of reality that
truly exists. This is one distinction between <em>ñāṇa</em> and <em>diṭṭhi</em>. The
knowledge referred to as <em>diṭṭhi</em> relies on personal beliefs and logical
reasoning, whereas <em>ñāṇa</em> makes contact with external aspects of reality
that truly exist.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>On a basic level, perception (<em>saññā</em>) is the raw material for all
thinking and subsequent knowledge. For this reason, both view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>)
and direct knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>) rely on perception.</p>
<p>It is fairly obvious how view arises from perception. The very
perception or discernment of something urges one to establish an opinion
about it. Although perceiving the features of things is useful in
everyday life, perception is selective and often acts to conceal or
eclipse other features of these objects. If people fail to examine these
dynamics, they may be deceived by perception or allow it to obstruct
wisdom. This is the case for many people. The causes for wrong view to
arise include false perceptions and also an incorrect application of
perception.</p>
<p>The following passages from the Pali Canon describe how view arises as a
consequence of perception:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>An arahant does not possess even minor views arising from and produced
by perception, pertaining to the seen, the heard, and the experienced.
To wit: view has perception as its leader and principal agent, and it
discriminates things according to perception. An arahant, free from
mental taints, possesses no view produced by perception, created by
perception, fashioned by perception, pertaining to the seen, etc.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup>
{45}</p>
<p><em>Nd. I. 110-11 (explaining: Sn. 156-8)</em></p>
<p>There are not many diverse truths in the world, except as a
consequence of perception (resulting in diverse views).</p>
<p><em>Sn. 173.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The arising of direct knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>) is also dependent on
perception:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Perception arises first, Poṭṭhapāda, then knowledge, and from the
arising of perception comes the arising of knowledge.</p>
<p><em>D. I. 185.</em></p>
<p>The passage: ’From this you have not perceived the least sense,’ may
be explained thus: ’You have not perceived those things you have
engaged with or accomplished, nor have you perceived the
characteristics, the causes, or the effects. “From this” means “from
internal peace”, “from spiritual practice”, or “from Dhamma
teachings”. From where else will you obtain knowledge?’</p>
<p><em>Nd. I. 193 (explaining: Sn. 165-6).</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A person may watch falling leaves and consequently develop insight
knowledge (<em>vipassanā-ñāṇa</em>) and discern the impermanence of all things.
This knowledge relies on numerous perceptions as its source, for
example: perceptions of life and the sustenance of all things;
perceptions of aging and decay; perceptions of deterioration, death, and
the ending of things; and perceptions of ’above’ and ’below’. The
ability to see the relationship between these various perceptions gives
rise to knowledge. Or take an example of worldly knowledge
(<em>lokiya-ñāṇa</em>): when Isaac Newton observed the apple falling from the
tree, he developed the insight into gravity. This insight relied on
myriad perceptions, for example: perceptions of ’falling’; perceptions
of convergence; perceptions of space and force; and perceptions of
attraction, mobility, release, suspension, linearity, trajectory, etc.
The ability to clearly see the relationship between these various
perceptions gave rise to this insight into gravity.</p>
<p>Direct knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>) is able to give rise to view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>), and
superior forms of view tend to arise as a consequence of previously
accessed knowledge. A clear example of this from the suttas is the story
of the Brahma god named Baka, who was able to recall the birth of beings
for an expanse of time that appeared infinite. He observed the countless
births and deaths of other beings, while he himself remained the same.
He thus developed the view that the abode of Brahma is permanent and
eternal, and that Brahma is the creator of all things.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn34">34</a></sup> Similarly,
Newton, after his discovery of gravity, used this insight to further
observe natural phenomena, but his vision and understanding was not
comprehensive. He was still stuck at or deceived by certain things.
Knowledge and insight is thus susceptible to the attachment referred to
as ’view’ (<em>diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
<p>Conversely, view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>) supports the arising of knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>).
Many views result from contemplation and are highly logical and
reasonable. They become established as beliefs in the minds of
intelligent individuals and philosophers. For this reason, if one does
not attach to these views in an unyielding way, and one is able to
listen to others and to apply wise reflection, there is a good chance
that a deeper knowledge will arise, paving the way to spiritual progress
and removing any obstacles in the path. {46}</p>
<p>When view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>) or direct knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>) arises, new
perceptions (<em>saññā</em>) are formed accordingly. <em>Diṭṭhi</em> and <em>ñāṇa</em> thus
give rise to perception (<em>saññā</em>), which acts as the raw material for
further contemplation and understanding. The difference here is that
view tends to create false perceptions, whereas direct knowledge helps
to create accurate, correct perceptions and to dispel false
perceptions.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>The three kinds of knowledge – <em>saññā</em>, <em>diṭṭhi</em>, and <em>ñāṇa</em> –
embodied in wisdom development are related to the three methods the
Buddha described for generating wisdom:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn36">36</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Cintāmaya-paññā</em>: wisdom arising from one’s own reflection and
reasoning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sutamaya-paññā</em>: wisdom arising from learning or the transmission
of knowledge from others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em>: wisdom arising from engaging in spiritual
practice and cultivation. (See
Note <a href="#note-wisdom-factors">Factors of Generating Wisdom</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Factors of Generating Wisdom</span><a id="note-wisdom-factors"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the suttas these three factors are named but not explained. When
explaining the first two factors, the Abhidhamma focuses on
<em>kammassakatā-ñāṇa</em> (the knowledge of the personal ownership of
intentional action) and <em>saccānulomika-ñāṇa</em> (knowledge in harmony
with the truth), i.e. it focuses on insight knowledge
(<em>vipassanā-ñāṇa</em>), which arises as a result of engaging in work and
technical discipline. The Abhidhamma equates the third factor with
<em>samāpannassa-paññā</em> (the wisdom of one who possesses or
accomplishes), which the commentaries define as the ’wisdom of one who
is endowed with concentrative attainment (<em>samāpatti</em>)’, i.e. the
wisdom arising from concentration (<em>samādhi</em>). See: VbhA. 413; VismṬ.:
Khandhaniddesavaṇṇanā, Paññāpabhedakathāvaṇṇanā. But if one defines
this term in a general sense, it can mean the ’wisdom of one who
applies himself’, the ’wisdom of one who practises’, or the ’wisdom of
one who earnestly engages in an activity’. See Appendix 1.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Besides these three chief methods, there exist numerous other means for
developing wisdom. Especially in relation to the third method, these
important activities include: listening (<em>savana</em>); inquiry and review
(<em>paripucchā</em>); conversation, discussion, and debate (<em>sākacchā</em>);
observing and watching (<em>passana</em>); scrutiny (<em>nijjhāna</em>); wise
reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>; <em>yoniso-upaparikkhā</em>); evaluation
(<em>tulanā</em>); examination, investigation, and analysis (<em>vīmaṁsā</em>);
experimentation and selection (<em>vijaya</em>); repetition (<em>āsevana</em>);
cultivation (<em>bhāvanā</em>); and continuous and devoted practice
(<em>bahulī-karaṇa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>Reflection (<em>cintā</em>), learning (<em>suta</em>), and training (<em>bhāvanā</em>) help
to generate, improve, and fine-tune perception (<em>saññā</em>), view
(<em>diṭṭhi</em>), and direct knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>).</p>
<p>The learning imparted by others (<em>suta</em>), thoughts and reflections
(<em>cintā</em>), and wisdom arising from practical application (<em>bhāvanā</em>) are
all forms of knowledge inherent in an individual. The distinct and
concrete knowledge manifesting in a person’s mind, however, are the
three forms of knowledge described earlier: perception (<em>saññā</em>), view
(<em>diṭṭhi</em>), and direct knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>). One can say that perception,
view, and direct knowledge are the end results of learning, thinking,
and practical training.</p>
<p>Perception (<em>saññā</em>), view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>), and direct knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>)
have a powerful impact on people’s lives. Perception is highly
influential in the cognitive process, in discerning and comprehending
the world, and in generating other forms of knowledge. View, from
religious beliefs and various ideologies, to personal values, acts as
the guideline for people’s entire range of behaviour and way of life.
Direct knowledge is the most pristine and profound form of knowledge –
the fruit of the highest wisdom accessible to human beings. It is able
to cleanse the innate character of people, and to create or change
people’s worldview (<em>loka-dassana</em>) and outlook on life
(<em>jīva-dassana</em>). Its effects on people’s behaviour and conduct is more
lasting and definite than the effects produced by view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
<p>These forms of knowledge discussed above are related to the
classification of knowledge explained in the next section. {47}</p>
<h3 id="human-activities-and-accomplishments"><a class="header" href="#human-activities-and-accomplishments">Human Activities and Accomplishments</a></h3>
<p>This heading refers to the knowledge pertaining to human social affairs,
including: communication, imparting of information, research, symbolism,
means of showing respect, social affiliations, and the transmission of a
society’s heritage, which is the possession of all people and marks the
advancement of a particular civilization. This form of knowledge can be
divided into three kinds:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn38">38</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Suta</em> (or <em>suti</em>): knowledge that has been heard, learned, or
transmitted. It can be subdivided into two kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Knowledge heard, taught, or transmitted among human beings (in
Pali this knowledge is referred to as <em>suta</em>). Buddhism
considers this knowledge and learning to be of vital importance.
In the context of wisdom development, it is referred to as the
’instruction by others’ (<em>paratoghosa</em>; literally, the
’utterance by others’). Wholesome instruction is given great
emphasis in the teachings, as a basis and condition for right
view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn39">39</a></sup> This knowledge (<em>suta</em>) includes
formal schooling, news by way of the media, book- or textual
knowledge, and recorded history. Even the suttas in the Tipiṭaka
are a form of such knowledge. (Most of the suttas begin with the
phrase, ’Thus have I heard’ – <em>evaṃ me sutaṃ</em>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The knowledge that some religions proclaim has been revealed and
disclosed by a supreme divinity. The brahmins, for example,
believe that the Vedas were directly transmitted by Brahma. In
Pali, this form of knowledge is usually referred to as <em>suti</em>,
corresponding to the Sanskrit <em>ṡruti</em>. In Buddhism, however,
this knowledge is not considered to hold any unique distinction
and it is thus included in the term <em>suta</em>. In light of wisdom,
it is not attributed any special value; its difference lies
purely in its content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhi</em>: views; opinions; theories; doctrines; beliefs. This refers
to particular conclusions one draws about things. This understanding
is associated with personal attachments and affinities, and it has
the potential to create a sense of separation from others. Although
this factor has been discussed above, here the focus is on its role
in a social context. When personal beliefs extend outwards, and
people declare or proclaim their views, others may adopt these
beliefs, giving rise to factionalism and the creation of
institutions or schools of thought.</p>
<p>There are many Pali synonyms for the term <em>diṭṭhi</em> (Sanskrit:
<em>dṛishṭi</em>). The most important ones are: <em>khanti</em> (’compatible
idea’, ’acceptable principle’); <em>ruci</em> (’cherished idea’, ’pleasing
principle’); and <em>laddhi</em> (’acquired idea’, ’dogma’, ’tenet of
practice’, ’way of practice considered beneficial’, ’religious
belief’.)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn40">40</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ñāṇa</em>: gnosis; direct knowledge; insight; pure knowledge; knowledge
in accord with truth; wisdom resulting in a specific truth;
comprehensive knowledge of a specific matter. <em>Ñāṇa</em> is the highest
form of human knowledge and is of vital importance. Both in its
mundane and transcendent forms, <em>ñāṇa</em> is the driving force for the
development of ’noble qualities’ (<em>ariya-dhamma</em>) in human beings.
The supreme <em>ñāṇa</em> is referred to as <em>bodhi</em> or <em>bodhiñāṇa</em>:
’enlightenment’, ’awakening’. The Buddha realized ’perfect, complete
awakening’ (<em>sammāsambodhi-ñāṇa</em>), giving rise to Buddhism as the
source of great vision for the world. {48}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There exist other, miscellaneous classifications of knowledge in the
scriptures, in which various kinds of knowledge mentioned above are
combined into groups, for example this group of five factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Itiha</em> (<em>+ anussava</em>) <em>itikirā paramparā</em>: knowledge derived from

<h2 id="accurate-and-defective-knowledge"><a class="header" href="#accurate-and-defective-knowledge">Accurate and Defective Knowledge</a></h2>
<p>Although Buddhist epistemology is an extensive subject, here we will
look at only two more aspects, pertaining to correct and incorrect
knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="two-levels-of-truth"><a class="header" href="#two-levels-of-truth">Two Levels of Truth</a></h3>
<p>Students of Buddhism may experience confusion about the subject of
truth. On the one hand, they hear such teachings as: do not associate
with fools, associate with the wise; a foolish person has these
attributes, a sage has these attributes; be content with what one has,
do not covet the possessions of others; one is one’s own refuge; and one
should offer mutual support. Other teachings, on the other hand, state:
discern according to truth that the body is simply the body; it is not a
’being’, a ’person’, a ’self’, ’me’, ’you’, ’him’ or ’her’; it does not
belong to us; it is not lasting and substantial; all things are nonself
(<em>anattā</em>). These people then see these teachings as contradictory, or
else they get confused and due to a limited understanding practise in an
unbalanced, incorrect way. At times when they should speak or act
according to a basic, conventional understanding of the world, they
attach to teachings on ultimate truth, causing all sorts of confusion
and even harm for themselves and others.</p>
<p>As an attempt to prevent such confusion and erroneous behaviour, the
Abhidhamma divides the truth (<em>sacca</em>) into two levels:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Conventional truth (<em>sammati-sacca</em>): another name for this is
<em>vohāra-sacca</em>: ’rhetorical truth’, ’vernacular truth’. This refers
to consensual truth: to those things that have been mutually agreed
upon and to common designations. These designations are used as
tools for communication, for the sake of convenience and benefit in
everyday life. Examples include the designations: ’person’,
’animal’, ’good person’, ’bad person’, ’table’, ’chair’, and ’book’,
and the common words ’water’ and ’salt’. {49}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absolute truth (<em>paramattha-sacca</em>): to the extent that this truth
can be articulated in words, the descriptions are intended for fully
comprehending things as they really are. The aim here is to give
rise to the supreme benefit of penetrating the ultimate truth
(<em>sacca-dhamma</em>), an understanding which dispels all attachments,
delusions, and defilements, fosters a proper relationship to things,
brings about a freedom from suffering, and leads to true purity,
peace, and happiness.</p>
<p>Examples of absolute truths include: mentality (<em>nāma-dhamma</em>),
corporeality (<em>rūpa-dhamma</em>), feeling (<em>vedanā</em>), perception
(<em>saññā</em>), volitional formations (<em>saṅkhāra</em>), consciousness
(<em>viññāṇa</em>), the mind (<em>citta</em>), mental concomitants (<em>cetasika</em>),
material form (<em>rūpa</em>), Nibbāna, contact (<em>phassa</em>), intention
(<em>cetanā</em>), one-pointed attention (<em>ekaggatā</em>), the life faculty
(<em>jīvitindriya</em>), etc. A comparison to modern science is the
analysis of water or salt. For scientists, the terms ’water’ and
’salt’ may be deemed inadequate, ambiguous, or misleading. For more
accuracy, they thus define water as Hydrogen Oxide (H2O) and common
salt as Sodium Chloride (NaCl). (Note that this comparison does not
correspond completely to the description here of absolute truth, but
it shows how even in other branches of knowledge certain aspects of
truth are distinguished from people’s ordinary understanding and
definitions.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, the Abhidhamma, which assigns specific technical terms to
these concepts of conventional and ultimate truth, cites passages from
the suttas to substantiate its claim. This shows that these concepts
existed from the beginning. Most likely, at the time of the Buddha,
there was a basic understanding of these concepts, and it was thus
unnecessary to establish unique descriptive terms for them. The key
sutta passage cited in this context is a teaching by Bhikkhunī Vajirā:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Māra, how can you believe in a being and hold [such] a view? This is
purely a mass of formations; here, no being can be found. Just as with
the combination of various parts, the term ’wagon’ ensues, so too,
with the five aggregates the conventional term ’being’ ensues.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 135; cited at Kvu. 86-7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In relation to everyday spiritual practice, there are many passages by
the Buddha emphasizing an understanding of conventional and absolute
truths. The Buddha encouraged people to recognize language merely as a
means of communication, without attaching to conventions or becoming
enslaved by language. Here are two examples:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>An arahant with taints destroyed may say, ’I speak this way, and they
speak to me this way.’ Skilful, knowing the world’s parlance, he uses
such terms as mere expressions.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 14.</em></p>
<p>These are worldly terms, expressions, manners of speech and
designations. The Tathāgata uses these, but does not attach to them.</p>
<p><em>D. I. 202.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Note that the Abhidhamma describes the suttas – the Suttanta Piṭaka –
as a vernacular teaching (<em>vohāra-desanā</em>), because the majority of its
subject matter is comprised of conventional language. In contrast, the
Abhidhamma describes itself as an absolute teaching
(<em>paramattha-desanā</em>), because the majority of its content is a direct
presentation of absolute truths.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn42">42</a></sup> {50}</p>
<h3 id="three-aberrations-of-knowledge"><a class="header" href="#three-aberrations-of-knowledge">Three Aberrations of Knowledge</a></h3>
<p>The Pali term <em>vipallāsa</em> refers to aberrant or errant knowledge –
knowledge that deviates from the truth. It is fundamentally flawed,
leading to misunderstanding, delusion, self-deception, and an incorrect
attitude and conduct vis-à-vis one’s life and all things. It is an
impediment, shielding one from discerning reality (<em>sacca-bhāva</em>). There
are three kinds of aberrant knowledge:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Saññā-vipallāsa</em>: aberrant perception; wrong or defective
perception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Citta-vipallāsa</em>: aberrant ’mind’; wrong or defective thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhi-vipallāsa</em>: aberrant view; wrong or defective view.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of aberrant perception include: someone frightened by a piece
of rope, perceiving it as a snake; animals encountering a scarecrow and
seeing it as a real person guarding a field; someone completely
disorientated, seeing north as south, south as north; and someone
fleeing from the light of a flashing sign, perceiving it as a fire.</p>
<p>Examples of aberrant mind include: an insane person thinking grass is
food; a deranged person paranoid of others, thinking they plan to do him
harm; someone seeing a moving shadow in the dark and imagining it to be
a ghost; and the story of Chicken Little, who, after an acorn hit her on
the head, thought that the sky is falling.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>Aberrant view generally arises as a consequence of aberrant perception
and aberrant mind. When one perceives something incorrectly, one views
it incorrectly. Similarly, when one thinks in deviant and errant ways,
one’s views and beliefs are accordingly mistaken. When one wrongly
perceives a rope as a snake, one may come to the conclusion that this
particular location is teeming with snakes. When one perceives the land
as extending out evenly, in a straight line, one believes that the earth
is flat. When one thinks that an external, conscious force is required
to manage and control things, one develops the belief that gods are
responsible for thunder, lightning, earthquakes, rain, and floods.</p>
<p>These examples are relatively simple, and one can say that they pertain
to unusual situations. In the Pali Canon and in other Dhamma teachings,
however, these aberrations are examined on a refined and fundamental
level. They focus not merely on the false understanding by select
individuals or groups, but more importantly on deviant forms of
understanding that almost everyone is subject to, often unconsciously.
People tend to be dominated by these fundamental or subtle deviations.
Here, the three aberrations mentioned above are combined as a single
group:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these four aberrations of perception, aberrations of
mind, and aberrations of view. What four?:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The aberration of perception, mind, and view that takes the
impermanent to be permanent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aberration of perception, mind, and view that takes what is
suffering to be pleasurable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aberration of perception, mind, and view that takes what is
nonself to be self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The aberration of perception, mind, and view that takes what is
unattractive to be attractive.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn44">44</a></sup> {51}</p>
<p><em>A. II. 52; Ps. II. 80.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These aberrations of perception, mind, and view impede spiritual
development, and their elimination is thus an important target of wisdom
practice. Those methods of developing knowledge described earlier all
help to dispel these aberrations. Most effective for this task is an
investigation into causes and conditions and a detailed and mindful
analysis of the building blocks of conditioned reality.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn45">45</a></sup></p>

<p>Monks, I will teach you the all.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn46">46</a></sup> Listen carefully. And what is
the all? The eye and forms, the ear and sounds, the nose and odours,
the tongue and tastes, the body and tactile objects, the mind and
mental phenomena. This is called the all.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 15.</em></p>
<p>’Venerable sir, it is said, “the world, the world.” In what way, might
there be the world or the description of the world?’</p>
<p>’Where there is the eye, Samiddhi, where there are forms,
eye-consciousness, things to be cognized by eye-consciousness, there

<p>’Monks, I say that the end of the world cannot be known, seen, or
reached by travelling. Yet I also say that without reaching the end of
the world there is no making an end to suffering.’</p>
<p>[Ven. Ānanda spoke]: ’I understand the detailed meaning of this
synopsis, which the Buddha recited in brief without a detailed
exposition, as follows: by whatever means people perceive the world as
the world, and consider the world to be the world – this is called
the ’world’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</p>
<p>’And by which means do people people perceive the world as the world,
consider the world to be the world? It is by way of the eye … ear
… nose … tongue … body … and mind that people perceive the
world as the world, consider the world as the world.’</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 95.</em></p>
<p>Monks, I will teach you the origin and the passing away of the world.
Listen closely….</p>
<p>And what is the origin of the world? In dependence on the eye and
forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact.
With contact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with feeling as
condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging
as condition, becoming; with becoming as condition, birth; with birth
as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and
despair come to be. This is the origin of the world.</p>
<p>In dependence on the ear and sounds … the nose and odours … the
tongue and tastes … the body and tactile objects … the mind and
mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises…. This is the origin of
the world. {52}</p>
<p>And what is the passing away of the world? In dependence on the eye
and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is
contact. With contact as condition, feeling [comes to be]; with
feeling as condition, craving. But with the remainderless fading away
and cessation of that same craving comes cessation of clinging; with
the cessation of clinging, cessation of becoming; with the cessation
of becoming, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth,
aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair cease.
Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. This is the
passing away of the world.</p>
<p>In dependence on the ear and sounds … the nose and odours … the
tongue and tastes … the body and tactile objects … the mind and
mental phenomena, mind-consciousness arises…. This is the passing
away of the world.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 87.</em></p>
<p>’Venerable sir, it is said, “Māra, Māra,”…. It is said, “a being, a
being,”…. It is said, “suffering, suffering”…. In what way might
there be Māra or the description of Māra … a being or the
description of a being … suffering or a description of suffering?’</p>
<p>’Where there is the eye, Samiddhi, where there are forms,
eye-consciousness, things to be cognized by eye-consciousness … the
mind, where there are mental phenomena, mind-consciousness, things to
be cognized by mind-consciousness, there Māra exists or the
description of Māra … a being exists or the description of a being
… suffering exists or the description of suffering.’</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 38-9.</em></p>
<p>When the eye exists, the arahants designate pleasure and pain. When
the eye does not exist the arahants do not designate pleasure and
pain. When the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind exists, the
arahants designate pleasure and pain. When the ear … nose … tongue
… body … mind does not exist, the arahants do not designate
pleasure and pain.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 123-4.</em></p>
<p>Monks, the eye … ear … nose … tongue … body … mind is
impermanent … subject to stress (<em>dukkha</em>) … nonself. The cause
and condition for the arising of the eye … ear … nose … tongue
… body … mind is also impermanent. As the eye … ear … nose …
tongue … body … mind has originated from what is impermanent …
dukkha … nonself … how could it be permanent … inherently
pleasurable (<em>sukha</em>) … self?</p>
<p>Forms … sounds … smells … tastes … tangibles … mind objects
are impermanent … dukkha … nonself. The cause and condition for

<p><em>S. IV. 129-32.</em></p>
<p>Suppose, monks, that the rice seedlings have ripened and the watchman
is negligent. If a bull fond of rice enters the paddy field, he might
indulge himself as much as he likes. So too, the uninstructed
worldling who does not exercise restraint over the six bases for
contact indulges himself as much as he likes in the five cords of
sensual pleasure.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 195-6.</em></p>
<p>Monks, these six bases for contact – if untrained, unguarded,
unprotected, unrestrained – are conveyers of suffering…. These six
bases for contact – if well-trained, well-guarded, well-protected,
well-restrained – are conveyers of happiness. {53}</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 70.</em></p>
<p>’How is it, friend Sāriputta, is the eye the fetter of forms or are
forms the fetter of the eye? Is the ear the fetter of sounds … the
nose the fetter of odours … the tongue the fetter of tastes … the
body the fetter of tangible objects … the mind the fetter of mental
phenomena or are mental phenomena the fetter of the mind?’</p>
<p>’Friend Koṭṭhita, the eye is not the fetter of forms nor are forms the
fetter of the eye, but rather the desire and lust that arise there in
dependence on both the eye and forms: that is the fetter there…. The
mind is not the fetter of mental phenomena nor are mental phenomena
the fetter of the mind, but rather the desire and lust that arise
there in dependence on both: that is the fetter there.</p>
<p>’If the eye were the fetter of forms or if forms were the fetter of
the eye, this living of the holy life could not be actualized for the
complete destruction of suffering. But since the eye is not the fetter
of forms nor are forms the fetter of the eye – but rather the desire
and lust that arise there in dependence on both is the fetter there –
the living of the holy life can be actualized for the complete
destruction of suffering….</p>
<p>’The Blessed One has an eye, the Blessed One sees forms with the eye,
yet there is no desire and lust in the Blessed One; the Blessed One is
well liberated in mind. The Blessed One has an ear … nose … tongue
… body … mind, yet there is no desire and lust in the Blessed One;
the Blessed One is well liberated in mind.’</p>

<p>’Although, venerable sir, I am old, aged, burdened with years,
advanced in life, come to the last stage, let the Blessed One, the
Well Farer, teach me the Dhamma in brief. Perhaps I may understand the

to the Blessed One’s statement.’</p>
<p>’What do you think, Māluṅkyaputta, do you have any desire, lust, or
affection for those forms cognizable by the eye that you have not seen

<p>’I understand, venerable sir…. Having seen a form with muddled
mindfulness, attending only to the pleasing signs, one experiences it
with infatuated mind, and remains tightly holding to it. {54}</p>
<p>’Many feelings flourish within, originating from visible form, and
one’s mind becomes disturbed by covetousness and distress. For one who
accumulates suffering thus, Nibbāna is said to be far away.</p>
<p>’Having heard a sound … having smelt an odour … having tasted a
flavour … having felt a tangible … having known a mental
phenomenon with muddled mindfulness…. For one who accumulates
suffering thus, Nibbāna is said to be far away.</p>
<p>’When firmly mindful, one sees a form yet does not attach to form.
With a mind uninfatuated, one experiences feelings without enslavement
to the sense object.</p>
<p>’One fares mindfully in such a way that even as one sees the form and
while one experiences a feeling, suffering is exhausted, not built up.
For one not accumulating suffering thus, Nibbāna is said to be close
by.</p>

<p>And how, monks, does one dwell diligently? If one dwells with
restraint over the eye faculty, the mind is not distracted by forms
cognizable by the eye. If the mind is not distracted, gladness is
born. When one is gladdened, rapture is born. When the mind is
uplifted by rapture, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body
experiences happiness. The mind of one who is happy becomes
concentrated. When the mind is concentrated, phenomena become
manifest. Because phenomena become manifest, one is reckoned as ’one
who dwells diligently’. (The same is true for the remaining five sense
faculties.)</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 78-9.</em></p>
<p>Ānanda, how is there the supreme development of the faculties in the
Noble One’s Discipline? Here, when a bhikkhu sees a form with the eye
… hears a sound with the ear … smells an odour with the nose …
tastes a flavour with the tongue … feels a tangible with the body
… knows a mental object with the mind, there arises in him what is
agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises what is
both agreeable and disagreeable.</p>
<p>He understands thus: ’There has arisen in me what is agreeable, there
has arisen what is disagreeable, there has arisen what is both
agreeable and disagreeable. But that is conditioned, gross,
dependently arisen. This subsequent state is peaceful and sublime,
that is, equanimity.’ {55} The agreeable that arose, the disagreeable
that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose in him
cease, and equanimity is established.</p>
<p>Just as a man with good sight, having opened his eyes might shut them
or having shut his eyes might open them, so too concerning anyone at
all, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose, and the
both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease just as quickly, just
as rapidly, just as easily, and equanimity is established. This is
called in the Noble One’s Discipline the supreme development of the
faculties….</p>
<p><em>M. III. 299.</em></p>
<p>Bhikkhus, when one discerns the eye as it actually is, when one
discerns forms as they actually are, when one discerns and sees
eye-consciousness as it actually is, when one discerns eye-contact as
it actually is, when one discerns as it actually is the pleasant or
painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings that arise with
eye-contact as condition, then one is not caught up with the eye, with
forms, with eye-consciousness, with eye-contact, with the pleasant or
painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings that arise with
eye-contact as condition.</p>
<p>When one abides unattached, unobsessed, uninfatuated, realizing
danger, then the five aggregates affected by clinging are not
accumulated in the future; and one’s craving – which brings renewal
of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and searches for
amusement in this or that – is abandoned. One’s bodily and mental
worries are abandoned, one’s bodily and mental torments are abandoned,
one’s bodily and mental fevers are abandoned.</p>
<p>Such a person experiences bodily and mental pleasure. The view of a
person such as this is right view. His intention is right intention,
his effort is right effort, his mindfulness is right mindfulness, his
concentration is right concentration. His bodily action, his verbal
action, and his livelihood have already been well purified earlier.
Thus this Noble Eightfold Path comes to fulfilment in him by
development. (The same applies to the remaining five sense bases.)

<h2 id="practical-application"><a class="header" href="#practical-application">Practical Application</a></h2>
<p>The sense bases (<em>āyatana</em>) constitute the critical juncture between the
wholesome and the unwholesome. One path leads to heedlessness,
immorality, and an indulgence in worldly things. Another path leads to
comprehensive knowledge, skilful actions, and liberation.</p>
<p>If people fail to develop a proper understanding and conduct in relation
to the sense bases, they tend to be enticed or seduced into indulging in
worldly things. They spend most of their energy on seeking pleasing
forms, sounds, fragrances, tastes, and bodily contacts, along with
related amusements, to minister to their desires. As a result, they
increase greed, hatred, and delusion, and cause trouble and turmoil for
themselves and others.</p>
<p>It is fairly obvious how conflict, maltreatment, exploitation, and
oppression, along with other unresolved social problems, are largely a
consequence of dissolute or unrestrained lifestyles, in which people are
lured into a path of gratifying the senses, until this behaviour becomes
intensified and habitual.</p>
<p>Many people never receive any reminders or encouragement to reflect on
their behaviour and on how they cater to sense desire. They never
consciously practise sense restraint and as a result they become
increasingly heedless.</p>
<p>One aspect to resolving this ethical dilemma is to foster an
understanding in people as to the proper role and limitations of the
sense bases and the related sense objects. Another aspect is to have
people train in sense restraint, and in guiding and managing the use of
the senses for bringing about true personal and social wellbeing.</p>
<p>The sense bases are the source of pleasure and pain, of happiness and
unhappiness, which for most ordinary, unawakened people is directly
connected to their principal objectives in life and to the determined
effort they make in almost every activity. Pleasure and happiness is
actively pursued, and pain and suffering is actively avoided.</p>
<p>After exerting great effort pursuing worldly pleasures, often to the
point of exhaustion, many people find themselves disappointed, for many
reasons: their desires may remain unfulfilled; when they encounter sweet
and delicious experiences, they must also face the bitterness that life
offers – sometimes increased pleasure is overshadowed by increased
mental pain and affliction, which in the end becomes more costly than
the rewards obtained by pleasure – the pursuit of pleasure is then not
worth the effort; they may find gratification, but not as much as they
had wished; or they reach their target, but discover that happiness
continually eludes them. Some people spend their entire lives chasing
after true happiness, but never find it.</p>
<p>Many of these disappointed individuals end up in despair, wandering
aimlessly through life and ruing the past. Others go to the extreme
opposite of seeking sense pleasure, and instead they try to dissociate
from life and undergo practices of self-mortification. {57}</p>
<p>The study of the sense bases is intended for a comprehensive
understanding of the truth and for developing a correct attitude and
relationship to sense pleasure, so that it does not cause harm to
oneself and others. At the very least, these teachings provide
principles and guidelines for rectifying any problems resulting from
engagement with the senses. Besides offering a cautionary note about how
one pursues sense pleasure, one also learns about its limitations and
how it stands in relation to other forms of happiness. One is then able
to pursue more refined kinds of happiness. Moreover, the way one deals
with happiness and unhappiness is directly linked to ethical matters.</p>
<p>The sense bases and their relationship to both the cognitive process and
to wisdom development are linked to virtuous conduct from the very
start. If one acts incorrectly from the beginning, the entire cognitive
process is tainted. The process then caters to the consumption of
material things, or it becomes an aspect of the round of rebirth
(<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>). This leads to a distorted, biased, clouded, or
incorrect understanding. The supportive practice in this context is to
establish the mind in equanimity, to keep it even-keeled and impartial,
not dominated by likes and dislikes, preferences and aversions.</p>
<p>There are many other practical teachings referring to the sense bases,
either directly or indirectly. They are related to different stages of
spiritual practice, and they focus on specific problems, say of
suffering or unwholesome tendencies, that have the potential to arise on
different occasions.</p>
<p>To prevent problems from arising, the teachings reiterate caution and
restraint at the initial stage of cognition, when a sense object comes
into contact with a sense base. This is the safest course of action.</p>
<p>In the case that problems have already arisen and unskilful mind states
have infiltrated the mind, this is difficult to remedy. If one allows
enticing and alluring sense objects to take hold of the mind, and one
falls under the sway of greed, hatred, and delusion, one may not be able
to resist these enticements, and one ends up performing immoral,
unwholesome deeds. This is true even if one has a basic awareness of
right and wrong. This is the reason such emphasis is given to taking
precautions and protecting oneself from the beginning.</p>
<p>A vital spiritual factor for establishing this care and protection is
mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), which helps to anchor the mind. Mindfulness is
like a rope which holds and sustains attention. Mindfulness used at this
initial stage of care and protection while receiving sense impressions
is connected to the principle of ’sense restraint’ (<em>indriya-saṁvara</em>),
which is also referred to as ’guarding the sense doors
(<em>gutta-dvāra</em>)’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn52">52</a></sup> Here, mindfulness is fully prepared to receive a
sense impression, for example when seeing a visual form by way of the
eye. One does not allow attention to fix on those signs and features
that give rise to infatuations and resentments, preferences and
aversions, and that allow unwholesome states to over-whelm the mind.
Sense restraint prevents wrongdoing, wards off suffering, and averts
distorted understanding.</p>
<p>Using this principle of sense restraint effectively is not a simple act
of will, however. For mindfulness to be well established, fully
prepared, and constant, it must be trained and developed. Sense
restraint must be repeated, exercised, and continuously applied. This is
the meaning of the term <em>indriya-bhāvanā</em>: ’cultivating the sense
faculties’. {58}</p>
<p>Those individuals who have cultivated the sense faculties are safe from
unwholesome states, from suffering, and from distorted
understanding.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn53">53</a></sup> They are able to prevent these negative qualities
from arising. Even if preferences and aversions manage to slip in, they
are able to quell them or cast them aside instantly.</p>
<p>Sense restraint (<em>indriya-saṁvara</em>) is classified as part of the stage
of morality (<em>sīla</em>). The essential factor of mindfulness (<em>sati</em>)
applied for such sense restraint, however, is classified as part of the
stage of ’concentration’ (<em>samādhi</em>). The practice of mindfulness
involves constantly channelling the power of the mind and balancing
attention, which thus also results in the development of concentration.</p>
<p>Another spiritual factor emphasized in this context is wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), which is classified as part of wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).
This factor is applied when one has already received a sense object, at
which point one contemplates it in order to fully understand it. One
contemplates the advantages and disadvantages of various objects, along
with the state of freedom and wellbeing, in which one is not dependent
on them. The positive and negative aspects of conditioned phenomena then
do not determine our happiness or our fate. {59}</p>
<h2 id="appendix-1-three-kinds-of-wisdom"><a class="header" href="#appendix-1-three-kinds-of-wisdom">Appendix 1: Three Kinds of Wisdom</a></h2>
<p>In truth, there is only one kind of wisdom, that is, the natural
phenomenon of understanding reality, of penetrating into the truth of
things as they really are. Wisdom, however, is frequently separated into
many different kinds, according to the level of wisdom, to its specific
function, or to the specific source of understanding.</p>
<p>The three kinds of wisdom here refer to a classification connected to
the source of understanding:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sutamaya-paññā</em>: wisdom stemming from listening, reading, and
learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cintāmaya-paññā</em>: wisdom stemming from reflection and
contemplation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em>: wisdom stemming from further spiritual
cultivation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three kinds of wisdom are only seldom mentioned in the Tipiṭaka,
but they are frequently referred to in later texts. Because there is
some confusion about the meaning of these terms, it is useful to examine
some of the scriptural explanations.</p>
<p>In most presentations of these three kinds of wisdom, <em>sutamaya-paññā</em>
is placed as the first factor, but in the original texts, both in the
suttas<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn54">54</a></sup> and in the Abhidhamma,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn55">55</a></sup> <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em> comes first.
An exception to this is the Nettipakaraṇa, which in the Burmese
Theravada tradition is included in the Tipiṭaka (as part of the Khuddaka
Nikāya in the Suttanta Piṭaka); here, s<em>utamaya-paññā</em> is the first
factor.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn56">56</a></sup> In the commentaries and sub-commentaries, these three
factors are increasingly referred to as: <em>sutamaya-ñāṇa</em>,
<em>cintāmaya-ñāṇa</em>, and <em>bhāvanāmaya-ñāṇa</em> (’knowledge’, arising by way of
study, contemplation, and spiritual cultivation, respectively).</p>
<p>This is the order that they are presented in the original Tipiṭaka:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Cintāmaya-paññā</em>: wisdom arising from contemplation; wisdom arising
from wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) established within an
individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sutamaya-paññā</em>: wisdom arising from learning; wisdom arising from
the instruction by others (<em>paratoghosa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em>: wisdom arising from spiritual practice; wisdom
arising from applying the previous two kinds of wisdom and engaging
in devoted reflection and meditation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The discrepancy between having either <em>sutamaya-paññā</em> or
<em>cintāmaya-paññā</em> as the first of the three factors depends on whether
the focus is primarily on exceptional individuals, or whether it is on
the practice by general, ordinary individuals.</p>
<p>In the case where <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em> is placed first, the examination
begins with an individual referred to as a ’great man’ (<em>mahāpurisa</em>),
that is, with the Buddha (or with a ’Silent Buddha’ – <em>paccekabuddha</em>).
Such a person has discovered and revealed the truth without relying on
the instructions and teachings by others. He is able to apply wise
reflection himself, investigating, linking, and following up on
experiences in a comprehensive way, until he fathoms the truth. From
<em>cintāmaya-paññā</em>, he moves directly to <em>bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em> (he needs
not rely at all on <em>sutamaya-paññā</em>).</p>
<p>When the focus is on ordinary people, however, s<em>utamaya-paññā</em> is
placed at the beginning. Generally speaking, people study and obtain
formal knowledge, teachings, and information, which rouses faith and
confidence. They examine and inspect these teachings, leading to an
understanding of them, which is referred to as <em>sutamaya-paññā</em>. Based
on this formal learning, they evaluate and contemplate it deeper, giving
rise to a clear discernment of causality and of the interrelationship of
things. This is <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em>. When they actively and determinedly
apply these two initial kinds of wisdom and further investigate
phenomena, knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>) arises and they realize the truth. Here
the path (<em>magga</em>) gives rise to fruition (<em>phala</em>). This stage is
referred to as <em>bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em>. {60}</p>
<p>Note that for many people, although they obtain a great deal of
information (<em>suta</em>), they do not necessarily develop wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).
So in regard to the first factor, only some individuals apply their
learning to give rise to wisdom comprised of learning
(<em>sutamaya-paññā</em>).</p>
<p>In the Vibhaṅga of the Abhidhamma, <em>bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em> is defined as
<em>samāpannassa-paññā</em>, which literally means the ’wisdom of one who
endeavours’ or the ’wisdom of one who has reached fulfilment’. (The term
<em>samāpanna</em> may be variously translated as ’accompanying’,
’endeavouring’, ’completion’, or ’fulfilment’. It can be used in both a
positive and a negative sense, for example: ’accomplished in the rules
of training’; ’related to going forth (<em>pabbajjā</em>)’; ’full of envy and
greed’; ’engaging in enjoyment and play’; ’accompanied by sorrow and
lamentation’; ’brimful with a swift flowing current’.</p>
<p>In the context of Dhamma teachings, however, when this term is used on
its own, it generally refers to accessing the concentrative attainments
(<em>jhāna-samāpatti</em>). The commentary to the Vibhaṅga explains: ’The
wisdom of one endowed with the concentrative attainments, and occurring
within such attainments, is called “consisting of cultivation”.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn57">57</a></sup>
This appears to be a very narrow definition. Other texts, however,
including the Paramatthamañjusā, explain that the aforementioned
definition is only an example. The essential meaning of the term
<em>bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em> focuses on a clear discernment of the truth, which
refers to ’Path wisdom’ (<em>magga-paññā</em>) operative within insight
meditation (<em>vipassanā</em>).</p>
<p>There exists an explanation of <em>bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em> in the texts that
encompasses the concentrative attainments, yet spans a broader range of
meaning. This explanation considers the term <em>appanā</em> (’absorption’),
which refers to the concentration lying at the heart of jhāna. One
example from the Visuddhimagga states: ’Wisdom achieved by the power of
cultivation reaching absorption is called “endowed with
cultivation”.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn58">58</a></sup> This explanation is linked to the passage above,
referring to diligent contemplation of all phenomena, which is
equivalent to insight meditation (<em>vipassanā</em>). When insight wisdom
(<em>vipassanā-paññā</em>) reaches an adequate degree of clarity, the mind
reaches concentrative absorption (i.e. jhāna). This clear discernment
and steady, focused attention is able to purify and eliminate those
festering and constrictive qualities known as the defilements
(<em>kilesa</em>). The mind is thus released from some or all of these
defilements. This realization which brings about such transformation is
<em>bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em>, equivalent to ’Path knowledge’ (<em>magga-ñāṇa</em>).</p>
<p>In the Nettipakaraṇa, these three kinds of wisdom are linked to the
classification of the four kinds of individuals. Here, the spiritual
assets of the first three kinds of individuals, those who are
’trainable’ (<em>veneyya</em>), are examined, before these individuals advance
to <em>bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em>. Those people endowed with both <em>sutamaya-paññā</em>
and <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em> are called ’of quick understanding’
(<em>ugghaṭitaññū</em>): they understand instantly; they gain insight by even
hearing a single outline of a teaching. Those endowed only with
<em>sutamaya-paññā</em> are called <em>vipacitaññū</em>: they understand when they are
given an explanation. Those individuals devoid of both of these kinds of
wisdom are <em>neyya</em>: those who should be guided with teachings and
training in order to gain understanding. Those who have not reached the
stage of <em>neyya</em> and are <em>padaparama</em> (’one whose highest attainment is
the word’) are not included here.</p>
<p>Compiling these various references, one may summarize this subject of
the three kinds of wisdom as follows:</p>
<p>Those exceptional individuals (<em>acchariya-puggala</em>), comprising the
Buddhas and the Silent Buddhas, are true sages; their wisdom surpasses
that of other people. Ordinary people live in specific environments and
have various experiences for decades, centuries, and generations, and
yet their knowledge and understanding remains limited. A Buddha arises,
however, and he is able to apply wise reflection and see things from a
perspective that others are unable to see. Through investigation he is
able to penetrate the profound underlying truth of things, gain an
intuition into things that others do not recognize, make new
discoveries, develop new understanding, and finally access a truth that
no one else has realized.</p>
<p>The wisdom arising from one’s own ability to apply wise reflection is
referred to as <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em>, which the Buddhas and Silent Buddhas
possess, without needing to rely on the instructions by others. (Indeed,
no one exists who would be able to provide them with such instruction.)
This is the wisdom unique to such exceptional people. They are able to
pass over the initial stage of <em>sutamaya-paññā</em>. If such unique
individuals endowed with <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em> do not arise, revolutionary
discoveries of truth and the breaking out of the limitations of wisdom
are not possible. People then simply pass on their traditional yet
restricted knowledge.</p>
<p>Ordinary people, who do not possess <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em> derived entirely
from their own ability to apply wise reflection, must rely on the
teachings and instructions by others. The starting point for them is
generating <em>sutamaya-paññā</em>. {61}</p>
<p>Ordinary people must develop all three kinds of wisdom:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sutamaya-paññā</em>: knowledge derived from formal learning. When one
is not yet able to rely entirely on one own reflective abilities,
one must seek out a teacher, who in the scriptures is referred to as
a virtuous friend (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>), for example the Buddha, awakened
beings, and other wise individuals, for instruction and guidance.
One is then able to comprehend the truth at one level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cintāmaya-paññā</em>: knowledge derived from reflection, from the
ability to contemplate. When one acquires knowledge from formal
learning and generates wisdom consisting of such knowledge
(<em>sutamaya-paññā</em>), one trains in wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), leading to vast, profound, and thorough
understanding, which can be applied in one’s investigation of the
truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em>: knowledge derived from spiritual cultivation.
This re-fers to practical application, whereby one acts from direct
experience. Here, one relies on the first two kinds of wisdom and
furthers one’s spiritual devel-opment by applying wise reflection in
regard to all phenomena, until one realizes the wisdom established
as the Path (<em>magga</em>) and one attains fruition (<em>phala</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note here that <em>bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em> relies and follows on from
<em>sutamaya-paññā</em> and <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em>. One does not spontaneously
generate <em>bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em> without a basis of knowledge, or access it
simply by sitting in meditation and attaining the jhānas. Most people
are not even able to generate <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em> without a foundation of
formal learning (<em>suta</em>). (And as mentioned earlier, many people acquire
formal learning but do not transform it into wisdom –
<em>sutamaya-paññā</em>.)</p>
<p>Wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) is the chief agent in this
process. One can say that it is the essential factor in the development
of all three kinds of wisdom. This is true even for those exceptional
individuals like the Buddha, who begin with <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em>, without
requiring formal instruction from others (<em>paratoghosa</em>). A Buddha
begins with an inherent and exceptional talent for wise reflection,
giving rise to profound wisdom. Ordinary people apply formal learning
and then contemplate phenomena in order to grow in wisdom, until they
develop <em>bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em>, at which stage wise reflection truly comes
to the fore.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this threefold division of wisdom is found only
seldom in the Tipiṭaka. Ven. Sāriputta presented this classification in
order to highlight the sources by which wisdom arises.</p>
<p>The factor constantly emphasized by the Buddha is wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), which is the means of practice by which wisdom is
generated. When wise reflection is present, these three kinds of wisdom
may arise and reach fulfilment.</p>
<p>In sum, of those people who receive information and external knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some people only acquire facts and information, without developing
any sort of wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people are able to contemplate and examine that information,
and generate <em>sutamaya-paññā</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people establish <em>sutamaya-paññā</em>, and then reflect and inquire
further, generating <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people rely on <em>sutamaya-paññā</em> and <em>cintāmaya-paññā</em> as a
basis, and then develop wisdom further through wise reflection,
generating <em>bhāvanāmaya-paññā</em>. {62}</p>
</li>

<p>The commentators provide many different nuances of meaning for this term
<em>āyatana</em>, including: the point of transmission for the mind (<em>citta</em>)
and mental concomitants (<em>cetasika</em>), i.e. the locus of their active
engagement; the point of expansion for the mind and mental concomitants;

<p>Note that the internal physical senses pertaining to movement, balance,
etc., which are referred to as somesthesia (kinesthetic, vestibular, and
visceral senses), are not added here as additional senses (<em>āyatana</em>).
Although these additional senses are not explained in the scriptures, it
is reasonable that they were excluded because some of their aspects are
included in the fifth sense, referred to as ’body’ (<em>kāya</em>). More
importantly, however, these additional senses function exclusively on a
physiological level, by maintaining a normal physical state of
operation; they have unique attributes and are confined to the inner
life of human beings. Although they are necessary supports, their value
is fixed; they are unable to promote increased benefits in regard to
awareness and experience of the world, to knowledge and understanding,
or to ethics. For this reason, they are not included in the definition
and context of <em>āyatana</em>.</p>

<p>E.g.: Nd. I. 64-5, 105, 162, 169-70, 310-11. The most frequent
grouping of these terms is that of <em>diṭṭhi</em>, <em>khanti</em> and <em>ruci</em>,
e.g.: Vin. I. 69-70; it occurs in many passages of the Mahāniddesa.
These three terms are sometimes accompanied by the terms <em>ajjhāsaya</em>
(’preference’) and <em>adhippāya</em> (’purpose’, ’opinion’), e.g.: Nd. I.
64-5; Nd. II. 43, 50. The largest collection of these synonyms
includes: <em>diṭṭhi</em>, <em>khanti</em>, <em>ruci</em>, <em>ādāya</em> (’accepted belief’),
<em>dhamma-vinaya</em> (’doctrine and discipline’), <em>pāvacana</em> (’fundamental
teaching’), <em>brahmacariya</em> (’supreme teaching’), and <em>satthu-sāsana</em>
(’teaching of the Master’), e.g.: Nd. I. 40, 156; Nd. II. 9, 20;

<p>This concept of the two levels of truth began to take shape as a
clear notion in the Kathāvatthu, although this text does not yet
provide a clear distinction of terms. The term <em>sammati-sacca</em> is
mentioned at Kvu. 311, whereas the terms <em>sacchikattha-paramattha</em>
(’real and absolute’) and <em>paramattha</em> are mentioned at Kvu. 1-69. A
clear description and distinction of these terms occurs at PañcA.
12, 84. They are mentioned in many other sources, e.g.: MA. I. 217 =
SA. II. 13; DhA. III. 403; [Saṅganī Mūlaṭīkā: 165, 280]; [Saṅgaṇī

Paccayaparicchedavaṇṇanā, Paññattibhedavaṇṇanā.[Trans.: In the <em>Dictionary of Buddhism</em>, in the alphabetical list of Pali terms at the end of the book, the venerable author acknowledges both spellings of <em>sammati</em> and <em>sammuti</em> as valid. In the main text of the dictionary, however, he only uses <em>sammati</em>, e.g.: <em>sammati-sacca</em>, <em>sammati-desanā</em>, etc. In his <em>Dictionary of Buddhist Terminology</em> (Thai edition only), he only provides the spelling of <em>sammati</em>. Moreover, in Sir Monier Monier-Williams’s <em>A Sanskrit English Dictionary</em>, only <em>sammati</em> is provided. Although the Pali Text Society’s <em>Pali-English Dictionary</em> greatly favors <em>sammuti</em> (it includes <em>sammata</em> as a past participle), and has no mention of <em>sammati</em>, I decided to go exclusively with <em>sammati</em> in this book.]</p>

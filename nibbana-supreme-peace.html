<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Human beings encounter many trials and tribulations. The situation can
be summed up in one word: suffering (<em>dukkha</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-dukkha">Translations of Dukkha</a>.) Most people freely acknowledge that life,
both on a personal and on a social level, involves facing problems.
These problems affect their happiness and present moral dilemmas. A
close inspection reveals that all of these problems stem from the same
source, that is, by its very nature, human life is endowed with problems
or it has the potential to cause problems.</p>
<p>Saying that the purpose of life is to pursue happiness implies
suffering: the very search for happiness reveals an inner deficiency
that drives people to seek fulfilment. This suffering has many
consequences. The search for happiness gives rise to conflicts of
interest and to social problems. What begins as a personal problem is
magnified and spreads outwards.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Translations of Dukkha</span><a id="note-dukkha"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trans.: there are many English translations for <em>dukkha</em>, including:
’suffering’, ’unsatisfactoriness’, ’stress’, ’pain’, and ’misery’. The
Buddha used this word in different contexts, most notably in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>(a)</em> The Three Characteristics, referring to the stress and
pressure inherent in conditioned phenomena (see Chapter 3);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>(b)</em> the Four Noble Truths, referring to human suffering caused
by ignorance and craving (see chapter 19); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>(c)</em> the three kinds of feeling (<em>vedanā</em>), referring to ’painful
sensation’ (see chapter 1).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The author here is highlighting the overlap and connection between
these meanings, especially (a) and (b).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Yet this description is still rather ambiguous; for the sake of clarity
one needs to get to the heart of the matter. A basic truth of life is
that it is characterized by <em>dukkha</em>; the very nature of human life is
marked by this universal characteristic of <em>dukkha</em>. Human life is a
conditioned phenomenon (<em>saṅkhāra</em>), subject to various causes and
conditions. It is impermanent, unstable, fleeting, and devoid of any
lasting self or substance. One is unable to sustain life or to shape it
purely according to one’s desires; one must conform to causes and
conditions. This is <em>dukkha</em> on a more fundamental level.</p>
<p>The <em>dukkha</em> fundamental to life can be summed up by the words ’aging’
(<em>jarā</em>) and ’death’ (<em>maraṇa</em>), or by the words ’decay’ and
’dissolution’. In the wake of this fundamental <em>dukkha</em> follows <em>dukkha</em>
as a human feeling or emotion, for example: ’suffering’, ’distress’,
’grief’, and ’regret’.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that life is characterized by a basic form of <em>dukkha</em>,
for people to truly solve problems, bring suffering to an end, and
experience real happiness, they must firmly abide in the truth. To begin
with they must come to terms with the fundamental characteristic of
<em>dukkha</em>, by applying wisdom in order to be free from it or to live with
it at ease and to not create problems around it. If one is unable to
reach this state, one should at least gain insight into this fundamental
<em>dukkha</em> and develop a proper mental attitude in regard to it. One thus
acknowledges and faces the truth with understanding.</p>
<p>If people lack this stability and are unable to come to terms with the
fundamental characteristic of <em>dukkha</em>, they allow it to become a hidden
problem lying within. They then try to bury their problems and to turn a
blind eye to suffering. They end up deceiving themselves, and the
problems festering in the mind intensify and increase. {326}</p>
<p>People claim that they desire happiness and are averse to suffering, but
they often create problems for themselves precisely through the means
they use to achieve happiness. Instead of dispelling suffering and
generating happiness, they evade suffering in order to pursue happiness.
They do not attend to the underlying roots of suffering. Their problems
then develop into more serious mental complexes. Instead of dispelling
or reducing suffering, they increase and compound it, both within
themselves and outwards in their conflicts with society.</p>
<p>For those people who attempt to cover over and conceal their suffering,
their pursuit of happiness indicates a sense of lack, distress, anxiety,
and unhappiness. They seek things in order to feel fulfilled or to
dispel their agitation, yet in this search they come into conflict with
others. Moral issues in society thus become intensified.</p>
<p>By attending to suffering incorrectly, people vent their frustrations
outwards, increasing suffering both for themselves and others. As a
consequence, the inherent stress which is part and parcel of the
conditioned nature of life is neglected rather than addressed. With
their singular ingenuity people concoct a whole host of problems, until
the basic predicament of life (of inherent stress) is virtually
forgotten.</p>
<p>People may even delude themselves by thinking that happiness results
from turning a blind eye to suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1-1"><a href="#fn-fn1">1</a></sup> To make matters worse, that
inherent stress, which has been avoided, covertly incites people to
search for and indulge in ever more passionate and restless forms of
pleasure, depriving them of confidence and contentment. As a result,
moral crises in society become more serious, for instance through the
increase of competition and oppression, and suffering is exacerbated.</p>
<p>As long as people are unable to come to terms with this fundamental
aspect of life – unable to reconcile themselves to the universal
characteristic of <em>dukkha</em> – they will not succeed in resolving their
problems. They will not escape the oppression of <em>dukkha</em>, no matter how
much pleasure they experience, and they will not meet with true,
constant happiness, which is intrinsically complete and fully
satisfying.</p>
<p>Human life involves solving problems and seeking release from suffering.
But if we do not know the correct way leading to freedom, our attempted
solutions to these problems only bring about increased suffering. The
greater the effort, the greater the affliction, becoming an ever more
complex cycle: a whirlpool of suffering. This state of affairs is
<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>, the ’wandering around’ or round of rebirth, which the
Buddha explained in the teaching of Dependent Origination
(<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>) under the cycle of origination (<em>samudaya-vāra</em>)
and the forward sequence (<em>anuloma-paṭiccasamuppāda</em>). There it is
revealed how human suffering arises according to cause and effect.</p>
<p>If people are able to face the truth and to understand the true nature
of <em>dukkha</em>, besides being free of mental disorders that create and
compound problems, they will be able to develop wisdom and to free their
minds, even from the fundamental <em>dukkha</em> inherent to life. {327} The
stress and pressure inherent in nature is recognized simply for what it
is. It then has no power to create suffering in the minds of these
individuals.</p>
<p>Even before they have reached complete liberation, those people who are
not deceived or obstructed by unhealthy mental complexes created from
unresolved suffering are able to experience happiness in a full and
satisfactory way. At the same time they have the opportunity to develop
happiness, by accessing ever more refined, independent, spacious,
replete, and pure forms of happiness, until they eventually realize the
happiness that is completely free from suffering. Their pathway to
happiness is unrestricted and limitless.</p>
<p>When the Buddha taught Dependent Origination, he did not end with the
origin of suffering. He also taught the cycle of cessation
(<em>paṭiccasamuppāda-nirodhavāra</em>), which is the process of turning back,
or turning away (<em>vivaṭṭa</em>): the end of suffering. Human suffering can
be remedied and there are ways to achieve this. The Buddha went on to
reveal the supreme state, in which humans are able to live noble lives,
enjoy genuine happiness, and bring true benefit and meaning to life.
They become free, without having to rely on external things or to depend
on the happiness determined by conditioned phenomena.</p>
<p>Conditioned phenomena cannot sustain themselves, let alone sustain our
happiness. Happiness dependent on external things offers no true
support, since it is continually reliant on these things. Seeking
meaning in this insecure form of happiness results in losing freedom and
independence.</p>
<p>Although one may not fully attain the state of ’turning away’ at first,
to the extent that one correctly attends to problems – reducing the
force of the origination cycle and increasing the force of the cessation
cycle – suffering will gradually abate and one’s life will be enhanced.
One will be able to experience the pleasures of the world with wisdom,
not enslaved to them or harmed by their fluctuating currents. Worldly
pleasures will not be a source of trouble to oneself or others, and this
healthy relationship to pleasure will promote wellbeing within society.</p>
<p>The discussion here focuses on the cessation cycle and the end of
suffering, which directly opposes the origination cycle with its
resultant suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn2-1"><a href="#fn-fn2">2</a></sup> {328}</p>
<h2 id="cessation-of-suffering"><a class="header" href="#cessation-of-suffering">Cessation of Suffering</a></h2>
<h3 id="long-format"><a class="header" href="#long-format">Long Format</a></h3>
<p>Before we can solve problems, however large or trivial these problems
may be, we must first understand them accurately. If not, they may
become more complex and severe. To effectively resolve life’s dilemmas
we must understand each dilemma as well as the conditions giving rise to
it. This is especially true when dealing with life’s fundamental
problem: we must know suffering and the causes that bring about
suffering. We must have an understanding of the truth, which is the
essential factor for bringing an end to all suffering. A
misunderstanding of the truth, on the other hand, creates problems. It
results in people’s attempted solutions having an effect counter to the
desired effect and further intensifying suffering.</p>
<p>The origination cycle, i.e. the creation of suffering, begins with
ignorance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>) → volitional activities (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) →
consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>) → mentality and corporeality (<em>nāma-rūpa</em>) →
6 sense bases (<em>saḷāyatana</em>) → contact (<em>phassa</em>) → feeling (<em>vedanā</em>)
→ craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) → clinging (<em>upādāna</em>) → becoming (<em>bhava</em>) →
birth (<em>jāti</em>) → aging and death (<em>jarāmaraṇa</em>), sorrow (<em>soka</em>),
lamentation (<em>parideva</em>), pain (<em>dukkha</em>), grief (<em>domanassa</em>), and
despair (<em>upāyāsa</em>) = origin of suffering (<em>dukkha-samudaya</em>).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reverse form of this is the cessation cycle, which begins with the
extinguishing or absence of ignorance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ignorance ceases → volitional activities cease → consciousness ceases
→ mentality and corporeality cease → 6 sense bases cease → contact
ceases → feeling ceases → craving ceases → clinging ceases → becoming
ceases → birth ceases → aging, death + sorrow … despair cease =
cessation of suffering (<em>dukkha-nirodha</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-cycles">Cycles of Paṭiccasamuppāda</a>)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <em>nirodha</em> (cessation) does not merely mean that something comes
to an end, but also that it cannot reappear or function in the future.
It is prevented from arising; it is stilled or ’detoxified’. The term
<em>paṭiccasamuppāda-nirodhavāra</em> means the ending of existent suffering
and the prevention of further suffering; a process in which suffering
does not arise. The expression ’ignorance ceases’ means both the end of
existing ignorance and the non-arising of future ignorance. It refers to
knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>): to freedom from ignorance. {329}</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Cycles of Paṭiccasamuppāda</span><a id="note-cycles"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, there are four formats for outlining
<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>, both the <em>samudayavāra</em> and the <em>nirodhavāra</em>
cycles:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From beginning to end (the usual format): <em>avijjā</em> → <em>saṅkhāra</em>
→ <em>viññāṇa</em> → <em>nāmarūpa</em> → <em>saḷāyatana</em> → <em>phassa</em> → <em>vedanā</em> →
<em>taṇhā</em> → <em>upādāna</em> → <em>bhava</em> → <em>jāti</em> → <em>jarāmaraṇa + soka …
upāyāsa</em> (e.g. S. II. 1-2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the end to the beginning: <em>jarāmaraṇa (dukkha)</em> ← <em>jāti</em> ←
<em>bhava</em> ← <em>upādāna</em> ← <em>taṇhā</em> ← <em>vedanā</em> ← <em>phassa</em> ←
<em>saḷāyatana</em> ← <em>nāmarūpa</em> ← <em>viññāṇa</em> ← <em>saṅkhāra</em> ← <em>avijjā</em>
(M. I. 261-2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the middle to the beginning: <em>4 ahāra</em> ← <em>taṇhā</em> ← <em>vedanā</em>
← <em>phassa</em> ← <em>saḷāyatana</em> ← <em>nāmarūpa</em> ← <em>viññāṇa</em> ← <em>saṅkhāra</em>
← <em>avijjā</em> (S. II. 11-12).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the middle to the end: (<em>saḷāyatana</em> → <em>phassa</em>) → <em>vedanā</em>
→ <em>(taṇhā)</em> → <em>upādāna</em> → <em>bhava</em> → <em>jāti</em> → <em>jarāmaraṇa + soka
… upāyāsa</em> (M. I. 266).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In the context of <em>nirodhavāra</em>, the long format beginning with the
cessation of ignorance is most commonly used. When explaining
<em>nirodhavāra</em> in the first three formats, the complete sequence is
shown (from or up to <em>avijjā</em>), but in the fourth format a shorter
sequence is presented, as will be discussed soon.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3 id="short-format"><a class="header" href="#short-format">Short Format</a></h3>
<p>Both the origination cycle and cessation cycle shown above are expressed
in the long format, with all twelve constituent factors. Each cycle
proceeds in consecutive order until all factors are complete. However,
these cycles are not always shown in this way, with the entire sequence
of twelve factors. In the Pali Canon there are passages where for
practical application the Buddha presented a process observable in daily
life. The structure of these shortened formats depends on the point at
which a problem begins or on the aspect he wished to emphasize.</p>
<p>The short format of the origination cycle begins with cognition at the
six sense bases (<em>āyatana</em>) and then proceeds as an unbroken chain to
aging, death, sorrow and despair. The initial part of the process, from
ignorance up to the six sense bases, is omitted as its inherent
influence is understood. The short format of the cessation cycle begins
at the cessation of craving – after initial contact and feeling.</p>
<p>Here are two examples from the Pali Canon of the origination cycle
(short format):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, a child grows up and his faculties mature still further; the
youth enjoys himself provided and endowed with the five strands of
sensual pleasure: with forms, sounds, odours, flavours, and tangibles
that are wished for, desired, agreeable and endearing, connected with
sensual desire, and provocative of lust.</p>
<p>On seeing a form with the eye, hearing a sound with the ear, smelling
an odour with the nose, tasting a flavour with the tongue, touching a
tangible with the body, cognizing a mind-object with the mind, he is
fond of it if it is pleasing; he dislikes it if it is displeasing. He
abides with mindfulness of the body unestablished, with an inferior
(undeveloped) mind, and he does not understand as it actually is
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom wherein evil,
unwholesome states cease without remainder. {330}</p>
<p>Engaged as he is in favouring and opposing, whatever feeling he feels,
whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he is
gratified by that feeling, he broods over and welcomes it, and submits
to it. As he does so, delight (nandi; ’infatuation’) arises in him.
Now delight in feelings is clinging. With his clinging as condition,
becoming arises; with becoming as condition, birth; with birth as
condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and
despair come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of
suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn3-1"><a href="#fn-fn3">3</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. I. 266-7.</em></p>
<p>Bhikkhus, what is the origin of suffering? Dependent on the eye and
form, eye-consciousness arises. The union of these three is contact.
With contact as condition, there is feeling. With feeling as
condition, there is craving. This is the origin of suffering. (The
same for the ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.)</p>
<p><em>S. II. 72-3; S. IV. 87.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Selecting the principal elements in the above texts the origination
cycle can be shown as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(Six sense bases → contact →) feeling → delight (nandi) → clinging →
becoming → birth → aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief
and despair = the arising of suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Six sense bases →) contact→ feeling → craving (taṇhā) = the arising
of suffering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These two examples are essentially the same; they both begin with
cognition at the sense bases. The first example presents the process up
to the end. The second example presents the process only up to craving;
the remainder is to be inferred.</p>
<p>Now, two examples of the cessation cycle (short format):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The aforementioned child has studied and practised the Dhamma,
consisting of moral conduct and sense restraint, and developed
concentrative absorption (jhāna): On seeing a form with the eye
… cognizing a mind-object with the mind, he is not fond of it if
it is pleasing; he is not annoyed with it if it is displeasing. He
abides with mindfulness of the body established, with a developed,
immeasurable mind, and he understands as it actually is
deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom wherein those evil,
unwholesome states cease without remainder. Having thus abandoned
favouring and opposing, whatever feeling he feels, whether
pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant, he is not
gratified by that feeling, he does not welcome it or submit to it.
As he does not do so, delight (infatuation) in feelings ceases in
him. With the cessation of his delight comes cessation of
clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of becoming;
with the cessation of becoming, cessation of birth; with the
cessation of birth – aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass
of suffering. {331}</p>
<p><em>M. I. 270.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bhikkhus, what is the passing away of suffering? Dependent on the
eye and form, eye-consciousness arises. The union of these three
is contact. With contact as condition, there is feeling. With
feeling as condition, there is craving. Because that craving
ceases and is extinguished without remainder, clinging ceases.
With the cessation of clinging, becoming ceases. With the
cessation of becoming, birth ceases. With the cessation of birth
– old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair
cease. In this way the entire mass of suffering ceases. This is
the passing away of suffering. (Same for the ear, nose, tongue,
body, and mind.)</p>
<p><em>S. II. 72-3; S. IV. 87.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Based on these two texts the cessation cycle can be depicted as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(6 senses bases → contact →) feeling → delight (nandi) ceases →
clinging ceases → becoming ceases → birth ceases → aging and death,
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and affliction cease = the
cessation of suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(6 senses bases →) contact → feeling → craving (taṇhā); (but)
craving ceases → clinging ceases → becoming ceases → birth ceases →
aging and death, sorrow … affliction cease = the cessation of
suffering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first example presents all components of the short format but in
reversed form to the origination cycle. The second example begins the
same way as example two of the origination cycle, above. But where the
origination cycle ends at craving, here the process changes course and
completes the cycle of cessation. These two examples are essentially the
same; they both demonstrate a severance of the cycle following initial
cognition and feeling. As a result, delight or craving is prevented from
arising and suffering ceases.</p>
<p>Note that the meaning of <em>nandi</em> in the first passage is similar to that
of <em>taṇhā</em> in the second. The meaning differs only slightly, suited to
the context of the first passage. Note also that the expression ’delight
ceases’ in example one indicates clearly that delight does not arise;
there is no delight (infatuation). One can apply this to passage two:
unlike the origination cycle where craving arises subsequent to initial
cognition and feeling, craving is now uprooted; the cycle is broken and
the subsequent factors do not arise. The cessation of suffering is
accomplished.</p>
<p>Although the short formats of <em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em> and <em>vivaṭṭa</em> do not
mention ignorance, the notion of ignorance is integral to both the
origination and cessation cycles. When a feeling is experienced in the
origination cycle, craving arises as a result of not fully comprehending
the truth about the object encountered: that it is impermanent
(<em>anicca</em>), subject to stress (<em>dukkha</em>), and nonself (<em>anattā</em>), and
that it cannot be truly held on to as one’s own. Also, a person does not
know how the object is beneficial or harmful. He cognizes with
ignorance: <em>avijjā-samphassa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn4-1"><a href="#fn-fn4">4</a></sup> The feeling ensuing from such contact
gives rise to craving. {332}</p>
<p>In contrast, when a feeling is experienced in the cycle of cessation,
craving does not arise, because the conditioned nature of the object is
fully understood. With knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>) as a basis, cognition occurs
in a way not influenced by ignorance; contact and feeling then do not
lead to craving. The expression ’craving ceases’ implies the cessation
of ignorance. Here, the short format indirectly points to the cessation
of ignorance by highlighting the cessation of craving. This is analogous
to the Buddha’s concise definition of the second and third noble truths:
craving is the cause of suffering, and the end of suffering occurs with
the end of craving. The Buddha used this way of speaking for practical
reasons, to illustrate the Path and its immediate benefits.</p>
<p>The key feature of cessation, in both the long and short formats, is the
breaking of the sequence. Generally, the sequence is broken at one of
two junctures: the primary break is at ignorance and the secondary break
is at craving. Breaking the cycle is of two types: directly at
ignorance, and indirectly at craving. In either case, the break that is
made must include the elimination of ignorance.</p>
<p>Once the cycle is broken, the round of rebirths (<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>) ends,
the process of turning away (<em>vivaṭṭa</em>) is reached, and freedom from
suffering is attained. A person thus vanquishes all of life’s troubles
and is without sorrow and affliction. He or she has true happiness,
arriving at knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>), liberation (<em>vimutti</em>), purity
(<em>visuddhi</em>), peace (<em>santi</em>), and Nibbāna. This is the highest benefit
that human beings can obtain, making life worthwhile.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-nibbāna"><a class="header" href="#state-of-nibbāna">State of Nibbāna</a></h2>
<p>Etymologically, <em>Nibbāna</em> derives from the prefix <em>ni-</em> (’out’,
’without’, ’finished’, or ’ended’), and <em>vāna</em>, (’to blow’, ’to go’, ’to
move’, or in another sense a ’restraint’). It can be used in relation to
fire or burning, meaning extinguishing, quenching, cooling, or coolness
– but not extinction. In reference to the mind, it means peaceful,
refreshed, and happy: an absence of agitation and anxiety.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn5-1"><a href="#fn-fn5">5</a></sup>
Similarly, it refers to the end of defilements: of greed, hatred and
delusion. The commentaries and subcommentaries usually define Nibbāna as
the end of or escape from craving, which binds people to repeated
existence. (See

</div>
<p>When the round of rebirth (<em>saṁsāravaṭṭa</em>) ends, freedom from rebirth
(<em>vivaṭṭa</em>) takes over immediately and automatically.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn6-1"><a href="#fn-fn6">6</a></sup> One does not
travel from a place of <em>saṁsāravaṭṭa</em> to a place of <em>vivaṭṭa</em>, unless
one is speaking figuratively or comparatively. Ignorance, craving and
clinging cease and Nibbāna appears simultaneously in their place. One
can say that the cessation of ignorance, craving and clinging <em>is</em>
Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Ignorance, craving and clinging disturb the minds of unenlightened
people (<em>puthujjana</em>) and conceal wisdom; they entangle the mind with
defilements (<em>kilesa</em>) and distort vision. When ignorance, craving and
clinging cease, luminous wisdom (<em>vijjā</em>) arises. With such wisdom one
sees all things accurately, not through the lens of one’s desires. A
person’s perception, attitudes and personality change. A new knowledge
and vision arises; things appear that one has never known, seen or
conceived of because they were concealed in the shadows or because one
was preoccupied with other objects. The mind unfolds and expands
immeasurably; it is clear, free, resplendent, peaceful, and profound.
{333} When the state of Nibbāna is reached one knows this for oneself:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Nibbāna is to be seen for oneself,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn7-1"><a href="#fn-fn7">7</a></sup> timeless, inviting one to come
and see, to be brought within and realized, to be experienced
individually by the wise.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn8-1"><a href="#fn-fn8">8</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. I. 158-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Ordinary people are unable to comprehend or imagine the state of
Nibbāna. When encountering new concepts people normally use previous
knowledge as a basis for comparison, and in attempting to understand
Nibbāna they create an image that is a composite of pre-existing
perceptions.</p>
<p>Take for example a person who has never heard of an elephant. On hearing
the word ’elephant’ he may think it is a foreign word or simply
nonsense. Learning that an elephant is an animal, he may consider all
animals, from ants to whales, irrespective of size or type. The image is
clearer when he is told that an elephant is an enormous land animal with
big ears, small eyes, tusks, and a trunk.</p>
<p>This image may be close to reality or far from it; if he were to draw a
picture on paper of what he sees in his mind, it may resemble some
bizarre, mythological beast. Having never seen the real thing, he uses
familiar perceptions to create an elaborate new image. The image will
depend both on the accuracy of the speaker’s descriptions of the object,
and on the listener’s stored perceptions used as components for a new
perception.</p>
<p>In the case of something utterly different from anything previously
perceived, and thoroughly incomparable, the listener has no way to
conceive of it. If he attempts to understand this thing by means of
familiar concepts and perceptions, the only reasonable way for the
speaker to respond is by negation. Further speculation by the listener,
using stored perceptions for comparison, can easily lead to
misunderstanding. He may even go so far as outright rejection, accusing
the speaker of deception and claiming that the thing in question does
not exist. {334} Such rejection, based on unfamiliarity and an inability
to conceive of something, would be ungrounded.</p>
<p>Nibbāna is beyond everything known by ordinary people – beyond their
sphere and range – surpassing cognition influenced by ignorance,
craving and clinging. It is a state arrived at directly with the
abandonment of defilements, like sliding back a screen and seeing the
sky. Nibbāna has no properties similar to things known by ordinary
people. But claiming Nibbāna does not exist is incorrect.</p>
<p>The following fable has been used to illustrate how the unknown is not
necessarily the unreal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A fish and a turtle were close friends. The fish had spent its entire
life in a lake, whereas the amphibious turtle knew both land and lake.
One day the turtle returned to the lake after a walk on land. He told
the fish how refreshing it was to walk on land, among open fields and
a pleasant breeze. The fish listened for a while perplexed and
thought: ’What is walking?’ ’What is dry land?’ ’How can there be
happiness without water? Certainly, it just spells death.’</em></p>
<p>The fish grew impatient and interrupted the turtle, seeking
clarification. The turtle explained using earth terms; when the fish
inquired with water terms, the turtle could only reject them. The
turtle could not find any suitable comparisons and the fish thus
concluded that the turtle was lying, that the story wasn’t true: dry
land does not exist and nor do fields, pleasant breezes or happiness
outside of water. The turtle spoke of something that does exist but it
lay beyond the fish’s ken. Since the fish had never been on land it
was unable to understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider the distinct experience and perception arising from each of the
senses. Sense impressions differ absolutely from each other and are not
comparable: sights cannot be compared with sounds, nor can sounds with
smells. A person blind from birth cannot understand the nature of green,
red, orange, pink, or other characteristics of sight, using perceptual
knowledge from other sense bases. Words such as ’loud’, ’faint’,
’malodorous’, ’fragrant’, ’sour’ or ’sweet’ would all be inadequate. No
one can accurately explain to a person born without the sense of smell
the quality of fetid, fragrant, the smell of roses, citrus or jasmine.
Words such as ’red’, ’blue’, ’heavy’, ’light’, ’fat’, ’thin’, ’bitter’
and ’salty’ would all be unsuitable. Human beings have five sense organs
for cognizing the world’s properties, the sense objects (<em>ārammaṇa</em>).
Knowledge surpassing the domain of mundane objects generally remains
hidden. Even the five recognized sense objects are known according to
disparate qualities. Lack of familiarity or an inability to conceive of
something is therefore not a guarantee of its non-existence.</p>
<p>Soon after the Buddha’s enlightenment, before proclaiming the Dhamma, he
had this thought:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The Dhamma<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn9-1"><a href="#fn-fn9">9</a></sup> that I have attained is profound, difficult to see,
difficult to realize, peaceful, excellent, not accessible by
reasoning,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn10-1"><a href="#fn-fn10">10</a></sup> subtle, to be known by the wise. {335}</p>
<p>This is followed by the verse: I should not now teach what I have
attained with such tribulation; this Dhamma cannot be easily realized
by those overcome with greed and hatred. Beings dyed in lust,
enveloped in darkness (ignorance), will not discern that which goes
against the current, is subtle, profound, difficult to see, refined.</p>
<p><em>Vin. I. 5; M. I. 168.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Despite its complexity the Buddha did make great effort to teach and
explain the Dhamma. However, Nibbāna cannot be penetrated by mere
thought. No words or perceptions exist to accurately describe or define
it. Conceptualizing and disputing the subject of Nibbāna only leads to
misunderstanding. The correct way is to apply the teachings so as to
arrive at Nibbāna and see it clearly for oneself. With proper
determination, rather than being ’inconceivable’ or ’indescribable’,
Nibbāna is merely ’difficult to see, difficult to realize’, as quoted by
the Buddha above.</p>
<p>It is worth noting the expressions the Buddha used when he spoke about
Nibbāna. The definitions of Nibbāna can be summarised in the following
four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>By negation</strong>: those expressions marking the renunciation and
removal of some inferior, unlovely or disadvantageous condition
belonging to the round of rebirth (<em>vaṭṭa</em>). For example: <em>Nibbāna
is the end of greed, hatred and delusion;</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn11-1"><a href="#fn-fn11">11</a></sup> <em>Nibbāna is the
cessation of becoming;</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn12-1"><a href="#fn-fn12">12</a></sup> <em>Nibbāna is the end of craving;</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn13-1"><a href="#fn-fn13">13</a></sup>
and, <em>the end of suffering</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn14-1"><a href="#fn-fn14">14</a></sup> Such descriptions also use terms
revealing a quality directly opposite to an attribute of <em>vaṭṭa</em>.
For example, Nibbāna is unconditioned (<em>asaṅkhata</em>), ageless
(<em>ajara</em>), and deathless (<em>amata</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By synonym</strong>: those terms indicating completion or perfection. For
example: <em>santa</em> (’peaceful’), <em>paṇīta</em> (’excellent’), <em>suddhi</em>
(’pure’), and <em>khema</em> (’secure’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn15-1"><a href="#fn-fn15">15</a></sup> {336}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By simile and metaphor</strong>: similes are more often used for
explaining the state and traits of a person who has attained Nibbāna
than for Nibbāna itself. For example, the comparison of an arahant
to a bull, leading his herd across the river to arrive at the other
side,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn16-1"><a href="#fn-fn16">16</a></sup> or to a person crossing a great ocean filled with dangers
and reaching the shore.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn17-1"><a href="#fn-fn17">17</a></sup> The Buddha claimed that it is
inaccurate to say an arahant is reborn (’reappears’) somewhere, or
is not born; he compared an arahant to a fire that is extinguished
because there is no more fuel.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn18-1"><a href="#fn-fn18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>There are some direct similes, for example: Nibbāna is like a
tranquil, pleasant region;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn19-1"><a href="#fn-fn19">19</a></sup> like the other shore, secure and
free from danger;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn20-1"><a href="#fn-fn20">20</a></sup> and like a message of truth.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn21-1"><a href="#fn-fn21">21</a></sup> There are
many metaphors, for example: <em>ārogya</em> (without illness; perfect
health), <em>dīpa</em> (an island; freedom from danger), and <em>leṇa</em> (a
cave; shelter from danger). In later scriptures composed by
disciples there are metaphors referring to Nibbāna as a city, e.g.
<em>puramuttamaṁ</em> (’magnificent city’)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn22-1"><a href="#fn-fn22">22</a></sup> and <em>nibbāna-nagara</em>
(’fortress of Nibbāna’)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn23-1"><a href="#fn-fn23">23</a></sup> used as oratorical and literary terms.
Thai idioms include ’great deathless citadel’
(<em>amatamahānagara-nirvāna</em>), and ’crystal city’, but these later
words are not recognized as accurate terms revealing the true state
of Nibbāna.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>By direct explanation</strong>: these explanations occur in only a few
places, but they are of much interest to scholars, especially for
those who consider Buddhism a philosophy. The varying
interpretations have given rise to numerous debates. I have
presented a selection below.</p>
</li>

<p>There are many more references and descriptions for Nibbāna in the
scriptures containing verses by disciples and in the commentaries (e.g.
Niddesa, Paṭisambhidāmagga, Theragāthā, Therīgāthā, Apadāna), as well as
in later scriptures, (e.g. Abhidhānappadīpikā). Examples are listed
below:</p>

<p>Some of these terms are very important, since they are repeatedly used
as definitions for Nibbāna, for example: <em>asaṅkhata</em>, <em>nirodha</em>,
<em>vimutti</em>, <em>virāga</em>, <em>santa</em> and <em>santi</em>. Other words are used
infrequently. Some are used in only one location, others in two or three
locations, so they should not be regarded as highly significant. They
are included here to increase understanding. The same is true for the
translations; they provide some sense of the meaning, but they might not
give a complete flavour as they lack the supportive context.</p>
<p>And very important, many terms were familiar to people in the specific
time period, region, and community in which the Buddha taught, and the
terms were associated with their personal values or religious beliefs.
When the words were spoken, the listeners probably understood the
meaning completely. Sometimes the Buddha used descriptive words for
Nibbāna to facilitate communication while substituting a new meaning in
accord with Buddha-Dhamma. People outside of those time periods, places,
and groups may not completely understand the meaning of these words.</p>
<p>An important word for describing Nibbāna is <em>asaṅkhata</em> (’not
constructed’). Nibbāna does not exist as a result of causes or
conditions. It may be claimed that Nibbāna must arise from causes, since
Nibbāna is the fruit of <em>magga</em> (the Path, the Way) or of practice in
accordance with the Way. This doubt can be answered briefly by way of
analogy: if we compare practice for reaching Nibbāna with travelling to
the city of Chiang Mai, we see that Chiang Mai, which is the goal of the
journey, is not the result of the path or the act of travelling.
Regardless of the road or of travelling, Chiang Mai exists. The road and
travelling are causes for reaching Chiang Mai, but not for Chiang Mai
itself. It is the same with the Path and practice along the Path, which
are causes for attaining Nibbāna, but not for Nibbāna itself.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn26-1"><a href="#fn-fn26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Apart from <em>vimutti</em>, there are many other synonyms that reveal facets
of Nibbāna, as presented earlier. Of all these synonyms, there are two
often-used words that represent important properties: <em>visuddhi</em> and
<em>santi</em>. <em>Visuddhi</em> is purity or cleanness, the absence of defilements,
which tarnish and obscure, and refers to the ability to see things
clearly. <em>Santi</em> is peace, the absence of agitation and affliction, the
end of turmoil; this state of mind is serene, deep, cool, settled,
self-reliant, able to fully experience the fruits of practice, and ready
to be employed for action.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn27-1"><a href="#fn-fn27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>The few passages that explain the state of Nibbāna explicitly are
presented below. In some cases a story is provided in order to give the
context for the Buddha’s words:</p>
<p>At one time the Buddha gave a Dhamma discourse to the bhikkhus
concerning Nibbāna. As the bhikkhus were listening intently, the Buddha
uttered this exclamation:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there exists that sphere (<em>āyatana</em>) where there is neither the
earth, water, fire, or air elements; nor the realm of infinite space;
nor the realm of infinite consciousness; nor the realm of nothingness;
nor the realm of neither perception nor non-perception; nor this
world; nor the next world; nor the moon; nor the sun. I do not say
that that sphere has going, coming, arising, staying, or passing away.
It has neither foundation, nor movement, nor constraint (<em>ārammaṇa</em>).
That is the end of suffering.</p>
<p><em>Ud. 80-81.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>On another occasion, the Buddha gave a similar teaching to the bhikkhus,
and uttered this verse:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, <em>anata</em> (the state of not inclining towards birth; being without
craving, i.e. Nibbāna) is difficult to see. Truth (<em>sacca</em>) is not
easily discerned. Having penetrated craving, and by knowing and seeing
[the truth], there will be nothing lingering in the mind (nothing to
cause mental anxiety).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn28-1"><a href="#fn-fn28">28</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>On a similar occasion:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there is the Not-born (<em>ajāta</em>), Not-become (<em>abhūta</em>), Not-made
(<em>akata</em>), Not-constructed (<em>asaṅkhata</em>). If there were not the Not-born,
Not-become, Not-made, Not-constructed, then there could not be known
the escape here from the born, the become, the made and the
constructed. But because there is the Not-born, Not-become, Not-made,
Not-constructed, therefore the escape here can be known from the born,
become, made and constructed.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn29-1"><a href="#fn-fn29">29</a></sup> {339}</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>On a similar occasion:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Still being dependent, there is wavering. Not being dependent, there
is no wavering. There being no wavering, there is tranquillity. With
tranquillity, there is no favouring. With no favouring, no coming and
going. With no coming and going, no passing away and arising. With no
passing away and arising, there is neither this world, the other
world, nor a between-the-two. This is the end of suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn30-1"><a href="#fn-fn30">30</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Another account describes the Buddha correcting the view of Brahma. In
brief, at one time this pernicious view arose in the Brahma named Baka:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>This abode of Brahma is permanent, enduring and eternal. It is
absolute and imperishable. This abode of Brahma is not born; it does
not originate, age, die, or pass away. A superior salvation cannot be
found.</p>
<p>The Buddha, knowing Baka’s thought, went to him and said: Brahma, you
have lapsed into ignorance. Therefore, you claim that which is
impermanent as permanent, unstable as enduring, and uneternal as
eternal … and there being a superior salvation, you claim there is
none.</p>
<p>Then Māra possessed one of Brahma’s retinue, who spoke to the Buddha:
Bhikkhu, bhikkhu, do not offend Brahma, do not offend Brahma. This is
Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Lord (<em>abhibhū</em>), the Unvanquished, The
All Seeing One, the Omnipotent, the Sovereign, the Maker, the Creator,
Excellence, Providence, the Master, Father of those born and to be
born….</p>
<p>The Buddha admonished Māra, finishing with: Brahma and all his company
and retinue are in your hands, are in your power … but I have not
fallen into your hands, nor am I under your power.</p>
<p>When Baka maintained: I have declared the permanent as permanent, the
enduring as enduring, the eternal as eternal … the Buddha announced
that there are many things that Brahma does not know, including:</p>
<p>The state that can be known (<em>viññāṇa</em>), not seen with the eyes
(<em>anidassana</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn31-1"><a href="#fn-fn31">31</a></sup> limitless (<em>ananta</em>), and all radiant
(<em>sabbato-pabhā</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn32-1"><a href="#fn-fn32">32</a></sup> which the solidity of earth cannot hold, the
wetness of water … the heat of fire … the movement of wind cannot
hold, the existence of beings … the divinity of devas … the rule
of Pajāpati … the grandeur of Brahma … the brilliance of the
Ābhassara Brahmas … the beauty of the Subhakiṇha Brahmas … the
abundance of the Vehapphala Brahmas cannot hold, the lordship of the
Lord cannot hold, the characteristics of all things cannot hold. {340}</p>
<p>Baka replied to this by saying that he would vanish from sight, but he
was unable to do so. The Buddha in turn said he would vanish and did
vanish. Brahma and his retinue could only hear his voice speaking:
Having seen the danger in being, and seen the existence of those who
seek non-being (<em>vibhava</em>), I do not praise any sort of being, nor cling
to delight (i.e. <em>bhava-taṇhā</em>: the craving for being).</p>
<p><em>M. I. 327-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Another story tells of a bhikkhu who travelled through every realm until
he reached the Brahma world, seeking an answer to a question:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>This bhikkhu had the following doubt: Where are the four great
elements – earth, water, fire and air – extinguished without
remainder? He then entered a state of concentration and visited the
various deities, beginning with the realm of the Four Great Kings, to
pose his question. Unable to answer him, the gods suggested he go to
progressively higher heaven realms until he arrived at the Brahma
world. The Brahmas too could not answer but said that the Great
Brahma, the Lord, would surely know. With a splendid radiance the
Great Brahma revealed himself to that bhikkhu.</p>
<p>The bhikkhu posed his question to the Great Brahma, who prevaricated:
I am Brahma, Great Brahma, the Lord, the Unvanquished, the All Seeing
One, the Omnipotent, the Sovereign, the Maker, the Creator,
Excellence, Providence, the Master, Father of those born and to be
born.</p>
<p>The bhikkhu continued: I did not ask you if you are Brahma, Great
Brahma, the Lord…. I asked you where the four great elements are
extinguished without remainder.</p>
<p>Brahma replied again, that he is Great Brahma, the Lord, etc.</p>
<p>The bhikkhu asked again, for a third time, at which point Brahma took
him by the arm and led him to one side, saying: Monk, these gods,
followers of Brahma, recognize me as one for whom there is nothing not
known, seen, experienced, or realized. Therefore, I did not answer in
front of them. Monk, I also do not know where the four great elements
are extinguished without remainder. It is thus your misdeed and
mistake that you have abandoned the Blessed One, and come to search
for an answer to this problem elsewhere. Go and approach the Blessed
One to pose this question and accept whatever answer he gives.</p>
<p>The bhikkhu then went to ask the Buddha, who answered: You should not
ask: ’Where are the four great elements – earth, water, fire and air
– extinguished without remainder?’ You should ask: ’Where can earth,
water, fire and air find no footing? Where can long and short, small
and large, beautiful and repulsive find no firm ground? Where do
mentality and corporeality terminate without remainder?’ He then
explained as follows: {341}</p>
<p>The state that can be known (<em>viññāṇa</em>), is not seen with the eyes
(<em>anidassana</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn33-1"><a href="#fn-fn33">33</a></sup> is limitless (<em>ananta</em>), and can be reached from
every direction (<em>sabbatopabhā</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn34-1"><a href="#fn-fn34">34</a></sup> – here, earth, water, fire and
air can find no footing; long and short, fine and coarse, beautiful
and repulsive can find no firm ground; mentality and corporeality
terminate without remainder. Because sense consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>)
ceases, mentality and corporeality terminate here.</p>
<p><em>D. I. 215-23.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These descriptions of Nibbāna have resulted in various interpretations
and debates. Some scholars interpret the last two passages as a Buddhist
attempt to combat Brahmanism by assimilation, by incorporating the
Brahmanic personification of God. Note that in all these passages the
Buddha was either teaching bhikkhus, who had a basic knowledge of
Dhamma, or was speaking to Brahma, who is a master theoretician. I will
not elaborate upon these details here, but remember that this disparity
of interpretation arises because Nibbāna cannot be conceived of; it must
be known directly through spiritual practice.</p>
<p>Pali words are sometimes translated differently. The word <em>āyatana</em> in
the first passage, for example, can be translated as ’sphere’, and some
interpret this to mean a dwelling or place. Others interpret <em>āyatana</em>
as another dimension. The term <em>viññāṇa</em>, in passages five and six, is
considered by some to be identical with <em>viññāṇa</em> in the expressions
eye-<em>viññāṇa</em>, ear-<em>viññāṇa</em>, etc. They thus interpret Nibbāna as some
form of consciousness, defining Nibbāna as a consciousness that is not
seen with the eyes, etc.</p>
<p>In the commentaries, however, <em>viññāṇa</em> is explained in this passage to
be a name for Nibbāna – ’the state that can be known’ – as used
above.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn35-1"><a href="#fn-fn35">35</a></sup> We can see that in passage six the word <em>viññāṇa</em> occurs
twice. The first <em>viññāṇa</em> refers to Nibbāna, with its own distinct
translation (’the state that can be known’), while the latter <em>viññāṇa</em>,
in the phrase ’<em>viññāṇa</em> ceases’, refers to the consciousness that is
the condition for the arising of mentality and corporeality, as
explained in Dependent Origination.</p>
<p>We should refrain from drawing conclusions about Nibbāna simply because
an interpretation accords with our preferences and preconceptions. If we
establish firm convictions about something we do not yet clearly know,
we may be greatly deceived. Rather, we should emphasize those methods
leading to Nibbāna, along with the benefits of gradual liberation. This
is more practical. As our spiritual practice develops, we will clearly
see the results for ourselves. {342}</p>
<p>The following quote is an affirmation by the Buddha that the realization
of Nibbāna, and other sublime states, can truly occur, when the ’eye’ of
wisdom opens. This is the Buddha’s conversation with the brahmin student
Subha. The Buddha refutes the brahmin Pokkharasāti’s assertion that it
is impossible for humans to experience superlative knowledge and vision
(<em>ñāṇadassana</em>):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’Young man, suppose there were a person blind from birth who could not
see black forms, white forms, green, yellow, red or pink forms. He
could not see even and uneven forms, the stars, the moon or the sun.
Were he to say that black and white forms do not exist, and beholders
of black and white forms do not exist; that green forms do not exist,
and beholders of green forms do not exist … that the moon and sun do
not exist, and beholders of the moon and sun do not exist; were he to
say ’I do not know or see those things, therefore they do not exist’;
would he be speaking correctly?’</p>
<p>’Incorrectly,’ the young man replied.</p>
<p>The Buddha then continued: ’Just so, the brahmin Pokkharasāti of the
Opamañña clan, lord of the Subhaga Grove, is blind and visionless.
That he could know, see or realize outstanding knowledge and vision,
which is competent, excellent and superhuman, is impossible.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn36-1"><a href="#fn-fn36">36</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. II. 201-202.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Although we may have considered these explanations of Nibbāna, if we
have not practised and arrived at this state, we should remember that
all ideas of Nibbāna are comparable to the images the blind men formed
after touching the elephant. The story from the Pali, in brief, is as
follows:</p>
<p>At one time in the city of Sāvatthī, a large number of religious
ascetics, wanderers, and brahmins, of various creeds, adhered to their
own beliefs and doctrines as the only truth, while repudiating those of
others. This gave rise to quarrelling: ’The truth is this way, not that
way; the truth is not that way, it is this way.’ In response the Buddha
told the following story:</p>
<p>In former times a king of Sāvatthī ordered his advisors to gather all
those men in the city who were blind from birth and present them with an
elephant. The advisors showed one group of blind men the elephant’s
head; to another they showed the elephant’s ear. They showed the tusks
to another group, the trunk, the abdomen, the legs, the back, the tail,
the tip of the tail, to each respective group, saying each time that
this is an elephant. They then informed the king that the blind men had
become familiar with the elephant. {343} The king went to the gathering
of the blind and asked them, ’Have you seen the elephant?’ They replied,
’We have, Your Majesty.’ The king inquired further: ’As you say you have
seen an elephant, describe it to me.’</p>
<p>Those blind men who had touched the head said that an elephant is like a
waterpot. Those who had felt the ears said an elephant is like a
winnowing basket. Those who had touched the tusks – a ploughshare.
Those who had touched the trunk – a plough shaft. Those who had touched
the abdomen said an elephant is like a granary. Those who had touched
the legs, claimed it is like a pillar. Those who touched the back – a
mortar. Those who touched the tail – a pestle. Those who touched the
tip of the tail said an elephant is like a broom. When this was
finished, the blind men began to argue: ’An elephant is this way, not
that way; an elephant is not that way, it is this way’, to the point of
brawling.</p>
<p>At the end the Buddha uttered this verse:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Indeed, some ascetics and brahmins<br />
cling to such views and doctrines;<br />
people who see only one part,<br />
being contentious, argue and quarrel.</em></p>
<p><em>Ud. 67-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h2 id="elements-of-nibbāna"><a class="header" href="#elements-of-nibbāna">Elements of Nibbāna</a></h2>
<p>The discussion so far has focused on Nibbāna as an absolute and
transcendent quality. It is possible, however, to distinguish different
kinds of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Essentially, only one Nibbāna exists; it is divided into categories in
order to describe the characteristics of persons in contact with
Nibbāna, or to describe various properties of Nibbāna itself.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn37-1"><a href="#fn-fn37">37</a></sup> A
widely known division of Nibbāna from the Itivuttaka is into the two
’elements of Nibbāna’ (<em>nibbāna-dhātu</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn38-1"><a href="#fn-fn38">38</a></sup> {386}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sa-upādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>: Nibbāna with remaining <em>upādi</em>
(’fuel’).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>: Nibbāna with no remaining ’fuel’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The commentaries define the distinguishing factor here – <em>upādi</em> – as
the five aggregates (<em>pañca-khandha</em>), in the sense that they are
governed by impure actions or are subject to grasping.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn39-1"><a href="#fn-fn39">39</a></sup> The
definitions of these terms based on this interpretation are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sa-upādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>: Nibbāna linked with the five
aggregates, or Nibbāna with the five aggregates still remaining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>: Nibbāna free from the five
aggregates.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn40-1"><a href="#fn-fn40">40</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the passage where these two terms appear in the Itivuttaka:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>This was said by the Blessed and Fully Enlightened One, so I have
heard: ’Bhikkhus, there are these two elements of Nibbāna, namely,
Nibbāna with fuel remaining and Nibbāna with no fuel remaining.</p>
<p>And what is the Nibbāna with fuel remaining? Bhikkhus, there is the
case of a monk who is an arahant with taints destroyed, who has lived
the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, reached
the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is completely
liberated through final knowledge. His five sense faculties still
remain, and owing to their being intact, he experiences the agreeable
and the disagreeable, he feels both pleasure and pain. His ending of
lust, hatred and delusion is termed the Nibbāna with fuel remaining.</p>
<p>And what is the Nibbāna with no fuel remaining? There is the case of
an arahant with taints destroyed … who is completely liberated
through final knowledge. For him, all that is felt (vedayita), not
being delighted in (anabhinandita; ’not being infatuated with’), will
become cool right here. This is termed Nibbāna with no fuel remaining.
{387}</p>
<blockquote>
<p>**</p>
<p>The One with Vision, secure and free,<br />
Has proclaimed the dual elements of Nibbāna.<br />
One element, present and visible (<em>diṭṭhadhammika</em>),<br />
Is called Nibbāna with fuel remaining;<br />
Exhausted are the taints,<br />
Conduits to renewed existence.<br />
The other, the supreme state,<br />
Is Nibbāna with no remaining fuel;<br />
In which all becoming totally ceases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It. 38-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This passage introducing the two elements describes the quality of
association with Nibbāna, that is, it describes Nibbāna in connection to
enlightened beings. It uses enlightened beings as a means to understand
Nibbāna; it does not attempt to explain Nibbāna in an absolute sense.
This is because Nibbāna is <em>sandiṭṭhika</em>, ’to be seen for oneself’, and
is <em>paccattaṁ veditabbaṁ viññūhi</em>, ’to be experienced individually by
the wise’, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, this division of Nibbāna
does not introduce anything different or mysterious into the earlier
examination of the nature of Nibbāna. As the commentators say, Nibbāna
is essentially indivisible; the division is a didactic tool.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn41-1"><a href="#fn-fn41">41</a></sup> Before
looking more closely at the two kinds of Nibbāna, let us familiarize
ourselves with three important terms:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Vedayita</em>: this term stems from the same root as <em>vedanā</em>, and in
some cases it is used as a substitute for <em>vedanā</em>. It refers to
’sense experience’ or to ’sense impressions’. Here, the plural is
<em>vedayitāni</em>, which refers to all objects that have been sensed or
cognized. It is equivalent to what people nowadays refer to as their
whole range of ’experience’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anabhinandita</em>: this term, used above as a qualifying adjective for
<em>vedayita</em>, is derived from <em>abhinandita</em>, which means ’pleasing’ or
’delightful’. In this context <em>abhinandita</em> implies infatuation and
a heart adulterated by craving, and it applies to both positive and
negative experiences, to delight and aversion. Adding the negating
prefix <em>an-</em>, the meaning becomes ’not infatuated’; in this case,
craving does not accompany sense impressions. Sense experience
occurs in a pure, spacious, and unobstructed way, free from fretting
and brooding. One does not distort or deviate from direct sense
experience, because the mind is not controlled or overwhelmed by
greed, hatred and delusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhadhammika</em>: literally, this word means ’visible’ or ’visible
object’. In reference to time, it means ’in the present’ or ’in this
life’. In reference to objects or mental states, it means ’common’,
’mundane’, ’basic’, ’material’, or ’exterior’. It is generally
paired with <em>samparāyika</em>, which literally means ’further’ or
’beyond’. In relation to time it means ’future’, ’later’, ’beyond
this life’, or ’in the next world’. In other contexts, it means
’transcendent’, ’supreme’, ’sacred’, ’spiritual’, or
’internal’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn42-1"><a href="#fn-fn42">42</a></sup> {388}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, let us look more closely at the two kinds of Nibbāna:</p>
<p><em>Sa-upādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em> refers to Nibbāna connected to the five
aggregates. It is the Nibbāna of arahants as they cognize sense objects,
pleasurable and painful, through the senses. Cognition is inextricably
linked with the five aggregates; the five aggregates are directly
involved in sense experience and the aggregates themselves become
further objects of cognition.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn43-1"><a href="#fn-fn43">43</a></sup> This aspect of Nibbāna highlights
arahants’ contact with the world. It focuses on the end of greed, hatred
and delusion,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn44-1"><a href="#fn-fn44">44</a></sup> which leads to an unobstructed experience of life.
<em>Sa-upādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em> is the arahant’s liberated state of mind,
free from defilements. Arahants are not influenced by defilements and
therefore sense contact does not give rise to craving, either as
coveting or aversion. Additionally, no craving exists that leads to
renewed existence (<em>bhava-netti</em>). An arahant with unimpaired sense
faculties is thus able to receive sense impressions freely and with
wisdom.</p>
<p>This free state of mind has two facets. The first is the ability to
receive sense impressions as pure ’feeling’ (<em>vedanā</em>), since there are
no residual attachments or obsessions to interfere. The second is not
being overwhelmed by experience, and thus one does not form future
habits of attachment or infatuation. For arahants this is the ordinary,
usual state of mind. It is immediate and accessible in every moment of
sense contact. Therefore, it is called <em>diṭṭha-dhamma</em>: visible or
immediate. This type of Nibbāna is the state of arahants while they are
still alive and in contact with the external world.</p>
<p><em>Anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em> is the Nibbāna independent of the five
aggregates. It is the Nibbāna beyond the process of experiencing
phenomena through the five senses, or over and above the five aggregates
engaged in cognition. It is the Nibbāna transcending mundane reality,
transcending sense contact and experience.</p>
<p>In other words, <em>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em> is the essential nature of
Nibbāna which is revealed to arahants when experience by way of the five
senses ceases, when cognition ceases, or when there is no involvement
with sense contact (including input from the five senses still remaining
in the mind).</p>
<p>An arahant receives sense impressions without craving-induced delight
(<em>abhinandita</em>), without the inflaming influence of greed, hatred and
delusion. {389} Sense impressions do not linger and smoulder; they
’become cool’ (<em>sīti-bhavissanti</em>); they become completely peaceful and
’detoxified’. And they are unable to lead to further birth or becoming.
Arahants are capable of neutralizing any obstructive potential of sense
experience, ’cooling’ and mastering it. They therefore acquire the
epithet <em>sīti-bhūta</em> or <em>sīta</em>, meaning ’one who is cooled’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn45-1"><a href="#fn-fn45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>This state of clarity, absent of residual sense experience, is internal
and personal. It is the state of ’non-becoming’ or of no renewed
existence. In this state where the five aggregates are no longer objects
of awareness, arahants thus have Nibbāna as their object; they realize
Nibbāna as a <em>dhammāyatana</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn46-1"><a href="#fn-fn46">46</a></sup> This quality can only be discussed in
its relational context, by saying that ordinary mundane experience
ceases. The essential absolute nature of Nibbāna can only be seen and
realized for oneself.</p>
<p>An analogy for this division of Nibbāna is to being shipwrecked in the
ocean. An unenlightened person is swimming, struggling against the waves
and currents. A person who has realized Nibbāna has reached dry land.
The arrival at land, where one is perfectly satisfied and at ease, is
like <em>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>. The absence of oppression and danger,
not being battered by the waves, being able to engage with things
freely, and being able to move about as one wishes, is like
<em>sa-upādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>.</p>
<p>One can also compare an unenlightened person to someone suffering a
fever. An enlightened person is someone who has recovered from fever or
is in perfect health. {390} Good health is inherently complete; when one
is healthy one knows this state for oneself. The contentment, joy, ease
and relief is purely subjective. Others observing from outside may
conjecture on that state, but they are unable to experience it directly.
This state of wellbeing is like <em>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>. The related
condition, which affects behaviour and influences a person’s
surroundings, that is, of not being oppressed or impeded by illness, and
being able to act as one wishes, is like <em>sa-upādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>.</p>
<p>To summarize, there is only one Nibbāna, but with two aspects. One
aspect (<em>sa-upādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>) focuses on the end of defilements,
which has a bearing on the relationship to the outside world or on
everyday life. The second (<em>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>) is limited to
Nibbāna’s essential nature, which is realized solely by enlightened
beings. It cannot be fathomed by way of the five senses, and is beyond
experience confined to the five aggregates. In other words, in
<em>sa-upādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em> arahants have the five aggregates as the
object of attention; in <em>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em> arahants have Nibbāna
as the object of attention.</p>
<p>To say <em>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em> is Nibbāna’s essential nature is
compatible with the commentarial opinion found in the Paramatthadīpanī,
which describes <em>amatamahānibbāna-dhātu</em> (’deathless Nibbāna element’)
as <em>anupādisesā</em> (’with no remaining fuel’). It is also consistent with
the Buddha’s words: ’Monks, there exists that sphere (<em>āyatana</em>), where
there is neither the earth, water, fire, or air elements; nor the realm
of infinite space….’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn47-1"><a href="#fn-fn47">47</a></sup> Elsewhere, the commentaries and
sub-commentaries point out that <em>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em> is identical
to <em>anupādā-parinibbāna</em> (’final, absolute Nibbāna’),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn48-1"><a href="#fn-fn48">48</a></sup> which is the
goal of Dhamma practice and comprises the highest realization in
Buddhism. {391}</p>
<p>In most cases, cognition by way of the five senses and contact with the
external world clearly and decisively ends at death.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn49-1"><a href="#fn-fn49">49</a></sup> With the utter
end of sense contact at death, arahants realize the indivisible aspect
of Nibbāna, i.e. <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em>. Colloquially, the term
<em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em> is used as an expression for the death of an
arahant. From a word denoting quality, <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em> came to
refer to an action or event. Where this word is found elsewhere in the
scriptures, it refers to the death of the Buddha or of the arahants.</p>
<p>As for the term <em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em>, in the Tipiṭaka it is not used
to describe an event and is found only in this one passage of the
Itivuttaka. There are synonyms of <em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em> that are used
frequently.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn50-1"><a href="#fn-fn50">50</a></sup></p>
<p>There are many passages in the Tipiṭaka where the term
<em>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em> is used alone. For example, in the Buddha’s
comparison of the Dhammavinaya to the marvels of the ocean:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Just as in the great ocean neither a decrease nor an increase will
appear though rain falls into it from the sky; even so, even if many
monks attain final Nibbāna in the Nibbāna element that is without
remainder, there is no decrease or increase in the Nibbāna element
that is without remainder.</p>
<p><em>Vin. II. 239-40; A. IV. 202-203; Ud. 55.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Mahāniddesa refers to <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em> as
<em>anabhinibbatti-sāmaggī</em>, meaning ’fully prepared to not be
reborn’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn51-1"><a href="#fn-fn51">51</a></sup></p>
<p>The accounts in the Pali Canon of the Buddha’s life frequently use the
term <em>anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>, each time in reference to the Buddha’s
final Nibbāna at death. For example, the Buddha claimed that his
complexion is particularly resplendent on two occasions, on the night of
his enlightenment and on the day of his final Nibbāna in the Nibbāna
element without remainder.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn52-1"><a href="#fn-fn52">52</a></sup> Almsfood offered to the Buddha is
exceptionally meritorious on two occasions: the meal offered before his
enlightenment and the meal before his final Nibbāna in the Nibbāna
element without remainder.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn53-1"><a href="#fn-fn53">53</a></sup> {392}</p>
<p>There are further examples: the location of the Buddha’s final Nibbāna
in the Nibbāna element without remainder is one of the four Buddhist
holy places.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn54-1"><a href="#fn-fn54">54</a></sup> The Buddha’s final Nibbāna in the Nibbāna element
without remainder is one cause for the earth to quake.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn55-1"><a href="#fn-fn55">55</a></sup> Another
passage explains that the Buddha is called the ’Tathāgata’ because:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Between the night in which the Buddha gains supreme enlightenment and
the night in which he attains the Nibbāna element without remainder,
whatever he proclaims, says, or explains is so and not otherwise.</p>
<p><em>D. III. 135; It. 121-2; Nd2. 41.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>There are many other scriptural passages with a similar theme and an
identical sequence to the teaching on the two kinds of Nibbāna above.
The only difference is that they do not distinguish these kinds of
Nibbāna. For the sake of comparison, here are some examples:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>A.</em> When a bhikkhu has abandoned ignorance and aroused true
knowledge, then, with the discarding of ignorance and the arising of
true knowledge, he does not generate a meritorious volitional
formation, or a demeritorious volitional formation, or an
imperturbable volitional formation. Since he does not generate or
fashion volitional formations he does not cling to anything in the
world. Not clinging, he is not agitated.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn56-1"><a href="#fn-fn56">56</a></sup> Not being agitated, he
personally attains Nibbāna. He understands: ’Destroyed is birth, the
holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is
no more for this state of being.’</p>
<p><em>B.</em> If he feels a pleasant feeling, he understands: ’It is
impermanent’; he understands: ’It is not indulged in’; he understands:
’It is not delighted in’ (anabhinandita). If he feels a painful
feeling, he understands: ’it is impermanent’; he understands: ’it is
not indulged in’; he understands: ’it is not delighted in.’ If he
feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands: ’it is
impermanent’; he understands: ’It is not indulged in’; he understands:
’It is not delighted in.’ If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it
detached; if he feels a painful feeling, he feels it detached; if he
feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it detached. If
he feels a feeling limited by the body (by way of the five physical
sense doors), he understands: ’I feel a feeling limited by the body.’
When he feels a feeling limited by life (by way of the mind door), he
understands: ’I feel a feeling limited by life.’ He understands: ’With
the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion of life, all that is
felt (vedayitāni), not being delighted in (anabhinandita), will become
cool right here (at the twelve sense spheres); mere bodily remains
will be left.’</p>
<p><em>C.</em> Suppose, bhikkhus, a person would remove a hot clay pot from a
potter’s kiln and set it on smooth ground: its heat would be
dissipated right there and the fired pot would be left. So too, when
he feels a feeling limited to the body … limited to life … he
understands: ’With the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion
of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool
right here; mere bodily remains will be left.’ {393}</p>
<p><em>Paragraphs A., B. and C.: S. II. 82-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>D.</em> Bhikkhus, just as an oil lamp burns in dependence on the oil and
the wick, and with the exhaustion of the oil and the wick it is
extinguished through lack of fuel, so too, when a bhikkhu feels a
feeling limited to the body … limited to life … he understands:
’With the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion of life, all
that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right
here.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn57-1"><a href="#fn-fn57">57</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. III. 244-5; S. III. 126; S. IV. 213; S. V. 319-20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>There is, however, one passage with a varying description and analogy:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The monk whose heart is perfectly released attains six constant
abiding states. Seeing a form with the eye, he is neither elated nor
depressed, but rests equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending.
Hearing a sound with the ear … smelling a scent with the nose …
tasting a savour with the tongue … contacting a tangible object with
the body … cognizing mental states with the mind, he is neither
elated nor depressed, but rests equanimous, mindful, and clearly
comprehending.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn58-1"><a href="#fn-fn58">58</a></sup> When he feels a feeling limited by the body, he
understands: ’I feel a feeling limited by the body.’ When he feels a
feeling limited by life, he understands: ’I feel a feeling limited by
life.’ He understands: ’With the breakup of the body, following the
exhaustion of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will
become cool right here.’</p>
<p>Suppose that a shadow is cast by a tree. Along comes a man with an axe
and basket, and cuts the tree at the trunk. He then digs and pulls out
the roots, even the rootlets and root fibres. He chops that tree into
logs, and having done so chops the logs into chips. The chips he dries
in wind and sun, then burns them with fire and makes an ash-heap. The
ashes he winnows in a strong wind or lets them be carried away by a
swiftly flowing river. That shadow cast by the tree is cut off by the
root, made like a palm tree stump, made not to become again, of a
nature not to arise again. In the same way, a monk whose heart is
perfectly released attains six constant abiding states … all that is
felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn59-1"><a href="#fn-fn59">59</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. II. 198-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>For a thorough understanding of the two kinds of Nibbāna, let us go back
and examine the commentarial explanations. {394} As mentioned earlier,
the term <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em> is used in the Pali Canon to describe an
event – the death of an arahant – in particular of the Buddha.
However, the commentaries began to use the term <em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em>
to describe an event as well, as can be seen by comparing two passages
describing the same event:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pali Canon:</em></p>
<p>These two alms-givings are of very great fruit, of very great result,
more fruitful and advantageous than any other. Which two? The one is
the alms-giving after eating which the Tathāgata attains supreme
enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the Nibbāna
element without remainder at his final passing.</p>
<p><em>D. II. 135-6; Ud. 85.</em></p>
<p><em>Commentary:</em></p>
<p>The Buddha, having eaten the almsfood offered by Sujātā, attained the
supreme enlightenment of the Nibbāna element with remainder. Having
eaten the almsfood offered by Cunda, he attained the Nibbāna element
without remainder at his final passing.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn60-1"><a href="#fn-fn60">60</a></sup></p>
<p><em>DA. II. 571; UdA. 405.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Constant Nibbāna</span><a id="note-constant-nibbana"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a manner of speaking one can say that <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em> is the
state of Nibbāna that is constant, both throughout an arahant’s life
and after death. <em>Sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em> is the ’superficial’ state of
Nibbāna (as if overlapping), existing between the time of full
enlightenment and death. When an arahant dies only
<em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em> remains. This explanation, however, may be
deviating from the practical emphasis of Buddha-Dhamma, veering in the
direction of philosophical reasoning.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the development of meaning of these two terms, they were applied in
many commentarial passages to indicate events in the life of the Buddha
or the arahants. They are used to emphasize the realization of certain
states, rather than the nature of the states themselves.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn61-1"><a href="#fn-fn61">61</a></sup> From the
commentarial perspective, the meaning of these two kinds of Nibbāna is
restricted. <em>Sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em> here refers to the extinguishing of
defilements with the five aggregates remaining, to the Nibbāna of an
arahant while still alive, that is, to the attainment of arahantship.
<em>Anupādisesa-nibbāna</em> refers to the ending of defilements with no
aggregates remaining, that is, to the death of an arahant. The
commentators define <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em>, in particular, by applying
the principle of ’final mind’ or ’final consciousness’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn62-1"><a href="#fn-fn62">62</a></sup> limiting
the meaning to refer to an arahant’s death.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn63-1"><a href="#fn-fn63">63</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentaries interpret canonical passages relating to arahants by
distinguishing between <em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em> and <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna.</em>
For example, from the Canon: {395}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Because of the utter end of craving, its remainderless fading away and
cessation, [this is] Nibbāna. For a monk who has thus been quenched,
free from grasping, there is no renewed birth.</p>
<p><em>Ud. 33.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The commentaries assert that the first sentence of this passage refers
to the Nibbāna element with remainder, and the second sentence refers to
the Nibbāna element without remainder.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn64-1"><a href="#fn-fn64">64</a></sup> This interpretation accords
with the canonical passages presented earlier.</p>
<p>Combining these commentarial explanations, we can summarize the meaning
of these two kinds of Nibbāna as follows:</p>
<p>The Nibbāna element with remainder is the end of defilement and craving,
leading to harmless, peaceful and beneficial interaction with the world,
and relates to awakening or arahantship. The Nibbāna element without
remainder is the end of being bound to the five aggregates, of mental
proliferation, of birth and continued existence, and it relates to the
end of life in the world. The Nibbāna relating to the activity of the
five sense faculties is <em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em>; the Nibbāna free from
the five sense faculties is <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em>. In short, the end of
defilement is <em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em>, the end of birth is
<em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em> (see
Note <a href="#note-constant-nibbana">Constant Nibbāna</a>).</p>
<p>The first term refers to the Nibbāna of an arahant who is still alive;
all mental impurities have been removed, but the five aggregates still
exist. This corresponds with the term coined by the commentators:
<em>kilesa-parinibbāna</em> (eradication of defilements). The second term
refers to the Nibbāna of an arahant after death, corresponding with the
commentarial term <em>khandha-parinibbāna</em> (release from the
aggregates).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn65-1"><a href="#fn-fn65">65</a></sup></p>
<p>In fact, the evidence in the Pali Canon shows that not much significance
was given to these two kinds of Nibbāna. What are highlighted are the
things that can be applied to realize Nibbāna clearly for oneself.
Lengthy theorizing on these two kinds of Nibbāna is likely to complicate
a matter that is actually straightforward, and may lead to students of
Buddhism overemphasizing their importance.</p>
<p>If the examination of the nature of Nibbāna becomes too technical, there
is the risk that people will form misleading conceptions. This is
because the person presenting the explanation may not translate
important words accurately and clearly, and the person receiving the
teaching may have limited understanding about terms or points of Dhamma.
The misunderstanding may be reinforced by people’s emotions; for
example, one may read the technical terms above and form an impression
of an arahant as someone heartless and indifferent. {396}</p>
<p>Therefore, to prevent such misunderstandings, it is important to
accompany the study of theoretical teachings with practical application,
to see how theory and practice complement one another. An examination
into the essential meaning of the theoretical teachings and their
expression as real human attributes reveals how these teachings, which
may at first seem contradictory, are compatible and mutually supportive.</p>
<h2 id="jhāna-nirodha-and-nibbāna"><a class="header" href="#jhāna-nirodha-and-nibbāna">Jhāna, Nirodha and Nibbāna</a></h2>
<p>At this point, let us examine another way of distinguishing kinds of
Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Besides stating that the attainment of jhāna<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn66-1"><a href="#fn-fn66">66</a></sup> is a good basis for
realizing Nibbāna, the Buddha sometimes used the term jhāna to imply
Nibbāna or to show related features. For example, the Buddha referred to
the four fine-material jhānas, the four immaterial jhānas, and the
’cessation of perception and feeling’ (<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn67-1"><a href="#fn-fn67">67</a></sup> as
’temporary Nibbāna’ (<em>tadaṅga-nibbāna</em>; alternatively, ’Nibbāna by
substitution of opposites’), ’visible Nibbāna’ (<em>diṭṭhadhamma-nibbāna</em>),
and ’Nibbāna to be seen by oneself’ (<em>sandiṭṭhika-nibbāna</em>),
respectively.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn68-1"><a href="#fn-fn68">68</a></sup> Further examples of Nibbāna being used in connection
with spiritual attainments include:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A bhikkhu, secluded from sensual pleasure, secluded from unwholesome
states, attains the first jhāna. Even this much the Blessed One calls
direct Nibbāna by representation….<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn69-1"><a href="#fn-fn69">69</a></sup> {401} Going beyond the
sphere of neither perception nor non-perception, attaining the
cessation of perception and feeling, by seeing with wisdom, all
cankers are destroyed. Even this much the Blessed One calls direct,
immediate Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn70-1"><a href="#fn-fn70">70</a></sup></p>
<p>[A practitioner of insight meditation] understands form, feeling,
perception, volitional formations and consciousness as impermanent,
subject to stress, and subject to change. He abandons sorrow,
lamentation, (etc.), is free from agitation and worry, and dwells
happily. He is said to be quenched in that respect
(tadaṅga-nibbāna).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn71-1"><a href="#fn-fn71">71</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. III. 43.</em></p>
<p>When a person is overwhelmed by lust … hatred … and delusion, then
he plans for his own harm, for the harm of others, for the harm of
both; and he experiences in his mind suffering and grief. But when
lust, hatred and delusion have been abandoned, he neither plans for
this own harm, nor for the harm of others, not for the harm of both;
and he does not experience in his mind suffering and grief. In this
way, Nibbāna is directly visible, timeless, inviting one to come and
see, to be brought within and realized, to be personally experienced
by the wise.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 158-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Paṭisambhidāmagga divides <em>nirodha</em>, which is an important synonym
for Nibbāna, into five categories:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn72-1"><a href="#fn-fn72">72</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Vikkhambhana-nirodha</em>: the suppression of the five hindrances in
the first jhāna. (In fact, all eight concentrative attainments –
<em>samāpatti</em> – i.e. the four fine-material and the four immaterial
jhānas count as <em>vikkhambhana-nirodha</em>, because, while abiding in
all of these states, unwholesome qualities, e.g. the hindrances, are
temporarily stilled.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tadaṅga-nirodha</em>: the stage at which concentration (<em>samādhi</em>)
begins to dispel the defilements;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn73-1"><a href="#fn-fn73">73</a></sup> wrong views are vanquished by
the substitution of opposite qualities. This stage implies the
dispelling of defilements through insight and the use of wisdom to
examine the true nature of things, for example the nature of
impermanence. Whatever truth is focused on, knowledge arises to
eliminate antagonistic views and attachments. For example, seeing
oneself or others as merely mind and body (<em>nāma-rūpa</em>) dispels the
view of fixed identity (<em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>), observing impermanence
dispels the perception of permanence (<em>nicca-saññā</em>), acknowledging
<em>dukkha</em> dispels the perception of unchanging happiness
(<em>sukha-saññā</em>), and reflecting on selflessness dispels the
perception of a fixed self (<em>atta-saññā</em>). This cessation is similar
to turning on a light and dispelling darkness, but it is still a
temporary cessation – as soon as the light is extinguished darkness
returns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samuccheda-nirodha</em>: the cutting off of defilements by one who
develops the supermundane paths (<em>lokuttara-magga</em>), i.e. the paths
of stream-entry (<em>sotāpatti-magga</em>), once-returning
(<em>sakadāgāmi-magga</em>), non-returning (<em>anāgāmi-magga</em>), and
arahantship (<em>arahatta-magga</em>). The defilements, e.g. the ten
fetters, cease irrevocably, never to return, like a tree that has
been uprooted or shattered by lightening. {402}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paṭipassaddhi-nirodha</em>: the utter stilling of defilements at the
moment of supermundane fruition (<em>lokuttara-phala</em>): the noble
fruition of stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning and
arahantship. This is a state of profound tranquillity, due to the
complete removal of mental impurity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nissaraṇa-nirodha</em>: the release from defilements; an abiding
untouched by defilement. This cessation is equivalent to Nibbāna,
also called <em>amata-dhātu</em> (’deathless element’), the state of
deliverance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two qualities, <em>vikkhambhana-</em> and <em>tadaṅga-nirodha</em>, are
mundane; the remaining three are supermundane. The first four qualities
are called Nibbāna ’indirectly’ or ’in some respects’ (<em>pariyāya</em>). The
fifth quality refers to Nibbāna directly (<em>nippariyāya</em>), in its full
and true meaning.</p>
<p>The Paṭisambhidāmagga divides <em>pahāna</em> (abandoning), <em>viveka</em>
(seclusion), <em>virāga</em> (dispassion), and <em>vossagga</em> (release) each into
the five identical qualities as with <em>nirodha</em> above, with identical
definitions and meanings.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn74-1"><a href="#fn-fn74">74</a></sup> The commentaries divide <em>vimutti</em>
(liberation) in the same way.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn75-1"><a href="#fn-fn75">75</a></sup></p>
<p>A well-known division into realizations of Nibbāna is the division into
path (<em>magga</em>) and fruit (<em>phala</em>), or into the four paths and four
fruits, i.e. <em>sotāpatti-magga</em>, <em>sotāpatti-phala</em>, <em>sakadāgāmi-magga</em>,
<em>sakadāgāmi-phala</em>, <em>anāgāmi-magga</em>, <em>anāgāmi-phala</em>, <em>arahatta-magga</em>,
and <em>arahatta-phala</em>. This division, however, is made in connection with
enlightened beings, who will be discussed in the next chapter. At this
point, let me simply remind the reader that <em>magga</em> and <em>phala</em> are not
Nibbāna, but rather stages or levels of realization.</p>
<h2 id="anattā-and-nibbāna"><a class="header" href="#anattā-and-nibbāna">Anattā and Nibbāna</a></h2>
<p>{440} Several misunderstandings exist about Nibbāna and its relationship
to the principle of nonself (<em>anattā</em>). The word <em>anattā</em> often becomes
linked with beliefs from other religious traditions. There are two such
beliefs in particular: first, the theory of union with a supreme reality
or being, for example with Brahma, God, or a higher consciousness. This
theory propounds the inseparable dissolving into or joining of the self
with a supreme reality. This state of union is then called nonself.</p>
<p>The second belief is the resolute dedication of service to a divinity
with no concern for oneself, with no selfish desire. A person practising
this way is said to be ’selfless’, and such practice is seen as
identical to the <em>anattā</em> of Buddhism.</p>
<p>In truth, these two beliefs are alien to the Buddhist teaching of
nonself. As there are almost no common features, comparing them with the
Buddhist understanding of nonself is flawed.</p>
<p><em>Anattā</em> in Buddhism is a characteristic of all things, a truth
pertaining to all existence. This principle is to be investigated with
wisdom and understood, that essentially all things are insubstantial.
Things exist and proceed according to their own nature; they possess no
core, hidden essence, overlapping reality, or controlling agent, which
can validly be clung to as a self. A lucid understanding (<em>ñāṇa</em> or
<em>vijjā</em>) of this leads to a liberated heart, which is not encumbered or
enslaved by anything. This is liberation by way of wisdom
(<em>paññā-vimutti</em>).</p>
<p>In this sense, <em>anattā</em> is not a matter of an existent self dissolving
into or unifying with anything.</p>
<p>Some people equate a union with a Supreme Being or higher consciousness
with Nibbāna. Putting these claims aside, even some idiomatic phrases in
Buddhist circles can cause confusion and lead to misunderstanding, for
example: ’attaining final Nibbāna’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn76-1"><a href="#fn-fn76">76</a></sup> and ’reaching the great
deathless citadel of Nibbāna’. Why introduce abstruse and ambiguous
theories from other sources to make one’s understanding even more
muddled?</p>
<p>Normally, the Buddhist teachings use simple, easy to understand
expressions when explaining Nibbāna, for example: ’the end of impurity’,
’the end of agitation’, and ’a heart that is free, unrestricted,
griefless, bright, and joyous’. These descriptions are sufficient – one
need not merge or unify with anything.</p>
<p>An arahant’s heart is spacious, limitless, and perfectly free; no
thought arises about becoming one with anything. On the contrary, it is
unenlightened people who conjecture on an arahant’s state of mind, which
more likely reveals their longing for certainty, fear of extinction, and
lingering doubt.</p>
<p>The equation of Nibbāna with losing oneself into a supreme entity that
involves the mind ceasing to consciously engage and entering a
trance-like state is also false. For even in the correct practice of
<em>jhāna</em>, in which the mind is deeply concentrated and one-pointed,
mindfulness is still clearly established and mental agility is enhanced;
it is not a trance. The fourth <em>jhāna</em>, in particular, is endowed with
the attribute: ’equanimity that purifies mindfulness’
(<em>upekkhā-satipārisuddhiṁ</em>). And in relation to penetrative knowledge,
descriptions of the fourth jhāna end with this passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>With mind concentrated, purified and cleansed, unblemished, free from
impurities, malleable, workable, established, and having gained

<p>There is a general criterion one can use in light of this discussion.
Regardless of how deeply absorbed the mind is in an exalted state, or to
what level it has merged with a supreme truth, as long as the mental
impurities have not been eradicated by wisdom, which discerns
conditionality and the true nature of the world, that is, as long as one
has not reached ’deliverance by wisdom’ (<em>paññā-vimutti</em>), one can not
yet claim to have attained Nibbāna. Without this deliverance, the
profound and absorptive states remain confined to psychic or
concentrative achievements, and the release from the clutches of
defilement is merely a temporary suppression or abeyance, lasting only
so long as the force of mind can be maintained.</p>
<p>The principle of selfless or altruistic conduct is also not the same as
<em>anattā</em>. There is a similarity, in that a clear discernment of <em>anattā</em>
brings about an end of selfishness. Indeed, selfishness is only truly
uprooted with insight into the nature of nonself. Both understanding
selflessness and humble submission to a deity lead to selfless conduct.
The similarity extends this far. {441} The first is a wise investigation
of truth leading to liberation. The second is an application of faith,
leading to intense devotion to the object of that faith, not distracted
by personal concerns. We may then ask the question: Which of these
practices is a temporary self-abandonment, and which an utter and
complete removal of self-preoccupation?</p>
<p>The term <em>anattā</em> can be applied in a practical context regarding
selfless behaviour. Here, the term refers to the possession of
mindfulness and clear comprehension, leading to thorough
self-understanding. The mind is fully aware of the activity in which it
is engaged, to the extent that no opportunity arises for concepts of a
fixed identity to impinge and hijack the process of awareness. In this
context, <em>anattā</em> means ’knowing the insubstantiality of all things’.</p>
<p>Finally, it is common for contemporary Buddhists to use expressions
relating to the self (<em>attā</em>) and nonself in an ethical context. For
example: ’this person has a strong ego’, ’deflate (or annihilate) your
ego’, ’he acts to boost his ego’, These colloquial expressions simply
refer to a fixed belief in self or to an adherence to a self-image, and
are used for convenience. They are not meant to imply an actual existing
self. The common and widespread use of these expressions, however, leads
some people to confuse or distort the meaning of <em>anattā</em>, to the extent
that it strays entirely from its original Buddhist connotation.</p>

<p>{487} Nibbāna, the highest goal of Buddhism, can be realized by people
in this present life, when they apply effort and are endowed with the
necessary spiritual qualities. One need not wait until the next life, as
revealed by the dual attributes of Nibbāna: <em>sandiṭṭhiko</em> (seen clearly
by oneself; realizable in this life) and <em>akāliko</em> (not subject to time;
timeless; immediate).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn78-1"><a href="#fn-fn78">78</a></sup> The Buddha offered ways of practice for
realizing Nibbāna in this present life,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn79-1"><a href="#fn-fn79">79</a></sup> as confirmed in this
passage:</p>

enter upon and abide in that supreme goal of the holy life for the
sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into

<p>Every person with determination and spiritual aptitude can realize
Nibbāna. No restrictions exist concerning race, class, caste, wealth,
gender, or whether one is a householder or monastic, as verified by the
Buddha’s verses:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>

</div>
<p>The Buddha permitted women to be ordained as bhikkhunis (<em>bhikkhunī</em>)
despite the opposition by elements of Indian society at that time; he
claimed that women who follow the Dhammavinaya are capable of realizing
supermundane states, from stream-entry to arahantship, equally as
men.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn81-1"><a href="#fn-fn81">81</a></sup></p>

<p>Somā Therī replied:</p>

</div>
<p>The Buddha frequently discussed the issue of caste, which was an
important point of debate and controversy in India at that time. One
example is the discussion between the Buddha and the brahmin Esukārī:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’Master Gotama, the brahmins prescribe four types of wealth: … they
prescribe wandering for alms as the wealth of a brahmin … the bow
and the quiver as the wealth of a noble … farming and
cattle-breeding as the wealth of a merchant … the sickle and
carrying-pole as the wealth of a worker…. What does Master Gotama
say about this?’ {489}</p>
<p>’Well, brahmin, has all the world authorized the brahmins to prescribe
these four types of wealth?’ – ’No, Master Gotama.’ – ’Suppose,
brahmin, they were to force a cut of meat upon a poor, penniless,
destitute man and tell him: “Good man, you must eat this meat and pay
for it”; so too, without the consent of those [other] recluses and
brahmins, the brahmins nevertheless prescribe these four types of
wealth.</p>
<p>’I, brahmin, declare the noble supermundane Dhamma as a person’s own
wealth…. What do you think, brahmin? Suppose a head-anointed noble
king were to assemble here a hundred men of different birth and say to
them: “Come, sirs, let any here who have been born into a noble clan
or a brahmin clan or a royal clan take a fire-stick of teak, sal-wood,
pine, sandal-wood, or pomegranate wood and light a fire and produce
heat. And also let any who have been born into an outcast clan, a
trapper clan, a wicker workers’ clan, a cartwrights’ clan, or a
scavengers’ clan take a fire–stick made from a dog’s drinking trough,
from a pig’s trough, from a dying vat, or from castor-oil wood and
light a fire and produce heat.”</p>
<p>’What do you think, brahmin? When a fire is lit and heat is produced
by someone in the first group, would that fire have a flame, a colour,
and a radiance, and would it be possible to use it for the purposes of
fire, while when a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone of the
second group, that fire would have no flame, no colour, and no
radiance, and it would not be possible to use it for the purposes of
fire?’</p>
<p>’No, Master Gotama…. For all fire has a flame, a colour, and a
radiance, and it is possible to use all fire for the purposes of
fire.’</p>
<p>’So too, brahmin, if anyone from a clan of nobles goes forth from the
home life into homelessness, and relying on the Dhamma and Discipline
proclaimed by the Tathāgata … holds right view, he is one who
fulfils the wholesome qualities that are the way of deliverance. If
anyone from a clan of brahmins goes forth … from a clan of merchants
… from a clan of workers goes forth from the home life into
homelessness, and relying on the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by
the Tathāgata … holds right view, he is one who fulfils the
wholesome qualities that are the way of deliverance.’ {490}</p>

<h3 id="nibbāna-is-the-highest-spiritual-attainment"><a class="header" href="#nibbāna-is-the-highest-spiritual-attainment">Nibbāna Is the Highest Spiritual Attainment</a></h3>
<p>Although the attainment of Nibbāna is dependent on mental deliverance
(<em>cetovimutti</em>), that is, it relies on a particular achievement of
<em>jhāna</em>, and this achievement has a bearing on the everyday life of
enlightened beings, Nibbāna is distinct from <em>jhāna</em>. Nibbāna is a
release even from these psychic achievements and is accessible when one
is able to transcend them. There are some unique aspects to the
attainment of Nibbāna:</p>
<p>The realization of Nibbāna is decisive, final and irreversible. In
regard to moral conduct, for example, true spontaneous selflessness
arises. This selfless conduct stems from eradication by wisdom of
selfish hankering, to the point that all self-obsession is abolished.</p>
<p>As this selflessness arises naturally and of its own accord, it is not
the result of willpower or force; one need not seize one opinion or
habit in order to let go of another. One need not hold up some ideal,
sacrifice oneself to an object of faith, suppress one’s passions by calm
or insight, or get absorbed in <em>jhāna</em>.</p>
<p>No matter how lofty a person’s mental achievements, one must see into
their causal nature and let go of attachment to these achievements
before realization of Nibbāna is possible.</p>
<p>This letting go ultimately supports, consolidates, and perfects further
spiritual development, even for enlightened beings.</p>
<p>For example, such beings can benefit from proficiency in <em>jhāna</em> in
order to abide in a state of ease and happiness
(<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>) when they are not engaged in other
activities. If originally they accessed the eight levels of <em>jhāna</em>,
with the realization as a non-returner or an arahant, they may achieve
’cessation of perception and feeling’ (<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>).</p>
<p>Some spiritual accomplishments can suspend defilements and suffering for
a long period, but not yet irrevocably. The defilements and suffering
can return, and therefore these heightened mental states are temporary;
they are a means to suppress other conditions or to engage the mind in
something else. The realization of Nibbāna, however, puts an absolute
end to suffering and mental impurities. And through this realization,
only harmful conditions cease, for example: greed, craving, anger, woe,
confusion, fixed views of self, and ignorance; all goodness remains.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the vices are automatically replaced by the exceptional
wholesome qualities of a life guided by wisdom and compassion, which
surpass ordinary happiness and cannot be securely accessed by other
spiritual achievements. {491}</p>
<p>Therefore, although a person who has realized Nibbāna may not have
experienced the most refined states of <em>jhāna</em>, he or she is still
superior to someone who has these experiences but is as yet not fully
enlightened.</p>
<p>The realization of Nibbāna brings about a fundamental transformation of
a person’s heart, personality, thinking process, worldview and
behaviour. There are two principal aspects to this mental
transformation. The first involves knowledge, understanding, opinions,
and beliefs, which pertain to ignorance and wisdom. The second involves
a person’s sense of values or relationship to desire, which pertains to
craving and wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>).</p>
<p>A student who believes her teacher will criticize and punish her may
tremble at the thought of meeting the teacher, whereas if she knows that
the teacher is kind she will feel happy and at ease. People who see
others as enemies and those who see others as friends will behave
differently. A person finding a map that shows the location of a hidden
diamond may risk his life and even kill others for that treasure, while
another person may not give it much thought. People desiring pleasurable
sights, tastes, fragrances, sounds, and tangible objects tend to be
engrossed with these things. If they believe that they can truly possess
these objects then their happiness is dependent on their acquisition.</p>
<p>In contrast, fully enlightened beings understand the world as it really
is, they see nothing that can be truly owned or controlled, they go
beyond the search for pleasurable sensations, and they recognize how to
act in harmony with truth. They do not yearn for sense impressions. As a
consequence, a new understanding arises of one’s relationship to the
world, including material possessions, other people, nature, and even
one’s own life. One is of the world but not bound to or tarnished by it.</p>
<p>This liberation and inner transformation is difficult to describe and
therefore the scriptures explain it with similes, for example:
recovering from an illness, sobering up, cooling down, clearing out
refuse, escaping from a snare or chain, and crossing over an expanse of
water to a safe haven.</p>
<p>Many of these similes depict the happiness of relieving an original
entanglement, inconvenience, confinement and struggle. The release from
these constraints to a state of freedom and safety is Nibbāna.
Enlightened persons can move about as they please, without worrying
about self-protection. Some of the above similes can be used for other
spiritual achievements; the difference lies in the fact that <em>jhāna</em>,
for instance, provides only temporary results. {492}</p>
<p>In every time period, at least a small percentage of human beings will
seek the meaning and ultimate goal of life, beyond merely being born,
searching for sense pleasure, and dying. Sometimes material difficulties
or a struggle for survival will cause them to temporarily neglect or
interrupt their search, but when circumstances permit and as long as
doubt persists people will concern themselves with these matters.
Therefore any creed or philosophy that merely answers to material
comfort and does not meet people’s spiritual needs is incomplete and
unable to offer adequate satisfaction. To use Buddhist terminology,
responding to ’mundane welfare’ (<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>) alone is
insufficient; one must also attend to ’spiritual welfare’
(<em>samparāyikattha</em>) and ’supreme welfare’ (<em>paramattha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn83-1"><a href="#fn-fn83">83</a></sup> The
teachings on Nibbāna and other spiritual achievements fulfil this
requirement. Some psychic attainments, however, although surpassing
mundane phenomena, are still classified as subordinate, that is, one is
encouraged to reach the final stage of Nibbāna, the supreme benefit and
true perfection.</p>
<h2 id="common-misunderstandings-about-nibbāna"><a class="header" href="#common-misunderstandings-about-nibbāna">Common Misunderstandings about Nibbāna</a></h2>
<h3 id="attaching-to-non-attachment"><a class="header" href="#attaching-to-non-attachment">Attaching To Non-attachment</a></h3>
<p>The origin of suffering can be identified with its two primary agents:
ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>) and craving (<em>taṇhā</em>). Likewise, the cessation of
suffering can be identified with two essential qualities: knowledge
(<em>vijjā</em>) and deliverance (<em>vimutti</em>). The former process may be
described as ’ignorance leading to attachment’, and the latter as
’deliverance through knowledge’.</p>
<p>In the former process, the link which leads to birth and becoming is
<em>upādāna</em>, translated as ’grasping’, ’clinging’, or ’attachment’. In the
latter process, the link which leads out of the round of rebirth
(<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>) is <em>nibbidā</em>, translated as ’disenchantment’ or
’dispassion’: the end of craving and attachment. As a pair <em>upādāna</em> and
<em>nibbidā</em> are polar opposites.</p>
<p><em>Upādāna</em> stems indirectly from not knowing the true nature of things.
This not-knowing opens the door to craving – the wish to possess and
consume things. Craving leads to getting tied up and investing in things
being a certain way, which is <em>upādāna</em>.</p>
<p>In contrast, <em>nibbidā</em> springs from a thorough understanding of those
things formerly attached to; one understands their faults and dangers,
and one sees the harm of getting obsessed with them. This gives rise to
disenchantment; one is no longer fascinated by these things and is
willing to relinquish them. Disenchantment arises from knowing the true
nature of things; this knowledge is called <em>yathābhūta-ñāṇadassana</em>.
{493}</p>
<p>It is important to note that both the arising of disenchantment and the
eradication of clinging are due to knowledge. With a true understanding
of things, <em>nibbidā</em> arises and <em>upādāna</em> ceases automatically; it is a
natural causal process or a state that arises following causes and
conditions.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn84-1"><a href="#fn-fn84">84</a></sup></p>
<p>One sometimes hears the injunction ’don’t be attached’, ’let go’, or
’all that is necessary is non-clinging’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn85-1"><a href="#fn-fn85">85</a></sup> This teaching is laudable,
but one should bear in mind that non-attachment needs to arise correctly
in line with a natural process. If it does not, one’s practice may be
incorrect and even harmful. The risk is that one attaches to
non-attachment, which can have the same detrimental effects as clinging
to anything else.</p>
<p>Imagine that a beautifully wrapped bundle has been placed within a
locked glass case. A man sees the bundle and is convinced that it
contains something valuable. He is fixated on obtaining that object, but
is unable to get at it. Later, someone whom he respects tells him that
there is nothing of value in that bundle and that coveting it is
harmful. One part of the man wants to believe this advice and realizes
the damaging effects of his actions, but on a deeper level he is still
convinced the bundle contains a treasure. He is unable to sever his
longing through will-power, although he tries to prove to others that he
has let go. His outward behaviour displays a disinterest for the bundle,
but even if he were to loudly broadcast this, his heart is still bound.
Moreover, in his attempt to show others he does not care, he may behave
oddly and inappropriately.</p>
<p>Later the contents of the bundle are revealed to the man and he sees
that they are indeed worthless. Knowing this clearly for himself the
hankering then ceases immediately. Even if he were to try and convince
himself to desire the object he would remain disinterested. His mind is
prepared to engage fully with other things. {494}</p>
<p>The behaviour above can be compared to that of unawakened persons, whose
desires and attachments are influenced by craving. They may have been
told that their desired objects are essentially undesirable and that
their attachment is potentially harmful. They may agree through
reasoning that the desire and attachment is harmful and want to believe
that the longed for objects are of no value, but they do not yet truly
see it this way. Deep down the desire and attachment remains. They may
seemingly be disinterested in those pleasurable things, but this
disinterest or non-attachment is not genuine and is a form of posturing.
They are simply conforming behaviour to an idea of non-attachment. Their
non-attachment is a form of attachment and their actions are dictated by
this attachment. This can result in disingenuous or eccentric behaviour.</p>
<p>In contrast, when one understands the true nature of conditioned
phenomena, that specific conditions bring about inevitable results, the
heart is delivered and grasping ceases of its own accord. One’s
behaviour is then natural and uncontrived. {495}</p>
<p>Returning to the former example of the man who desires the bundle, his
friend may explain the entire sequence of how the bundle and its
worthless contents were prepared. Following this reasoning the man may
be convinced that the contents are indeed valueless. This firm
conviction may have a strong bearing on his thoughts and actions.
Although he is not yet completely free of desire, only a mild longing
remains, quite different from his initial passion. This is similar to
the knowledge and state of mind of persons who have achieved the first
three stages of enlightenment, from stream-enterers to non-returners –
those ranked between ordinary people and arahants.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn86-1"><a href="#fn-fn86">86</a></sup></p>
<p>Examples from everyday life that reveal a person’s true level of
non-attachment are the emotions of worry and fear. Some people feel
nervous, seemingly for no reason. Even scolding themselves for this
feeling does not help. A person may be in a safe place with no cause for
fear, but as soon as he hears the cry of a wild animal or a siren he
involuntarily gets frightened. Rational thought alone cannot uproot
these emotions – one must get to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>Ordinary people, without deep insight, may ask if they should practise
non-attachment. Because the recognition of the dangers of attachment is
beneficial, they are advised to practise in this way. They should bear
in mind, however, that they still abide at one level of attachment and
that it is detrimental to believe prematurely that they have attained
true non-attachment. By acting judiciously and wisely, the harmful
consequences of excessive and deceptive behaviour are avoided. This
virtuous conduct and self-discipline creates a foundation for genuine
non-attachment in the future.</p>
<p>Although attaching to non-attachment is usually well-intentioned, there
are those with ill intent who may argue that since all things are
insubstantial and people are made up of component parts, no one exists
in any real sense; therefore it is acceptable to harm others. This is
simply an extreme form of attachment; they are selecting an aspect of
truth to justify their own desires. If they were not in some way
obsessed with the victim and had no evil intent, why would they wish to
cause the person harm?</p>
<h3 id="overestimation"><a class="header" href="#overestimation">Overestimation</a></h3>
<p>Most people are preoccupied by material concerns. When they experience
subtle, unfamiliar spiritual events, they are easily impressed. But
because they lack a fundamental understanding of the workings of the
mind, they are unable to distinguish between the different experiences
and get confused. Even skilled practitioners can have this problem. An
analytical or reflective ability goes a long way to prevent
misunderstanding and misguided effort.</p>
<p>People who are fascinated with miracles and the supernatural tend to
praise those with psychic powers and believe they have reached the
highest spiritual goal. Likewise, someone who is keen on solitude,
develops the mind, and has tasted the joy of seclusion will often instil
faith in others, even if he or she has not yet reached any exceptional
states of mind. {496}</p>
<p>People who have attained the fruits of serenity practice (<em>samatha</em>) –
the jhānas – will appear even more impressive. They themselves may
mistake serenity for insight, or they may overestimate their
achievements and believe to be enlightened. They may attain the ’joy of
insight’ (<em>vipassanā-sukha</em>), which is technically classified as an
impurity (<em>upakkilesa</em>), and mistake this for Nibbāna. They may get
carried away by the praise lavished by others. This is not to say that
one should be suspicious or find fault, since it is suitable to respect
those who are worthy, but one should know clearly what other people have
to offer. This way the rewards of Dhamma practice for both practitioners
and their admirers will not lead to ill-effects, and they will avoid
getting stuck in extreme asceticism or another form of wrong practice.</p>
<h3 id="happiness-and-readiness-for-happiness"><a class="header" href="#happiness-and-readiness-for-happiness">Happiness and Readiness for Happiness</a></h3>
<p>Happiness is an essential ingredient for Dhamma practice. Buddhism
encourages people to experience the different levels of happiness, in
particular the refined happiness independent of material things, which
provides a great benefit to practice. (Delight in sensual pleasures
needs no encouraging as people are preoccupied enough with this
already.) Buddhism, does not promote attachment to any kind of
happiness,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn87-1"><a href="#fn-fn87">87</a></sup> and is more interested in cultivating a readiness in
people to experience happiness than in the various states of happiness
themselves. When this state of readiness is developed, a person can
choose at will from those levels of happiness already established. This
readiness is itself an inherent form of happiness, which surpasses all
other happiness. For realized persons, who have developed this
readiness, no source of suffering remains, permitting them to experience
all forms of happiness without causing harm to themselves or others.
This inherent happiness is one vital feature of Nibbāna.</p>
<h2 id="points-of-controversy"><a class="header" href="#points-of-controversy">Points of Controversy</a></h2>
<h3 id="nibbāna-and-the-self"><a class="header" href="#nibbāna-and-the-self">Nibbāna and the Self</a></h3>
<p>Let us look once more at the questions about self (<em>attā</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the final analysis, does Buddhism acknowledge the existence of a
self?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the Buddha’s rejection of the five aggregates as self indicate
that he wished us to discover a true self beyond the body/mind?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is Nibbāna the ultimate self? {497}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several points here to bear in mind:</p>
<p>All beliefs about the self or soul spring from <em>bhava-taṇhā</em>: the desire
for eternal life. This desire incites one to seize something as stable
and lasting, leading to suppositions, beliefs and theories on self.
Initially, one takes the body as self, but as soon it is clear that the
body cannot satisfy one’s desire one searches for something else. When
even the mind cannot fulfil one’s desire, one goes further, grasping,
for instance, to exalted states encountered in <em>jhāna</em> as the true self.
Some define <em>attā</em> in a broader sense than the ego, as the source of all
things or an immortal spirit. But no matter how refined these concepts
of self, they are essentially the same, in that they satisfy the craving
for eternal life.</p>
<p>The error here does not lie with the objects identified with or grasped
onto as self. These phenomena exist according to their own nature. In
the case that they are conditioned phenomena (<em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>), for
example, they proceed according to specific causes and conditions. They
require no self, no core, no essence to interfere with, overlap, or
control their natural process. Any such fixed ’self’ would create chaos
and conflict with the insubstantial nature of things.</p>
<p>The belief in such a fixed self is thus misguided and erroneous. It is
the creation of an image or idea of something that does not in fact
truly exist. How do people fall into this error? Its root cause is the
craving for being (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>; alternatively, ’craving for
becoming’), which gives rise to grasping (<em>upādāna</em>). When people
identify with things by way of grasping, regardless of whether that
object is real or purely imaginary, they create a distorted perception
of that thing. This distorted perception then becomes an image of
’self’, which is cherished and falsely believed to be real.</p>
<p>Ideas of self depend on the relationship between craving and the object
taken to be self. The self is associated with such an object, but it
does not exist separate from the craving for being – the source of
these beliefs. {498}</p>
<p>Self-perceptions (<em>atta-saññā</em>), self-views (<em>atta-diṭṭhi</em>), and the
grasping that leads to repeated assertions of self (<em>atta-vādupādāna</em>)
are accumulated so habitually that they become deeply lodged in the
mind. When these views are contradicted, people tend to look for a
loophole and search for something else to call self.</p>
<p>The search for a replacement is proof of the urgency in maintaining a
self. When the original perception of self is threatened or ruled out,
the person fears annihilation and reaches for a new concept of self. The
basic craving for existence and self-views are still fully intact, and
nothing essentially changes by attaching to a new object. The idea of
self is merely expressed in a more elaborate and detailed way. One may
grasp onto an aspect of truth in this way, but it will result in a
misrepresentation of that truth.</p>
<p>Grasping at Nibbāna as self results in a distorted image of Nibbāna that
is masked by desire, indicating that one has not yet realized true
Nibbāna. (See
Note <a href="#note-nibbana-not-self">Nibbāna is Not a Self</a>.) Any viable solution to this problem
is prevented by the inability to abandon craving. One may acknowledge
that one’s self-view is false, but deep down this idea still conflicts
with craving and the acceptance of it is therefore not complete. When
one belief is invalidated the tendency is to search for another belief
to take its place. One may also swing to the opposite extreme: the
theory of nihilism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very important distinction between Buddhism and religions
that avow a soul or an eternal God. The absolute truth as presented by
some religions and branches of theology can appear almost identical to
that of Buddhism. The difference is that these faiths define the
highest reality in terms of a Self or Supreme Being.</p>
<p>Although adherents of these faiths may reach profound states of
consciousness, they are still caught up with the latent yet insistent
need for a self. When discussing one of these profound states, they
look for an angle or reference to label it as self in the hope that
they will continue to exist in some enduring, constant way, which
indicates that they still harbour <em>bhava-taṇhā</em>.</p>
<p>In Buddhism this mechanism is called the ’master-ensnaring net’
(<em>brahma-jāla</em>: ’the net that traps Brahma’; see the Brahmajāla-Sutta,
D. I. 12-46). More important than any concept of self is the desire
for self, which breeds all pursuit for and debates over self.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Solving this dilemma is not a matter of identifying the true self, but
rather correcting the very belief in self and addressing the root of the
problem: the craving which creates ever more elaborate ideas of self.
One must uproot self-view (<em>atta-diṭṭhi</em> or <em>attānudiṭṭhi</em>), reject the
belief in an enduring self or soul (<em>atta-vāda</em>), and abandon the
craving for existence (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>). When this craving and grasping
are abandoned, the self or the ideas of self in which one invests so
much importance are also relinquished. With this relinquishment the
question of self is concluded; one need not affix a concept of self onto
something else. The self ceases automatically with the destruction of
this native craving.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn88-1"><a href="#fn-fn88">88</a></sup> Nothing more needs to be said about the self;
the self becomes meaningless.</p>
<p>The extreme and controversial interpretation that Buddhism rejects the
five aggregates as self, yet claims that Nibbāna is the true self, is an
error resulting from misdirected focus. Proponents of this view pay too
much attention to what the Buddha rejected as self, rather than how he
rejected the self and how he rejected the attachment that gives rise to
the self.</p>
<p>The reason the Buddha chose the five aggregates as the focus in the
Three Characteristics, asserting that they are insubstantial and not
truly controllable, is because the aggregates are all that ordinary
people are able to know and conceive of.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn89-1"><a href="#fn-fn89">89</a></sup> They comprise all things
that are generally held to be self, including experiences in <em>jhāna</em>.
The Buddha’s rejection of the aggregates as self was not an
encouragement to find something else to grasp onto. The aim of his
teaching is precisely to eradicate self-view, self-attachment, and
craving for existence, not merely to know the insubstantiality of the
aggregates.</p>
<p>If the Buddha wanted us to reject the aggregates as self in order to
adopt something else as the true self, he would have made it amply clear
what that is. He would not have left us guessing and disputing. {499}</p>
<p>Nonself as part of the Three Characteristics is usually referred to in
the scriptures in the phrase: <em>All conditioned phenomena are
impermanent, all conditioned phenomena are dukkha, all things are
nonself</em> (<em>anattā</em>).</p>
<p>This passage by the Buddha shows that <em>anattā</em> has a range of meaning
broader than <em>anicca</em> and <em>dukkha</em>. The first two clauses state that all
conditioned phenomena (<em>saṅkhāra</em> or <em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>) are impermanent
and subject to stress, whereas the third clause states that all
’dhammas’ – all things – both conditioned phenomena and the
Unconditioned (<em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em> and <em>asaṅkhata-dhamma</em>, or <em>saṅkhāra</em>
and <em>visaṅkhāra</em>), are nonself.</p>
<p>And the following passage in the Parivāra of the Vinaya Piṭaka clearly
reiterates that Nibbāna is included in the clause ’all things are
nonself’: <em>All formations are impermanent, dukkha, and nonself; Nibbāna
and designations are nonself</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn90-1"><a href="#fn-fn90">90</a></sup></p>
<p>Although evidence shows that the Parivāra is a later text in the
Tipiṭaka, one must concede that this is a consensus from early,
pre-commentarial Buddhism. In any case, although such text material
exists one ought to define <em>anattā</em> with caution.</p>
<p>Even the Buddha showed caution when discussing <em>attā</em>/<em>anattā</em>. His
approach can be summarized as follows: firstly, when the listener had an
adequate basis of understanding, the Buddha would explain the nature of
the object held to be self and the grasping that needs to be abandoned,
as can be seen in his references to the five aggregates and twelve sense
bases in the teaching of the Three Characteristics. Secondly, if someone
asked him the isolated metaphysical question whether the self exists or
does not exist, the Buddha remained silent and would not answer:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>At one time the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Buddha and asked:
Is there a self? The Buddha was silent. Vacchagotta resumed: Then, is
there no self? The Buddha remained silent. Vacchagotta then rose from
his seat and departed. Later, Ven. Ānanda said to the Buddha: Why is
it that when the Blessed One was questioned by the wanderer, he did
not answer? The Buddha replied: If I had answered, ’There is a self’,
this would have been siding with those who are eternalists. If I had
answered, ’There is no self’, this would have been siding with those
who are annihilationists.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn91-1"><a href="#fn-fn91">91</a></sup> {500}</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 400.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the first manner of teaching about nonself stated above, the Buddha
points out how the things a person identifies with as self cannot be
held in any real way. When a person recognizes this misapprehension, the
dangers of grasping and the advantages of letting go become apparent.
One understands the meaning of freedom and knows how to conduct oneself
appropriately in the world, living with purpose rather than drifting
aimlessly and allowing craving to develop into a more serious mental
complex. By gaining understanding, a practitioner removes self-views and
reduces craving for existence. At the same time questions about self
gradually dissolve.</p>
<p>This way of explaining differs greatly from trying to answer
metaphysical questions about the self, which spring from people’s
craving for existence (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>) or craving for extinction
(<em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>). The craving is tied up with fixed views: either a
variant of eternalism (<em>sassata-diṭṭhi</em>) or of annihilationism
(<em>uccheda-diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
<p>Answering or repudiating these kinds of questions to someone with fixed
beliefs is risky and leads to confusion. No matter how one answers, the
person will base his conceptions upon established beliefs. If the answer
is consistent with his views, he will take this as confirmation of his
specific understanding. If inconsistent, he will conclude the opposite.
For example, if one answers that the self exists the view of a listener
biased towards eternalism will be reinforced. If one negates the self he
will go to the opposite extreme and interpret this as a form of
annihilationism. He may then develop the misguided idea that since no
self exists, persecution of others has no consequences; since no one
acts, no one receives the fruits of action and therefore why should one
perform good deeds? People form conclusions according to their cravings
and fixed opinions; these biased conclusions inevitably result in the
extreme views of eternalism or annihilationism, neither of which is
espoused by Buddhism.</p>
<p>Moreover, some people may develop a phobia of extinction. Some may
conclude that Nibbāna equals extinction and give up practising the
Dhamma out of fear. Such reactions and views are extremely unfortunate.
{501}</p>
<p>When someone asks whether things exist or do not exist, if one is not
careful, both answers ’they exist’ and ’they do not exist’ may
potentially cause problems, because such answers may maintain the views
of eternalism and annihilationism. One should not answer categorically;
instead, one should explain that those things people refer to as
existing come into being as a result of causes and conditions. They are
conditioned phenomena (<em>saṅkhāra</em>; <em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>); they exist
temporarily or momentarily, continually arising and passing away. They
arise mutually dependent on one another (<em>paṭicca-samuppanna</em>), in the
form of a stream or a conditioned process.</p>
<p>The Buddha therefore did not answer with a simple affirmative or
negative; he referred to the process of origination. This form of
response aims to dispel our misconceptions of things.</p>
<p>The teachings on <em>anattā</em> function to remove self-concepts fabricated by
craving and wrong view. With the release of attachment, the self or
self-concepts cease automatically. If one comprehends <em>anattā</em> as the
common (i.e. unawakened) belief of ’no self’, however, then one falls
into the wrong view of annihilationism.</p>
<p>In the Suttanipāta the Buddha often characterizes enlightened beings as
having neither <em>attā</em> nor <em>nirattā</em>: having neither ’a self’ nor ’an
absence of self’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn92-1"><a href="#fn-fn92">92</a></sup> They have no thirst for being (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>)
which hankers after a self, nor do they hold a view of existence
(<em>bhava-diṭṭhi</em>), which leads to a view of self (<em>atta-diṭṭhi</em>) or a
view of self-extinction (<em>uccheda-diṭṭhi</em>). Another definition is that
they believe neither in an ’existing self’ nor an ’expired self’: they
avoid the misinterpretation of a fixed self-identity followed by the
belief that the self has vanished. (See
Note <a href="#note-no-doer">No Doer of a Deed</a>.)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">No Doer of a Deed</span><a id="note-no-doer"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note the teaching in the Visuddhimagga:</p>
<p><em>There is no doer of a deed, or one who reaps the deed’s results….
For here there is no Creator God, no Creator of the round of births;
phenomena alone flow on, dependent on the marriage of conditions.</em></p>
<p>This matches the teaching in the Sammohavinodanī:</p>
<p><em>When no being can be found, there is neither substantiality nor
extinction</em></p>
<p><em>Vism. 602-3; VbhA. 194</em></p>
<p>The use of expressions such as ’inflated ego’ and ’destroy the ego’
are simply idioms of speech. They are often used in the context of
intensified levels of clinging to self. It is the clinging which
should be eradicated rather than the self, since no self exists to
eradicate. The thought of eradicating the self is linked to an
annihilationist view. The self is merely a mental concept fabricated
by <em>bhava-taṇhā</em> and superimposed on something which occurs naturally
on its own. The self does not exist independently and therefore has no
inherent reality. Furthermore, the term <em>attavādupādāna</em> suggests
clearly that clinging exists merely to the word (or idea of) ’self’,
since no real self exists to be clung to.</p>

</div>
<p>In conclusion, although the Buddha declared the truth, the truth must
always be linked to practical application. He wished that those who
receive his teachings apply and benefit from them.</p>
<p>The way of explaining <em>anattā</em> by examining the objects a person
identifies with, and by examining people’s relationship to craving,
intends to free the listeners from harmful views and attachments,
enabling them to have a liberated heart and to prosper.</p>
<p>Metaphysical responses, when indulged in, add to confusion and deepen
wrong view. The Buddha therefore remained silent when asked such
metaphysical questions.</p>
<p>Now let us turn to the specific question of whether Nibbāna constitutes
a form of self (<em>attā</em>), or whether Nibbāna is endowed with some form of
substantial essence that could be described as ’self’. {502}</p>
<p>First, all existing phenomena, which can be defined by the terms
<em>dhamma</em> (’thing’), <em>sabhāva</em> (’existing phenomenon’), or
<em>sabhāva-dhamma</em> (’natural phenomenon’), exist according to their own
inherent nature. In respect to conditioned things (<em>saṅkhāra</em>;
<em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>), they exist in line with their causes and conditions.
Nibbāna, on the other hand, is the Unconditioned (<em>visaṅkhāra</em>;
<em>asaṅkhata-dhamma</em>). It also exists according to its own nature and is
endowed with its own inherent attributes, say of purity and
independence, as confirmed many times by the Buddha.</p>
<p>As Nibbāna exists according to its own nature, it is impossible for a
’self’ to interfere with, rule over, control, or dictate it. If a ’self’
– some form of static, ruling essence – were to exist, Nibbāna would
not be able to exist as it does.</p>
<p>Second, some people who discuss these questions about Nibbāna and its
relationship to the self do not understand these terms adequately. They
lack a scholarly clarity within themselves and cause confusion for
others.</p>
<p>Until we ourselves are awakened, we can rely on the words the Buddha
used to describe and explain Nibbāna. As for the term <em>attā</em> (’self’),
one should define it in the context of the traditional philosophical
questions posed by others to the Buddha, rather than create one’s own
definition or rely on ambiguous contemporary definitions of this term.</p>
<p>Some people misunderstand this topic of the self versus selflessness
(<em>anattā</em>), and begin to wonder, for example, whether they themselves
exist or not.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the concept of ’self’ (<em>attā</em>) should be understood as the
belief in ’me’, in the ’I’, in ’him’ and ’her’, etc., as distinct, fixed
entities. In the Pali language, however, the term <em>attā</em> is also used to
refer to the conventional sense of self, as is clearly evident in the
Buddha’s teaching: ’One is one’s own refuge’ (<em>attā hi attano nātho</em>;
literally: ’the self is the refuge of the self.’) Although the teachings
state that in truth there is no abiding, fixed essence or substantial
entity, the conventional designation of a self is valid and useful. In
the discussion of Nibbāna, however, one is examining the true nature of
phenomena, and asking the questions: Does Nibbāna constitute a self? Is
Nibbāna my true self? Is the realization of Nibbāna the attainment of
one’s true self?</p>
<p>Were Nibbāna to be one’s true self, it would have the power to control
and dictate things according to one’s desires. And the only things it
would be able to direct and control are conditioned phenomena or the
five aggregates. Nibbāna would thus pass over the threshold of the
Unconditioned and get caught up in conditioned phenomena. Were this to
be true, Nibbāna would utterly lose its status as the Unconditioned; it
would no longer correspond with Nibbāna as described by the Buddha. It
would no longer be Nibbāna, at least not the Nibbāna of the Buddha.</p>
<p>Third, the claim that Nibbāna is the self is necessarily connected to
grasping and clinging.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn93-1"><a href="#fn-fn93">93</a></sup> For Nibbāna to be self, there must be
grasping (<em>upādāna</em>). Yet this is in conflict with reality, because the
realization of Nibbāna only occurs with the end of grasping (<em>upādāna</em>).
The end of grasping constitutes the realization of Nibbāna. The arahants
who have realized Nibbāna harbour no conception of ’my Nibbāna’, let
alone ’Nibbāna is the self’. The belief in Nibbāna as the self is
completely incompatible with Nibbāna. {503}</p>
<p>Fourth, if Nibbāna were to exist as a separate, supreme self, it would
act as the master and principal agent, controlling and dictating all
things. In this sense it would be similar to Paramātman (’Supreme Self’;
’Primordial Self’), Brahmā, or God, who in theistic religions is claimed
to have created the world, rules over all human beings, and is Lord of
the universe. Yet Nibbāna is a state of purity, happiness, and
independence; it is the Unconditioned (<em>visaṅkhāra</em>); it does not engage
in any way with conditioned things (<em>saṅkhata-dhammā</em>). It pertains to a
completely different matter, to a completely different reality, which
one may describe as diametrically opposed to the conditioned world. It
is thus impossible for Nibbāna to exist as a self.</p>
<p>Fifth, the Buddhist teachings clearly state that the belief in or
attachment to self is a form of mental defilement (<em>kilesa</em>) – a form
of ’grasping’ (<em>upādāna</em>; ’clinging’, ’incorrect adherence’). In this
context the specific term <em>attavādupādāna</em> is used, translated as
’grasping to the belief in self’.</p>
<p>The craving (for the self) to endure and exist eternally – <em>bhavataṇhā</em>
– is the cause for this form of grasping. If this craving manifests by
itself, one has not yet reached the full-blown problem. But if one steps
beyond craving, one arrives at grasping (<em>upādāna</em>), which lies at the
crux of the matter being discussed here.</p>
<p>Note that the specific term for this grasping does not merely refer to a
grasping to the ’self’ (<em>attā</em>), but also includes the term <em>vāda</em>.
Here, there is not grasping to the self, but rather grasping to the
belief in self.</p>
<p>In fact, no self (as a permanent, stable entity) exists. For this
reason, strictly speaking, it is impossible to grasp onto a self, for
essentially no such self exists. The term <em>vāda</em> (’belief’, ’idea’,
’doctrine’, ’assertion’) is added here for the sake of clarity. Any
attachment to the belief in self, including attachment to language
indicating a mistaken identification with self, is a form of mental
impurity.</p>
<p>(Note that in some scriptural passages this grasping is described in a
non-specific, general sense, for example in the statement: ’abandon the
self’. Here, it should be understood that what is meant is ’abandon any
attachment to the belief in self’.)</p>
<p>The grasping to a belief in self (<em>attavādupādāna</em>) is a crucial mental
defilement, listed among the four kinds of grasping (<em>upādāna</em>)
completely relinquished by fully awakened beings (arahants). Those who
are free from any attachment to the belief in self, who do not identify
with anything as a self, are, by definition, arahants. Those who realize
Nibbāna – the fully awakened arahants – do not appropriate anything as
self. Even in regard to Nibbāna itself, they do not consider it to be a
self.</p>
<p>Those who still grasp onto a belief in self, or who still recognize
something to exist as ’self’, are still tainted by defilement; they lack
’true vision’; they have not yet realized Nibbāna, the Unconditioned. No
matter what these people believe to be ’self’, even if it is Nibbāna,
because they have not directly realized Nibbāna, their knowledge and
vision is still confined to the conditioned world. Therefore, whatever
concept of self they create, even if they identify Nibbāna with the
self, is still related and bound to conditioned phenomena; they
still spin around in the realm of the five aggregates. If they claim
that Nibbāna is the self, they are grasping onto a mental image or
concept of Nibbāna, and such concepts are ’mental formations’
(<em>saṅkhāra</em>), which are part of the five aggregates.</p>
<p>To sum up with the Buddha’s words:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>I do not see any doctrine of self that would not arouse sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair in one who clings to it.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn94-1"><a href="#fn-fn94">94</a></sup>
{504}</p>
<p><em>M. I. 137.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3 id="what-happens-after-an-arahants-death"><a class="header" href="#what-happens-after-an-arahants-death">What Happens After an Arahant’s Death?</a></h3>
<p>An inevitable question that arises in the discussion of Nibbāna is:
’What happens to an arahant after death?’ or: ’Does a person who has
realized Nibbāna exist after death or not?’ In truth, this question is
centred around self-view: the devotion to self is acting as a catalyst
in posing the question. This attachment to self or to the label of self
(<em>attavādupādāna</em>) – a doctrine of self – is firmly embedded in the
hearts of unenlightened people, supported by the thirst for being
(<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>) and based on ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>). The Buddha did not
encourage debating this question if one has not eliminated ignorance and
craving. He encouraged knowledge through application rather than
conjecture.</p>
<p>No matter how one responds to these inquiries, the latent root
attachment to self will inevitably lead to a biased understanding. The
questioner will incline towards a wrong view of Nibbāna as either an
enduring self or an eradication of self. It is easy for annihilationists
to view Nibbāna as extinction, because Buddhism emphasizes disentangling
from the widespread belief in eternalism.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn95-1"><a href="#fn-fn95">95</a></sup> As for eternalists, when
their idea of self is invalidated, they search for a substitute to
compensate for the sense of void or to restore the idea of a stable
self. When they encounter a teaching that advocates uprooting the fixed
belief in self, it can seem to them that the self vanishes. They may
then seize Nibbāna as a haven for the self or equate Nibbāna as eternal
life or the Promised Land.</p>
<p>Many esteemed and wise individuals who are free from almost all forms of
attachment get caught up in these views. The escape from this net leads
to complete liberation. The Buddhist teachings admit that such freedom
is extremely difficult to achieve and refer to this subtle attachment to
views as ’the Brahma-ensnaring web’ (<em>brahma-jāla</em>): an entanglement for
the virtuous and wise.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the chapter on the Three Characteristics, an arahant may
be referred to as one who has ’abandoned the self’ (<em>attañjaha</em>). This
expression is used for the sake of convenience, say in poetic verses,
yet it would have been expected that the listener understood this in the
sense of ’abandoning an attachment to the concept of self’. {505}</p>
<p>This is also the case with such expressions as ’boost the ego’,
’self-preservation’, or similar references to self, which are used for
the sake of simplicity. The term ’self’ here should be understood as
’self-image’ or an ’attachment to the concept of self’.</p>
<p>Nibbāna and the practice for Nibbāna have nothing to do with destroying
the self because there is no self to destroy.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn96-1"><a href="#fn-fn96">96</a></sup> It is the attachment
to concepts of self that must be destroyed. One must remove the
attachment to self-assertions, self-views and self-perceptions. Nibbāna
is the end of these misunderstandings and the end of the suffering
caused by attachment. When the yearning for self ceases, all theories of
self automatically lose their significance. When the attachment to self
is uprooted, things will be seen as they truly are; there is no need for
further speculation about self. When the craving and grasping which
gives rise to self ceases, the matter of self vanishes of its own
accord. Nibbāna is the cessation of suffering, not the cessation of
self, since there is no self that ceases. Reflect on the Buddha’s words:
<em>I teach only suffering and the end of suffering</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn97-1"><a href="#fn-fn97">97</a></sup> In order to
shift the emphasis from the preoccupation with Nibbāna and philosophical
debate, the Buddha usually referred to Nibbāna in the context of
practical application or to the related benefits for everyday life, as
demonstrated in passages of the Tipiṭaka.</p>
<p>Rather than give lengthy explanations on the subject of what happens to
arahants after they die, some teachings of the Buddha are included below
for consideration.</p>
<p>This teaching offers a basic understanding on the subject of self,
presenting the two extreme views of eternalism and extinction. It also
elucidates the meaning of <em>bhava-taṇhā</em> and <em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, both devas and humans are subjected to the hold of two
views. Some are bogged down, some overreach, while those with vision
see. And how, monks, are some bogged down?</p>
<p>Devas and humans delight in becoming (bhava), rejoice in becoming,
take pleasure in becoming. When the Dhamma is being taught for the
cessation of becoming (bhava-nirodha), the hearts of those devas and
humans do not leap forward, do not gain confidence, do not become
settled, do not yield. Thus are some bogged down.</p>
<p>And how, monks, do some overreach?</p>
<p>Some devas and humans are afflicted, depressed, and disgusted by
becoming. They delight in non-becoming (vibhava: extinction), saying:
’My good sir, with the breaking up of the body at death, this self is
annihilated, destroyed, and no longer exists. This state is supreme,
excellent and true.’ Thus do some overreach.</p>
<p>And how, monks, do those with vision see?</p>
<p>In this case, a monk sees becoming as becoming.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn98-1"><a href="#fn-fn98">98</a></sup> When he sees
becoming as becoming, he practises for disenchantment (nibbidā),
dispassion (virāga), and cessation (nirodha) in regard to becoming.
Thus do those with vision see. {506}</p>

<p>The Buddha’s repudiation of the view that consciousness leaves the body
and takes a new birth is of particular interest in the study of rebirth.
Although the subject of rebirth is not directly linked to Nibbāna,
examining the teachings on rebirth may add to an understanding of
Nibbāna.</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>On that occasion a wrong view had arisen in a bhikkhu named Sāti, son
of a fisherman, thus: ’As I understand the Dhamma taught by the
Blessed One, it is this same consciousness that runs and wanders
through the round of rebirths, not another….’</p>
<p>The bhikkhus were unable to detach him from that pernicious view, so
they went to the Buddha and told him all that had occurred….</p>
<p>(The Buddha then called the bhikkhu Sāti) and asked him: ’Sāti, is it
true that the following pernicious view has arisen in you: “As I
understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is this same
consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not
another?”</p>
<p>’Exactly so, venerable sir….’</p>
<p>’What is that consciousness, Sāti?’</p>
<p>’Venerable sir, it is that which speaks and feels and experiences here
and there the result of good and bad actions.’</p>
<p>’Misguided man, to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma in
that way? In many discourses have I not stated consciousness to be
dependently arisen, since without a condition there is no origination
of consciousness? But you, misguided man, have misrepresented us by
your wrong grasp and injured yourself and stored up much demerit; for
this will lead to your harm and suffering for a long time.’</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: ’Bhikkhus,
consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent upon
which it arises. When consciousness arises dependent on the eye and
forms, it is reckoned as eye-consciousness; when consciousness arises
dependent on the ear and sounds, it is reckoned as ear-consciousness;
when consciousness arises dependent on the nose and odours, it is
reckoned as nose-consciousness; when consciousness arises dependent on
the tongue and flavours, it is reckoned as tongue-consciousness; when
consciousness arises dependent on the body and tangibles, it is
reckoned as body-consciousness; when consciousness arises dependent on
the mind and mind-objects, it is reckoned as mind-consciousness. Just
as fire is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it
burns … it is reckoned as a log fire … a woodchip fire … a grass
fire … a cowdung fire … a chaff fire … a rubbish fire…. {507}</p>

<p>This teaching corrects the misguided view that arahants are annihilated
after death:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>On one occasion the following wrong view had arisen in a bhikkhu named
Yamaka: ’As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, a
bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with
the breakup of the body and does not exist after death.’</p>
<p>A number of bhikkhus unsuccessfully tried to rid him of this wrong
view. They therefore asked the Ven. Sāriputta for assistance.
Sāriputta approached Yamaka and conducted the following conversation:</p>
<p>’Is it true, friend Yamaka, that such a pernicious view as this has
arisen in you: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One,
a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with
the breakup of the body and does not exist after death”?’</p>
<p>’Exactly so, friend.’</p>
<p>’What do you think, friend Yamaka, is form permanent or impermanent?’</p>
<p>’Impermanent, friend.’</p>
<p>’Is feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness
permanent or impermanent?’</p>
<p>’Impermanent, friend.’</p>
<p>’Therefore, any kind of form … feeling … perception … volitional
formations … consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or
present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior,
far or near … should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom
thus: “This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.” Seeing
thus, [one’s mind] is liberated….</p>
<p>’What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard form as the
Tathāgata?’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn100-1"><a href="#fn-fn100">100</a></sup> ’No, friend.’</p>
<p>’Do you regard feeling … perception … volitional formations …
consciousness as the Tathāgata?’ ’No, friend.’</p>
<p>’What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard the Tathāgata as in
form?’ ’No, friend.’</p>
<p>’Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from form?’ ’No, friend.’</p>
<p>’Do you regard the Tathāgata as in feeling … apart from feeling …
as in perception … apart from perception … as in volitional
formations … as apart from volitional formations … as in
consciousness … as apart from consciousness?’ ’No, friend.’</p>
<p>’What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard form, feeling,
perception, volitional formations and consciousness [taken together]
as the Tathāgata?’ ’No, friend.’</p>
<p>’What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard the Tathāgata as one
who is without form, without feeling, without perception, without
volitional formations, without consciousness?’ {508}</p>
<p>’No, friend.’</p>
<p>’But friend, when the Tathāgata is not apprehended by you as real and
actual here in this very life, is it fitting for you to declare: “As I
understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, a bhikkhu whose
taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of
the body and does not exist after death”?’</p>
<p>’Formerly, friend Sāriputta, when I was ignorant, I did hold that
pernicious view, but now that I have heard this Dhamma teaching of the
Venerable Sāriputta I have abandoned that pernicious view and have
made the breakthrough to the Dhamma.’</p>
<p>’If, friend Yamaka, people were to ask you: “Friend Yamaka, when a
bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, what happens to
him with the breakup of the body, after death?” – being asked thus,
what would you answer?’</p>
<p>’If they were to ask me this, friend, I would answer thus: “Friends,
form is impermanent; what is impermanent is dukkha; what is dukkha has
ceased and passed away. Feeling … perception … volitional
formations … consciousness is impermanent; what is impermanent is
dukkha; what is dukkha has ceased and passed away.” Being asked thus,
friend, I would answer in such a way.’</p>
<p>’Good, good, friend Yamaka.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn101-1"><a href="#fn-fn101">101</a></sup></p>

<p>In this teaching the Buddha, while conversing with the wanderer
Vacchagotta, compares the death of an arahant with the extinguishing of
a fire:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’When a bhikkhu’s mind is liberated thus, Master Gotama, where does he
reappear [after death]?’</p>
<p>’The term “reappears” does not apply,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn102-1"><a href="#fn-fn102">102</a></sup> Vaccha.’</p>
<p>’Then he does not reappear, Master Gotama?’</p>
<p>’The term “does not reappear” does not apply, Vaccha.’</p>
<p>’Then he both reappears and does not reappear, Master Gotama?’</p>
<p>’The term “both reappears and does not reappear” does not apply,
Vaccha.’</p>
<p>’Then he neither reappears nor does not reappear, Master Gotama?’</p>
<p>’The term “neither reappears nor does not reappear” does not apply,
Vaccha.’</p>
<p>’Here I have fallen into bewilderment, Master Gotama, here I have
fallen into confusion, and the measure of confidence I had gained
through previous conversation with Master Gotama has now disappeared.’
{509}</p>
<p>’It is enough to cause you bewilderment, Vaccha, enough to cause you
confusion. For this Dhamma, Vaccha, is profound, hard to see and hard
to understand, peaceful and sublime, unattainable by mere reasoning,
subtle, to be experienced by the wise. It is hard for you to
understand it when you hold another view, accept another teaching,
approve of another teaching, pursue a different training, and follow a
different teacher. So I shall question you about this in return,
Vaccha. Answer as you choose.</p>
<p>’What do you think, Vaccha? Suppose a fire were burning before you.
Would you know: “This fire is burning before me?’ “</p>
<p>’I would, Master Gotama.’</p>
<p>If someone were to ask you, Vaccha: “What does this fire burning
before you burn in dependence on?” – being asked thus, what would you
answer?’</p>
<p>’Being asked thus, Master Gotama, I would answer: “This fire burning
before me burns in dependence on grass and sticks.” ’</p>
<p>’If that fire before you were to be extinguished, would you know:
“This fire before me has been extinguished?” ’</p>
<p>’I would, Master Gotama.’</p>
<p>If someone were to ask you, Vaccha: “When that fire before you was
extinguished, to which direction did it go: to the east, the west, the
north, or the south?” – being asked thus, what would you answer?</p>
<p>’That does not apply, Master Gotama. The fire burned in dependence on
its fuel of grass and sticks. When that is used up, if it does not get
any more fuel, being without fuel, it is reckoned as extinguished.</p>
<p>’So too, Vaccha, the Tathāgata has abandoned that material form …
feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness by
which one describing the Tathāgata might describe him; he has cut it
off at the root, made it like a palm stump, done away with it so that
it is no longer subject to future arising. The Tathāgata is liberated
from reckoning in terms of material form … feelings … perception
… volitional formations … consciousness, Vaccha, he is profound,
immeasurable, unfathomable like the ocean. The term “reappears” does
not apply, the term “does not reappear” does not apply, the term “both
reappears and does not reappear” does not apply, the term “neither
reappears nor does not reappear” does not apply.</p>
<p>Following this conversation faith arose in the wanderer Vacchagotta
and he declared himself a lay follower.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn103-1"><a href="#fn-fn103">103</a></sup> {510}</p>

<p>The Ratana Sutta describes arahants as follows:</p>

<p>At the final passing away (<em>parinibbāna</em>) of Ven. Dabba-Mallaputta, the

Feelings are stilled, volitional formations calmed,<br />
And consciousness has reached its end.</p>

<p>The Buddha recounted the events of this passing away to the monks and
uttered this verse:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Just as the destination of a blazing spark of fire<br />

<p>{420} Some scholars interpret the passages in the
Aṅguttara-Nikāya,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn104-1"><a href="#fn-fn104">104</a></sup> which classify enlightened beings into two
kinds, i.e. <em>sa-upādisesa-puggala</em> (<em>sekha</em> – stream-enterers,
once-returners and non-returners – who are still subject to grasping
and defilement), and <em>anupādisesa-puggala</em> (<em>asekha</em> – arahants – who
are freed from grasping and defilement), by translating <em>upādi</em> as
<em>upādāna</em> (’grasping’), and thus define the two kinds of Nibbāna this
way:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sa-upādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>: Nibbāna with grasping remaining, or
Nibbāna of those with latent defilement, i.e. Nibbāna of
stream-enterers, once-returners, and non-returners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu</em>: Nibbāna with no grasping remaining, or
Nibbāna of those freed from grasping, i.e. Nibbāna of arahants.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Translating this way springs from a confusion between ’states’
(<em>bhava</em>), i.e. <em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em> and <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em>, and
’persons’ (<em>puggala</em>), i.e. <em>sa-upādisesa-puggala</em> and
<em>anupādisesa-puggala</em>. The two kinds of Nibbāna describe the
relationship between Nibbāna and awakened beings. The two persons
describe the attributes of those in contact with Nibbāna. To avoid
confusion these two pairs should be clearly distinguished. The
distinguishing word in this case is <em>upādi</em>, which has a different
meaning when referring to either Nibbāna or to enlightened beings. Note,
however, that some commentarial passages reinforce this misunderstanding
that <em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em> is the Nibbāna of
<em>sa-upādisesa-puggala</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn105-1"><a href="#fn-fn105">105</a></sup></p>
<p>A clear development of the meanings of the two terms
<em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em> and <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em>, stressing an activity
or event, is the establishment of the terms <em>kilesa-parinibbāna</em> and
<em>khandha-parinibbāna</em>. The former corresponds to <em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em>,
while the latter corresponds to <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em>. Despite the
frequent use of these terms in this way, the commentators and
sub-commentators were well aware of the meaning of
<em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em> as denoting the quality of a state, as can be
seen by these examples:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The Buddha abided in the Nibbāna element with remainder, conducting
his life for the benefit of all beings, faring well in this world
until he attained the Nibbāna element without remainder.</p>

Avijjāpaccayāsaṅkhārapadavitthārakathāvaṇṇanā.</em></p>
<p>With the fruit of arahantship, [the arahants] are completely
dispassionate, abiding in the Nibbāna element with remainder, wise,
diligent all day and night. With the end of their final mind, they
attain the Nibbāna element without remainder with their final passing.</p>

<p>As noun forms, <em>diṭṭhadhammika</em> and <em>samparāyika</em> exist as
<em>diṭṭhadhamma</em> and <em>samparāya</em>, respectively. These four words are used
extensively, both in the Pali Canon and in the commentaries, and
generally have the meaning of ’present’ or ’this life’ on the one hand,
and ’future’, ’next life’, or ’next world’, on the other.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn106-1"><a href="#fn-fn106">106</a></sup> The
compounds with <em>attha</em> – <em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em> (’present welfare’) and
<em>samparāyikattha</em> (’future welfare’) – are especially familiar to
scholars. Later, in the commentaries, one occasionally finds
<em>paramattha</em> (’supreme welfare’) included to form a triad.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn107-1"><a href="#fn-fn107">107</a></sup> In the
original scriptures, however, one only finds the pair of
<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em> and <em>samparāyikattha</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn108-1"><a href="#fn-fn108">108</a></sup> In this context
<em>samparāyikattha</em> refers to the welfare that surpasses or transcends
that of <em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>, and includes the definition of
<em>paramattha</em>. <em>Paramattha</em> was originally used on its own as a synonym
for Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn109-1"><a href="#fn-fn109">109</a></sup> In later contexts the definition of <em>samparāyikattha</em>
was narrowed to mean ’future welfare’, ’of the next world’, or
’heavenly’, which was a welfare below the supreme, that is, not yet of
Nibbāna.</p>
<p>An example of <em>samparāyikattha</em> being used in its original context is
the story of the old brahmin Brahmāyu, who visited the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Then the brahmin Brahmāyu thought: ’Permission has been granted me by
the recluse Gotama. Which should I ask him about: good in this life or
the supreme good?’ Then he thought: ’I am skilled in the good of this
life, and others too ask me about good in this life. {421} Why
shouldn’t I ask him only about the supreme good?’ Then he addressed
the Blessed One in stanzas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>’How does one become a brahmin?<br />
And how does one attain to knowledge?<br />
How has one the triple knowledge?<br />
And how does one become a holy scholar?<br />
How does one become an arahant?<br />
And how does one attain completeness?<br />
How is one a silent sage?<br />
And how can one be called a Buddha?’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>M. II. 144.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In its original sense, <em>samparāyika</em> too encompasses the meaning of
<em>paramattha</em>, as seen in the Kaṇṇakatthala Sutta, where King Pasenadi
asks the Buddha about the distinction between members of the four
castes.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn110-1"><a href="#fn-fn110">110</a></sup> The Buddha replied that, concerning the present life,
nobles and brahmins are held to be superior since people pay homage to
them, but concerning a person’s spiritual attainments caste plays no
role; here only the quality of a person’s effort is important. As for
deliverance, the Buddha claimed there is no difference between that
achieved by members of various social classes.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the Mahāniddesa:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>One sees two benefits, mundane and transcendent, from personal
beliefs. What is the mundane benefit stemming from belief? Here,
whatever is the doctrine of the teacher, the disciples share this
doctrine. They honour, respect, worship and hold in awe the teacher of
this doctrine, and as a consequence they receive robes, almsfood,
lodgings and medicine. And what is the transcendent benefit stemming
from belief? Those disciples wish for the future: ’May this doctrine
lead to birth as a nāga, garuḍa … as Indra, Brahma or as a god. This
doctrine is sufficient for purity and deliverance. This view leads to
purity and deliverance.’</p>
<p><em>Nd1. 73-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The commentators tended to restrict the definitions, <em>diṭṭhadhammika</em>
referring to this existence and life, and <em>samparāyika</em> referring to the
next life or world.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn111-1"><a href="#fn-fn111">111</a></sup> Some commentaries on the two elements of
Nibbāna use these same restricted definitions, i.e. <em>diṭṭhadhammika</em>
meaning ’in this life’, and <em>samparāyika</em> meaning ’in the future’ or
’after death’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn112-1"><a href="#fn-fn112">112</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="appendix-3-final-mind"><a class="header" href="#appendix-3-final-mind">Appendix 3: Final Mind</a></h2>
<p><em>Carima-citta</em>, <em>carimaka-citta</em>, <em>carima-viññāṇa</em> and
<em>carimaka-viññāṇa</em> all mean the same thing, that is ’last mind’, ’final
consciousness’, or more explicitly, ’last mind in existence’. It refers
to the passing away (<em>cuti</em>) of an arahant’s mind. Also called
<em>parinibbāna-citta</em>, it is the mind of an arahant at death, or the mind
at the moment of final passing.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn113-1"><a href="#fn-fn113">113</a></sup></p>
<p>The term <em>carima-viññāṇa</em> is first used in the Cūḷaniddesa, a secondary
text of the Tipiṭaka, for example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>At the final passing of an arahant, attaining the Nibbāna element
without remainder, due to the cessation of final consciousness, right
here wisdom and mindfulness, materiality and mentality, also cease;
they are stilled, made tranquil and no longer established.</p>
<p><em>Nd2. 8, explaining Sn. 198-9, and referred to at DhsA. 236.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the commentaries, the terms <em>carima-viññāṇa</em> and <em>carima-citta</em> are
frequently used; they sometimes associate <em>carima-citta</em> with attainment
of the Nibbāna element without remainder. Equally, they associate the
attainment of or initial abiding in <em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em> with the
fruit of arahantship.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn114-1"><a href="#fn-fn114">114</a></sup> Note that in many Thai editions
<em>carima-citta</em> and <em>carima-viññāṇa</em> are printed as <em>purima-citta</em> and
<em>purima-viññāṇa</em> (’preceding mind/consciousness’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn115-1"><a href="#fn-fn115">115</a></sup> Examples of
such inconsistency include canonical texts that use <em>purima</em> and the
explanatory commentarial text that uses <em>carima</em>, or a passage in one
volume using one term and the identical passage in another volume using
the other. The evidence, however, confirms that the correct term is
<em>carima</em>.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-4-attaining-nibbāna"><a class="header" href="#appendix-4-attaining-nibbāna">Appendix 4: ’Attaining’ Nibbāna</a></h2>
<p>{481} I have occasionally used the expression ’attaining Nibbāna’
because it is familiar and easy to understand, although the term that is
more accurate or specific to this context is <em>sacchikiriyā</em> (its verb
form is <em>sacchikaroti</em>; later texts sometimes use <em>sacchikaraṇa</em>), which
literally means ’realization’. The commentaries explain it as ’to
experience or see clearly for oneself’. Although ’attaining Nibbāna’ may
be more convenient, using ’realizing Nibbāna’ probably has less risk of
misunderstanding. ’Attainment’ is closer to the Pali words <em>adhigama</em>
(verb: <em>adhigacchati</em>) and <em>patti</em> (past participle used with Nibbāna:
<em>patta</em>). Both of these words are frequently used with Nibbāna, but in
secondary contexts and usually in verses.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn116-1"><a href="#fn-fn116">116</a></sup></p>
<p>The following words used with Nibbāna are scattered throughout the
scriptures and are mainly used in verse: <em>ārādheti</em> (’attain’,
’accomplish’), <em>phusati</em> (’reach’, ’touch’), <em>gacchati</em> (’arrive at’),
and <em>labhati</em> (’obtain’).</p>
<h2 id="appendix-5-anupāda-parinibbāna"><a class="header" href="#appendix-5-anupāda-parinibbāna">Appendix 5: Anupāda-parinibbāna</a></h2>
<p>MA. II. 155 states that <em>anupādā-parinibbāna</em> equals
<em>appaccaya-parinibbāna</em> (’complete unconditioned Nibbāna’), and the
Majjhima Nikāya Ṭīkā<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn117-1"><a href="#fn-fn117">117</a></sup> states that <em>appaccaya-parinibbāna</em> equals
<em>anupādisesa-parinibbāna</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn118-1"><a href="#fn-fn118">118</a></sup> It follows therefore that
<em>anupādisesa-parinibbāna</em> is identical to both <em>anupādā-parinibbāna</em> and
<em>appaccaya-parinibbāna</em>, i.e. identical to the essential nature of
Nibbāna as discussed earlier in this chapter. DhA. I. 286, ItA. I. 170,
and BvA. 227 substitute the term <em>anupādā-parinibbāna</em> for
<em>anupādisesa-parinibbāna</em>.</p>
<p><em>Anupādā-parinibbāna</em> is an important term denoting Nibbāna; it always
stands on its own and is often used to express the goal of Buddhism,
e.g.:</p>
<p>’Bhikkhu, the Dhamma is taught by me for the sake of final Nibbāna
without fuel’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn119-1"><a href="#fn-fn119">119</a></sup> and: ’It is for the sake of final Nibbāna without
fuel that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn120-1"><a href="#fn-fn120">120</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentaries generally define <em>anupādā-parinibbāna</em> as
<em>appaccaya-parinibbāna</em> – the Unconditioned – i.e. not conditioned by
any ’fuel’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn121-1"><a href="#fn-fn121">121</a></sup> which can be realized in this very life. Some teachers
claim that <em>anupādā-parinibbāna</em> translates as ’final Nibbāna without
clinging (<em>upādāna</em>)’, referring to the fruit of arahantship, but the
commentators reject this opinion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn122-1"><a href="#fn-fn122">122</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, the Vimuttimagga, composed by Upatissa before Buddhaghosa
composed the Visuddhimagga, explains <em>nissaraṇa-vimutti</em> as
<em>anupādisesa-parinibbāna</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn123-1"><a href="#fn-fn123">123</a></sup> Interestingly, this opinion conforms to
the meaning expressed above. See the following discussion on
deliverance.</p>

<p>The Thai translated edition renders the phrase ’the one
liberation is the same as the other’ as ’they are both liberated by
deliverance’, since the Thai Pali edition reads: <em>yadidaṁ vimuttiyā
vimuttanti</em>. The Burmese and Roman editions read: <em>yadidaṁ vimuttiyā
vimuttinti</em>. The phrase also occurs at A. III. 34, for which the
Thai edition translates it differently. The commentaries (SA. III.
292 and AA. III. 244 explain ’vimutti’ as <em>arahattaphala-vimutti</em>.
The scriptures from around the first century B.C. onwards, for
example the Milindapañhā (Miln.: Book IV, Chaṭṭhavaggo, no. 3,
Gihī-arahattapañho, dilemma 62), assert that a layperson realizing
arahantship must take higher ordination (<em>upasampadā</em>) on that very
day or else attain <em>parinibbāna</em>. On the question of why an
enlightened householder would take ordination, see Miln: Book IV,
Chaṭṭhavaggo, no. 9, Gihipabbajitasammāpaṭipattipañho (dilemma 54). <a href="#fr-fn82-1">↩</a></p>

<p><em>Yathābhūta-ñāṇadassana</em> is knowledge of the severance point
(i.e. at <em>upādāna</em>), but it is not yet the final knowledge of
<em>vimutti-ñāṇadassana</em>; it is natural that <em>nibbidā</em> follows the
arising of <em>yathābhūta-ñāṇadassana</em> (see: A. V. 3, 313); see the
Buddha’s teaching that with the fading of ignorance, knowledge
arises and clinging ceases: M. I. 67; for how much knowledge is

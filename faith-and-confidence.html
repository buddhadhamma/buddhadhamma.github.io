<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The meaning, role, and importance of faith (<em>saddhā</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> in the
Buddhist teachings is as follows:</p>
<p>Faith here does not mean handing over complete responsibility to
something or someone without applying reasoned judgement. On the
contrary; to do that would be an expression of emotional immaturity.</p>
<p>Faith is merely one stage – and the first stage – in the development
of wisdom. Correct faith is connected to reasoned analysis: it must lead
to and be validated by wisdom. It is the opposite to handing over
complete responsibility or to a total entrusting oneself to something or
someone else without applying reasoned judgement, which is an expression
of simple emotionality (<em>āvega</em>) and leads people to stop making
inquiries. Faith based simply on emotion is a form of gullibility; it
should be amended and ultimately eliminated. Granted, the emotion
stemming from a correct kind of faith can prove useful at early stages
of Dhamma practice, but in the end it is replaced by wisdom.</p>
<p>The faith included in wisdom development is perhaps better defined as
self-confidence: a person has a strong conviction based on critical
reasoning that the aspired-to goal or ideal is both valuable and
attainable. This faith inspires a person to validate the truth which he
or she believes to be reasonably accessible.</p>
<p>To help define faith in a correct manner, all teachings in the Pali
Canon containing <em>saddhā</em> in a group of spiritual factors also contain
wisdom as an accompanying factor, and normally, faith is listed as the
first factor while wisdom is listed as the final factor (see
Note <a href="#note-factors-faith">Factors Starting With Faith</a>). Teachings emphasizing wisdom, however,
do not need to include the factor of faith (see
Note <a href="#note-factors-without-faith">Factors Not Including Faith</a>). {588}</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Factors Starting With Faith</span><a id="note-factors-faith"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are many examples, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtues conducive to future benefits (<em>samparāyikattha</em>): faith,
moral conduct, generosity, and wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtues conducive to growth (<em>vuḍḍhi-dhamma</em>): faith, moral
conduct, learning, generosity, and wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spiritual powers/faculties (<em>bala</em>/<em>indriya</em>): faith, energy,
mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualities making for intrepidity (<em>vesārajjakaraṇa-dhamma</em>):
faith, moral conduct, great learning, application of energy, and
wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noble treasures (<em>ariya-dhana</em>): faith, moral conduct, moral
shame, fear of wrongdoing, great learning, generosity, and wisdom.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Factors Not Including Faith</span><a id="note-factors-without-faith"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Virtues to be established in the mind (<em>adhiṭṭhāna-dhamma</em>):
wisdom, truthfulness, generosity, and serenity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Factors of enlightenment (<em>bojjhaṅga</em>): mindfulness, investigation
of truth, energy, rapture, tranquillity, concentration, and
equanimity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Qualities which make for protection (<em>nāthakaraṇa-dhamma</em>): moral
conduct, great learning, association with virtuous people,
amenability to correction, willingness to give a helping hand,
love of truth, application of energy, contentment, mindfulness,
and wisdom.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Because wisdom governs other virtues and is an essential factor, it is
more important than faith. Even as a personal attribute, wisdom rather
than faith is the decisive factor: those individuals who are most highly
praised in Buddhism, like the chief disciple Ven. Sāriputta, are those
who possess the greatest wisdom.</p>
<p>There are two distinct benefits to faith:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>faith conditions rapture (<em>pīti</em>), which gives rise to tranquillity
(<em>passaddhi</em>), which in turn leads to happiness, then concentration,
and finally to wisdom; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>faith generates effort – the endeavour to undertake spiritual
practice and to put to the test those things believed in by faith,
in order to witness the truth for oneself, which eventually leads to
wisdom. (See
Note <a href="#note-faith-supporting">Faith as a Supporting Condition</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these two benefits stem from an emotional basis, the process
leading to their culmination must always contain an inherent aspiration
for wisdom.</p>
<p>As the purpose of true faith is to support wisdom, faith must promote
critical discernment, which leads to wisdom development. And faith
itself is well-grounded and secure only when a person has established
confidence and dispelled doubts through rational inquiry and
understanding. In Buddha-Dhamma, the quality of faith thus supports
inquiry and investigation. The methods of appealing to others to
believe, forcing others to accept a prescribed truth, or threatening
disbelievers with punishment are all incompatible with this Buddhist
principle of faith.</p>
<p>Faith and devotion to another person has drawbacks. The Buddha even
encouraged his disciples to abandon devotion to himself, because such
devotion is heavily invested with emotion and can become an obstacle to
complete and perfect liberation.</p>
<p>Faith is not classified as a factor of the Path, because it is wisdom,
guiding and validating faith, that is the necessary factor for
progressing on the Path. Furthermore, those persons with great wisdom,
for example the perfectly enlightened Buddhas and the Pacceka-Buddhas,
begin the Path at wisdom, without passing through the stage of faith.
The cultivation of wisdom need not always begin with faith – it may
also begin with wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>). Therefore, the
Buddha inserted the concept of faith in the section on developing right
view; he did not distinguish faith as a separate factor.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Faith as a Supporting Condition</span><a id="note-faith-supporting"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faith leading to rapture (<em>pīti</em>), see: S. II. 31; faith leading to
energy (<em>viriya</em>), see: S. V. 225. Faith helps to generate mental
strength and fearlessness, which are attributes of ’energy’
(<em>viriya</em>): see the Dhajagga Sutta (S. I. 218-20).</p>
<p>Note that faith unsupported by wisdom is a force leading to
concentration, including the extremely high levels of concentration
which are forms of mental liberation (<em>cetovimutti</em>). These states of
mind, however, are still subject to vacillation and stagnation: they
do not necessarily lead to wisdom and may even obstruct wisdom. Faith
accompanied by wisdom, on the other hand, generates concentration that
supports the further development of wisdom. In the final stage, faith
and concentration lead to liberation by wisdom (<em>paññā-vimutti</em>),
which makes for an unshakeable liberation of mind.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Even faith that passes beyond what is called ’blind faith’ is still
considered incorrect if it does not reach the stage of inquiry and of
aiming for clear vision, because it fails to fulfil its function.
Spiritual practice stuck at this level is still defective, because it
lacks a true objective.</p>
<p>Although faith is of significant benefit, at the final stages it must
come to an end. The existence of faith indicates that the true goal has
not yet been reached, because as long as one ’believes’ in that goal, it
shows that one has not yet realized it for oneself. As long as faith
exists, it reveals that a person still depends on external things,
entrusts wisdom to external things, and has not reached perfect freedom.
{589}</p>
<p>Faith is therefore not an attribute of an arahant; on the contrary, an
arahant has the attribute of being ’faithless’ (<em>asaddha</em>), which means
that he or she has directly realized the truth and no longer needs to
believe in another person or in a rational explanation for the truth.</p>
<p>To sum up, progression on the Path is gradual, beginning with faith
(<em>saddhā</em>), developing into a seeing or understanding in line with cause
and effect (<em>diṭṭhi</em>), and finally leading to a knowledge and vision of
the truth (<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>). At the final stage, the task of faith is
ended.</p>
<p>The importance and advantages of faith should be clearly understood. One
should neither give faith too much value nor hold it in contempt, both
of which have harmful consequences. A disparagement of faith reveals a
misunderstanding of faith’s role. A person may possess a high degree of
self-confidence, for example, but this may simply be a belief in one’s
own mental defilements and manifest as conceit and egoism.</p>
<p>In relation to moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>), faith is a vital factor. It
provides people with supportive principles that act as deterrents,
enabling them to resist temptations and provocations and to abstain from
performing bad actions.</p>
<p>Faith also provides a channel for thought. When people experience a
sense impression that does not overwhelm the mind (does not exceed the
power of the principles instilled by faith), the course of their
thinking follows the path prepared by faith; thoughts do not stray in
unwholesome directions. For people who are still subject to mental
defilements, faith thus sustains virtuous conduct.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Although faith has many benefits, if it is not accompanied by wisdom
then it can be harmful and it can even hinder the development of wisdom.</p>
<p>In reference to wisdom development, it is possible to give a rough
outline of the various stages of faith (before one reaches a
consummation of wisdom), as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One develops views based on sound reason; one does not believe in
things simply because one has been told by others (in accord with
the Kālāma Sutta – see below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One safeguards truthfulness (<em>saccānurakkha</em>); one listens to the
teachings, opinions, and doctrines of various parties with
objectivity; one does not rush into making judgements about things
that one does not yet truly know; one does not stubbornly insist
that one’s personal knowledge and opinions represent the truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one has listened to the teachings and opinions of others, has
seen that they accord with reason, and has observed that the person
who offers these teachings is sincere, unbiased, and wise,
confidence arises. One accepts the teachings in order to continue an
examination of the truth using reasoned analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One contemplates and examines these teachings until one is convinced
that they are true and correct; one feels deeply impressed by the
truth that one has witnessed and makes effort to further one’s
investigations in order to deepen a realization of the truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one has doubts one hastens to inquire from others with a sincere
heart; one inquires not to shore up one’s identity but in order to
gain wisdom. Faith is consolidated by proving the truth of reasoned
arguments. In this way the purpose of faith is fulfilled. {590}</p>

<h2 id="the-buddhas-words-on-faith"><a class="header" href="#the-buddhas-words-on-faith">The Buddha’s Words on Faith</a></h2>
<p>The Kālāma Sutta offers a principle for establishing a viewpoint founded
on reasoned analysis for all people, regardless of whether they already
hold to a particular theory, teaching, or doctrine:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>At one time the Buddha was wandering and arrived at the township of
Kesaputta in the Kosala country which was the residence of the Kālāma
clan. Having heard a good report of the Buddha, the Kālāmas approached
him, exchanged greetings, and told him the following:</p>
<p>There are, Lord, some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesaputta.
They explain and elevate their own doctrines, but ridicule, disparage,
revile, and vilify the doctrines of others. But then other ascetics
and brahmins come to Kesaputta, and they too explain and elevate their
own doctrines, but ridicule, disparage, revile, and vilify the
doctrines of others. For us, Lord, there is perplexity and doubt as to
which of these ascetics and brahmins speak truth and which speak
falsehood.</p>
<p>[The Buddha replied:]</p>
<p>It is fitting for you to be perplexed, O Kālāmas, it is fitting for
you to be in doubt. Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter.
Come, Kālāmas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not believe on the basis of holding to oral tradition<br />
(<em>anussava</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-anussava">The Term ’Anussava’</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not believe on the basis of holding to a lineage of teaching
(<em>paramparā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not believe on the basis of hearsay (<em>itikirā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not believe on the basis of referring to scriptures
(<em>piṭaka-sampadāna</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not believe on the basis of logical reasoning (<em>takka</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not believe on the basis of inferential reasoning (<em>naya</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not believe on the basis of rational reflection
(<em>ākāra-parivitakka</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not believe because a teaching accords with personal opinions
(<em>diṭṭhi-nijjhānakkhanti</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not believe because of a speaker’s inspiring appearance
(<em>bhabba-rūpatā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not believe because you think: ’This ascetic is our teacher’
(<em>samaṇo no garūti</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But when you know for yourselves, ’These things are unwholesome, these
things are harmful, these things are censured by the wise, these
things, if undertaken and practised, lead to detriment and suffering’,
then you should abandon them…. When you know for yourselves, ’These
things are wholesome, these things are harmless, these things are
praised by the wise, these things, if undertaken and practised, lead
to wellbeing and happiness’, then you should engage in them. {591}</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the case that people lacked an understanding of and a belief in a
particular subject matter, the Buddha did not urge them to believe.
Instead, he encouraged them to consider and judge the matter according
to the causes and effects that they were able to witness for themselves.
In reference to the subject of rebirth, for example, there is a passage
at the end of the aforementioned sutta, which states:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>When, Kālāmas, this noble disciple has thus made his mind free of
enmity, free of ill-will, uncorrupted and pure, he has won four
assurances in this very life.</p>
<p>The first assurance he has won is this: ’If there is another world
(paraloka), and if good and bad deeds bear fruit and yield results, it
follows that with the breakup of the body, after death, I shall arise
in a good destination, in a heavenly world.’</p>
<p>The second assurance he has won is this: ’If there is no other world,
and if good and bad deeds do not bear fruit and yield results, still
right here, in this very life, I live happily, free of enmity and
ill-will.’</p>
<p>The third assurance he has won is this: ’Suppose evil befalls the
evil-doer. Then, as I do not intend evil for anyone, how can suffering
afflict me, one who does no evil deed?’</p>
<p>The fourth assurance he has won is this: ’Suppose evil does not befall
the evil-doer. Then right here I see myself purified in both
respects.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>

<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">The Term ’Anussava’</span><a id="note-anussava"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since the initial writing stage of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> (before the
first edition was printed), I have felt that the phrase here ’do not
believe’ does not clearly convey the meaning of the Pali, but I have
not yet found an adequate replacement. [Trans.: the author here is
referring to the Thai phrase <em>yah yeut theu</em> (อย่ายึดถือ); this can
also mean ’do not grasp’, ’do not assume’.] I based my translation on
the version of the Thai Tipiṭaka: A Tribute to 25 Centuries of
Buddhism (published in 2500 BE), which applies the commentarial
interpretation of <em>mā</em> in this context as <em>mā gaṇhittha</em>. In later
editions of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> I continued to use the phrase <em>yah yeut
theu</em>, but added the footnote: ’the term “do not believe” here is an
interim phrase, as no adequate substitute has been found. Understand
this phrase to mean “do not make a judgement or establish an opinion
in an absolute, categorical way based on any of these factors alone”.’
In 1972, when I compiled the ’Dictionary of Buddhism’
(พจนานุกรมพุทธศาสน์ ฉบับประมวลธรรม), I settled with the translation
’do not (decisively) believe’ (<em>yah bplong jy cheua</em> –
อย่าปลงใจเชื่อ). Later editions of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> retained the
original translation, with the added footnote: ’the expression <em>yah
yeut theu</em> should be understood as corresponding to <em>yah bplong jy
cheua</em>.’ For more on this subject, see Appendix 1.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In regard to people who did not follow a specific doctrine or religion,
the Buddha would teach with kindness and in a neutral, objective manner.
He would encourage the listener to contemplate the truth from an
independent standpoint. He would not claim ownership of these teachings
nor would he try and persuade people to show devotion to himself or to
convert to ’Buddhism’.</p>
<p>The Buddha did not refer to himself or to a supernatural power as proof
of the authenticity of his teachings, but rather he referred to the ’way
things are’ and to the facts that people are able to see for themselves
through their own wisdom. Moreover, the Buddha taught the basic
principle of practice called the principle of ’certainty’
(<em>apaṇṇakatā</em>): in regard to those matters of which general people lack
an understanding, whether this be those things referred to as
supernatural or even common phenomena which are not clearly understood,
one should choose a definite and certain course of action, rather than
get caught up in speculation.</p>
<p>A famous example of this principle is found in the Apaṇṇaka Jātaka. Two
separate caravans both needed to carry a heavy load of water in order to
cross a desert. The first caravan encountered a goblin, transformed in
the likeness of a man, who wished to deceive and devour them. Using
phoney evidence, he told the members of the caravan that just ahead they
would find an area abounding with pools and lakes. He thus told them to
throw out all of their water, rather than carry it unnecessarily. The
members of the caravan were delighted and poured out all of the water
from their jars. But they found no water up ahead, grew weak, and were
devoured by demons.</p>
<p>The members of the second caravan were similarly shown the spurious
evidence of water, but they applied the ’principle of certainty’,
reflecting: ’As long as we have not seen the truth of this matter
firsthand, we shall not simply follow this logic or conjecture. What we
know for certain is the water we are now carrying in our oxcarts. When
we meet this alleged water source ahead, we can fill up our jars.’ By
applying wisdom and relying on that which is directly discernible, this
caravan was able to reach safety.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> {592}</p>
<p>This principle of choosing a definite and certain course of action may
also be applied to Dhamma practice and in regard to subtle aspects of
the mind (<em>nāma-dhamma</em>), as described in the Apaṇṇaka Sutta:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>At one time the Buddha arrived at the brahmin village of Sālā. Having
heard a good report of the Buddha, the brahmin householders approached
him and exchanged greetings. The Buddha asked them the following:</p>
<p>’Householders, is there any teacher agreeable to you in whom you have
acquired faith supported by reasoned discernment
(<em>ākāravatī-saddhā</em>)?’</p>
<p>’No, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>’Since, householders, you have not found an agreeable teacher, you may
undertake and practise this infallible and certain teaching
(apaṇṇaka-dhamma); for when this infallible and certain teaching is
correctly undertaken it will lead to your welfare and happiness for a
long time. And what is this infallible and certain teaching?</p>
<p>’Householders, there are some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and
view is this: “Gifts bear no fruit, offerings bear no fruit, sacrifice
bears no fruit; no fruit or result of good and bad actions; no this
world, no other world;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> no mother, no father….” Now there are
some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine is directly opposed to that
of those recluses and brahmins, and they say thus: “Gifts, offerings,
and sacrifices bear fruit; there is fruit and result of good and bad
actions….” What do you think, householders? Don’t these recluses and
brahmins hold doctrines directly opposed to each other?’</p>
<p>’Yes, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>’Now, householders, of those recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and
view is this: “Gifts bear no fruit, offerings bear no fruit,
sacrifices bear no fruit…” it is to be expected that they will
forsake these three wholesome states, namely, good bodily conduct,
good verbal conduct, and good mental conduct, and that they will
undertake and practise these three unwholesome states, namely, bodily
misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct. Why is that?
Because those recluses and brahmins do not see the danger,
degradation, and defilement in unwholesome states, nor do they see in
wholesome states the aspect of purity – the blessing of
renunciation….</p>
<p>’About this a wise man considers thus: “If there is no other world,
then on the dissolution of the body this person will have made himself
safe enough. But if there is another world, then on the dissolution of
the body, after death, he will reappear in a state of deprivation, in
an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. Now whether or not
the word of those recluses and brahmins is true, let me assume that
there is no other world: still this person is here and now censured by
the wise as an immoral person, one of wrong view who holds the
doctrine of nihilism. But on the other hand, if there is another
world, then this person has lost on both counts: since he is censured
by the wise here and now, and since on the dissolution of the body,
after death, he will reappear in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy
destination, in perdition, even in hell….” ’</p>
<p>’Householders, there are some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and
view is this: “There is no final cessation of being.”<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> Now there
are some recluses and brahmins whose doctrine is directly opposed to
that of those recluses and brahmins, and they say thus: “There is a
final cessation of being….” {593}</p>
<p>About this a wise man considers thus: “These recluses and brahmins
hold the doctrine and view ’there is no final cessation of being’, but
that has not been seen by me. And these other recluses and brahmins
hold the doctrine and view ’there is a final cessation of being’, but
that has not been known by me. If, without knowing and seeing, I were
to take one side and declare: ’Only this is true, anything else is
wrong’, that would not be fitting for me.</p>
<p>Now as to the recluses and brahmins who hold the doctrine and view
’there is no final cessation of being’, if their word is true, then it
is certainly still possible that I might reappear [after death]
among the gods of the immaterial realms who consist of perception.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup>
But as to the recluses and brahmins who hold the doctrine and view
’there is a final cessation of being’, if their word is true then it
is possible that I might here and now attain final Nibbāna.</p>
<p>However, the view of those recluses and brahmins who hold the doctrine
and view ’there is no final cessation of being’ is close to
attachment, close to bondage, close to indulgence, close to
infatuation, close to clinging; but the view of those recluses and
brahmins who hold the doctrine and view ’there is final cessation of
being’ is close to non-attachment, close to non-bondage, close to
non-indulgence, close to non-infatuation, close to non-clinging.“
After reflecting thus, he practises the way to disenchantment and
dispassion towards being, to the true cessation of being.’</p>
<p><em>M. I. 400-413.</em></p>

</div>
<p>The following teaching by the Buddha reveals how knowledge still based
on faith and logic remains faulty, still prone to error, and not a true
realization of the truth:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>There are five things, Bhāradvāja, that may turn out in two different
ways here and now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Faith (<em>saddhā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approval (<em>ruci</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oral tradition (<em>anussava</em>; transmitted knowledge).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reasoned thinking (<em>ākāra-parivitakka</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conformity to personal views (<em>diṭṭhi-nijjhānakkhanti</em>; this
includes the act of reflection).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now something may be fully accepted out of faith, yet it may be empty
and false; but something else may not be fully accepted out of faith,
yet it may be factual, true, and unfailing.</p>
<p>Again, something may be fully approved of and agreeable, yet it may be
empty and false; but something else may not be fully approved of and
agreeable, yet it may be factual, true, and unfailing.</p>
<p>Again, something may be passed down by tradition, yet it may be empty
and false; but something else may not be passed down by tradition, yet
it may be factual, true, and unfailing.</p>
<p>Again, something may be well thought over, yet it may be empty and
false; but something else may not resemble that which has been thought
over, yet it may be factual, true, and unfailing.</p>
<p>Again, something may be well reflected upon [as conforming to
personal views and beliefs], yet it may be empty and false; but
something else may not resemble that which has been reflected upon,
yet it may be factual, true, and unfailing. {594}</p>
<p><em>M. II. 170-71; cf.: M. II. 218.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the following sutta the Buddha goes on to reveal a way of protecting
or safeguarding the truth (<em>saccānurakkha</em>) – the means to conduct
oneself in relation to personal views and beliefs and the way to respond
to the views and beliefs of others:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>It is not proper for a wise man who protects truth to come to the
definite conclusion: ’Only this is true, anything else is wrong.’</p>
<p>If a person has faith, he protects truth when he says: ’My faith is
thus’; but he does not yet come to the definite conclusion: ’Only this
is true, everything else is false.’ In this way, there is the
protection of truth; in this way he protects truth; in this way we
describe the protection of truth. But as yet there is no realization
of truth.</p>
<p>If a person approves of something … if he has received a
transmission of knowledge … if he applies reasoned thinking … if
he gains a reflective acceptance of a personal view, he protects truth
when he says: ’I have an agreeable view thus’ … ’I have received a
transmission thus’ … ’I have considered with reason thus’ … ’my
reflective acceptance of a view is thus’: but he does not yet come to
the definite conclusion: ’Only this is true, everything else is
false.’ In this way, there is the protection of truth; in this way he
protects truth; in this way we describe the protection of truth. But
as yet there is no realization of truth.</p>
<p><em>M. II. 171.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha clarifies this proper conduct in another sutta. On one
occasion the monks were discussing other people’s praise and criticism
of the Buddhist teachings, and the Buddha explained thus:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’Monks, if anyone should speak in disparagement of me, of the Dhamma,
or of the Sangha, you should not be angry, resentful or upset on that
account. If you were to be angry or displeased at such disparagement,
that would only be a danger to you. If others disparage me, the
Dhamma, or the Sangha, and you are angry or displeased, can you
recognize whether what they say is right or not?’</p>
<p>’No, Lord.’</p>
<p>’If others falsely disparage me, the Dhamma, or the Sangha, then you
must explain what is incorrect, saying: “For this reason that is
incorrect, for this reason that is false, that is not our way, that is
not found among us.”</p>
<p>’Monks, if others should speak in praise of me, of the Dhamma, or of
the Sangha, you should not on that account be pleased, happy or
elated. If you were to be pleased or elated at such praise, that would
only be a danger to you. If others rightly praise me, the Dhamma, or
the Sangha, you should acknowledge what is true, saying: “For this
reason that is correct, for this reason that is right, that is our
way, that is found among us.” ’ {595}</p>
<p><em>D. I. 2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the previous sutta on safeguarding the truth (<em>saccānurakkha</em>), the
Buddha goes on to describe the way of practice for realizing the truth
(<em>saccānubodhi</em>) and for arriving at the truth (<em>saccānupatti</em>), which
includes the arising of faith. This description explains both the
importance and the limitations of faith:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’But in what way, Master Gotama, is there the realization of truth? In
what way is a person known as one who has realized the truth?’</p>
<p>’Here, a monk may be living in dependence on some village or town.
Then a householder or a householder’s son goes to him and examines him
in regard to three kinds of states: in regard to states based on
greed, in regard to states based on hate, and in regard to states
based on delusion: “Are there in this venerable one any states based
on greed such that, with his mind obsessed by those states, while not
knowing he might say, ’I know’, or while not seeing he might say, ’I
see’, or he might urge others to act in a way that would lead to their
harm and suffering for a long time?”</p>
<p>’As he examines him he comes to know: “There are no such states in
this venerable one based on greed such that, with his mind obsessed by
those states, while not knowing he might say, ’I know’, or while not
seeing he might say, ’I see’, or he might urge others to act in an
unprofitable way that would lead to their harm and suffering for a
long time. Moreover, the bodily behaviour and the verbal behaviour of
this venerable one are not those of one affected by greed. And the
Dhamma that this venerable one teaches is profound, hard to see and
hard to penetrate, peaceful and sublime, unattainable by mere
reasoning, subtle, to be experienced by the wise. This Dhamma cannot
easily be taught by one affected by greed.”</p>
<p>’When he has examined him and has seen that he is purified from states
based on greed, he next examines him in regard to states based on hate
… in regard to states based on delusion….</p>
<p>’When he has examined him and has seen that he is purified from states
based on delusion, then he places faith in him. Filled with faith he
visits him and associates with him; having approached him, he gives
ear; when he gives ear, he hears the Dhamma; having heard the Dhamma,
he memorizes it and examines the meaning of the teachings he has
memorized; when he examines their meaning, he gains an acceptance of
those teachings based on his investigations; when he has gained a
reflective acceptance of those teachings, enthusiasm springs up; when
enthusiasm has sprung up, he has determination; having determination,
he scrutinizes; having scrutinized, he strives; resolutely striving,
he realizes within himself the ultimate truth and sees it by
penetrating it with wisdom. In this way, there is the realization of
truth; in this way one realizes truth; in this way we describe the
awakening to truth (saccānubodha). But as yet there is no final
arrival at truth.’</p>
<p>’But in what way is there the final arrival of truth? In what way does
one finally arrive at truth?’</p>
<p>’The final arrival of truth (saccānupatti) lies in the repetition,
development, and cultivation of those same things. In this way there
is the final arrival at truth; in this way one finally arrives at
truth.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> {596}</p>
<p><em>M. II. 171-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Faith is vital for initial stages of spiritual practice. It is conducive
to spiritual growth and when applied correctly it accelerates spiritual
development.</p>
<p>For this reason, a person with superior wisdom but who lacks strong
faith may attain to a spiritual goal slower than someone who has
inferior wisdom but has ardent faith.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> When faith is placed on a
righteous object, a person saves both time and labour, but when faith is
placed on something unrighteous, it misleads and hinders a person.</p>
<p>In any case, faith as taught in Buddha-Dhamma is based on reasoned
analysis and guided by wisdom, which prevents faith from being
misplaced. If faith does go astray, it can be corrected because it is
not a blind attachment; one is encouraged to continually examine the
justification and validity of faith.</p>
<p>A lack of faith is an obstacle, which can interrupt and delay spiritual
development, as confirmed by the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, for a monk who has not been able to remove five stakes in
the heart, has not been able to release five mental bonds, it is
impossible that he should reach complete growth in this Dhamma and
Vinaya. The five stakes in the heart a monk is not yet able to abandon
are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A monk has doubts and hesitations about the Teacher; he is
indecisive and uncommitted in regard to the Teacher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A monk has doubts and hesitations about the Dhamma; he is
indecisive and uncommitted in regard to the Dhamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A monk has doubts and hesitations about the Sangha; he is
indecisive and uncommitted in regard to the Sangha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A monk has doubts and hesitations about the training; he is
indecisive and uncommitted in regard to the training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A monk is angry and resentful with his companions in the holy
life; he feels hostile and callous towards them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The mind of a monk who is doubtful, hesitant, indecisive and
uncommitted in regard to the Teacher … the Dhamma … the Sangha …
the training … who is angry with his companions in the holy life …
is not inclined towards effort, diligent practice, persistence, and
endeavour. A monk who is not inclined towards effort … is one who
has not yet removed the stakes in the heart….<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup></p>
<p><em>D. III. 238; M. I. 101.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A lack of faith and confidence, i.e. doubt and hesitation, are major
obstacles for the development of wisdom and spiritual progress. In this
case the required task is to dispel doubts and to establish faith.</p>
<p>The establishment of faith here, however, is not an acceptance of
something or someone, or an entrusting oneself to something or someone,
without honouring one’s own wisdom. Rather, a person should examine the
situation with wisdom in order to clearly see the causal relationships
between things; this will lead to confidence and an end of doubt.</p>
<p>In the following sutta, the Buddha describes this wise inquiry, and in
this teaching the Buddha encourages people to investigate the validity
of the Buddha himself: {597}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, a monk who is an inquirer, not knowing how to read another’s
mind, should make an investigation of the Tathāgata in order to find
out whether or not he is fully enlightened…. A monk who is an
inquirer, not knowing how to read another’s mind, should investigate
the Tathāgata with respect to two kinds of states, states cognizable
through the eye and through the ear, thus:</p>
<p>’Are there found in the Tathāgata any defiled states cognizable
through the eye or through the ear?’ When he investigates him, he
comes to know: ’No defiled states cognizable through the eye or
through the ear are found in the Tathāgata.’</p>
<p>When he comes to know this, he investigates him further: ’Are there
found in the Tathāgata any mixed states (sometimes pure, sometimes
impure) cognizable through the eye or through the ear?’ When he
investigates him, he comes to know: ’No mixed states cognizable
through the eye or through the ear are found in the Tathāgata.’</p>
<p>When he comes to know this, he investigates him further: ’Are there
found in the Tathāgata cleansed states cognizable through the eye or
through the ear?’ When he investigates him, he comes to know:
’Cleansed states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are
found in the Tathāgata.’</p>
<p>When he comes to know this, he investigates him further: ’Has this
venerable one attained this wholesome state over a long time or did he
attain it recently?’ When he investigates him, he comes to know: ’This
venerable one has attained this wholesome state over a long time; he
did not attain it only recently.’</p>
<p>When he comes to know this, he investigates him further: ’Are there
found in this venerable one, who has acquired renown and attained
fame, dangers [connected with renown and fame]?’ Because for
[some] monks the dangers [connected with renown and fame] are not
found in them as long as they have not acquired renown and attained
fame; but when they have acquired renown and attained fame, those
dangers are found in them. When he investigates him, he comes to know:
’This venerable one has acquired renown and attained fame, but the
dangers [connected with renown and fame] are not found in him.’</p>
<p>When he comes to know this, he investigates him further thus: ’Does
this venerable refrain [from evil] without fear, not refraining from
evil by fear, and does he avoid indulging in sensual pleasures because
he is without lust through the destruction of lust?’ When he
investigates him, he comes to know: ’This venerable refrains [from
evil] without fear, not refraining from evil by fear, and he avoids
indulging in sensual pleasures because he is without lust through the
destruction of lust.’</p>
<p>Now if others should ask that monk thus: ’What are your reasons
(ākāra) and what is your evidence (anvaya) whereby you say: ’This
venerable refrains [from evil] without fear, not refraining from
evil by fear, and he avoids indulging in sensual pleasures because he
is without lust through the destruction of lust’? – answering
rightly, that monk would answer thus: ’Whether that venerable one
dwells in a group of people or alone, while some there are
well-behaved and some are ill-behaved and some there lead a community,
while some there are worried about material things and some are
unsullied by material things, still that venerable one does not
despise anyone because of that. And I have heard and learned this from
the Blessed One’s own lips: ’I refrain [from evil] without fear, not
refraining from evil by fear, and I avoid indulging in sensual
pleasures because I am without lust through the destruction of lust.’</p>
<p>The Tathāgata, monks, should be questioned further about that thus:
’Are there found in the Tathāgata or not any defiled states cognizable
through the eye or through the ear?’ The Tathāgata would answer thus:
’No defiled states cognizable through the eye or through the ear are
found in the Tathāgata.’ {598}</p>
<p>If asked, ’Are there found in the Tathāgata or not any mixed states
cognizable through the eye or through the ear?’ the Tathāgata would
answer thus: ’No mixed states cognizable through the eye or through
the ear are found in the Tathāgata.’</p>
<p>If asked, ’Are there found in the Tathāgata or not cleansed states
cognizable through the eye or through the ear?’ the Tathāgata would
answer thus: ’Cleansed states cognizable through the eye or through
the ear are found in the Tathāgata. These states are my pathway and my
domain, yet they are no cause for craving.’</p>
<p>A disciple should approach the Teacher who speaks thus in order to
hear the Dhamma. The Teacher teaches him the Dhamma with its higher
and higher levels, with its increasingly sublime levels, with its dark
and bright counterparts for comparison. As the Teacher teaches the
Dhamma to a monk in this way, through direct knowledge of a certain
teaching here in that Dhamma, the monk comes to a conclusion about the
teaching. He places confidence in the Teacher thus: ’The Blessed One
is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed
One, the Sangha is practising well.’</p>
<p>Now if others should ask that monk thus: ’What are your reasons and
what is your evidence whereby you say, “The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
Sangha is practising well?” ’ – answering rightly, that monk would
answer thus: ’Here, friends, I approached the Blessed One in order to
hear the Dhamma. The Blessed One taught me the Dhamma…. As the
Blessed One taught the Dhamma to me in this way, through direct
knowledge of a certain teaching here in that Dhamma, I came to a
conclusion about the teachings. I placed confidence in the Teacher
thus: ’The Blessed one is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well
proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha is practising well.”</p>
<p>Monks, when someone’s faith has been planted, rooted, and established
in the Tathāgata through these reasons, terms, and phrases, his faith
is said to be supported by reason, rooted in vision,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> firm, and it
is unable to be shaken by any recluse or brahmin or god or Māra or
Brahma or by anyone in the world. That is how there is an
investigation of the Tathāgata’s qualities, and that is how the
Tathāgata is well investigated in accordance with the Dhamma.</p>

<p>Doubts and hesitations, even about the Buddha himself, are not
considered wrong or wicked; they are merely states of mind which need to
be understood and dispelled by applying wisdom. And indeed, doubts can
encourage people to increase investigation and inquiry.</p>
<p>When people announced their devotion to and faith in the Buddha, before
bestowing approval the Buddha would examine whether their faith and
confidence was based on reasoned consideration, as is evident in the
following discussion between Ven. Sāriputta and the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’Lord, I have confidence in the Blessed One thus: “There has never
been, will be or is now another ascetic or brahmin who possesses
knowledge of perfect awakening superior to that of the Blessed One.” ’</p>
<p>’You have spoken valiantly,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup> Sāriputta, you have roared the lion’s
roar of certainty! How is this? Were you able to perceive the minds of
all the perfectly enlightened noble Buddhas of the past, so as to say:
“These Lords were of such virtue, such was their teaching, such their
wisdom, such their attributes, such their liberation”?’ {599}</p>
<p>’No, Lord.’</p>
<p>’And were you able to perceive the minds of all the perfectly
enlightened noble Buddhas who will appear in the future … “such
their liberation”?’</p>
<p>’No, Lord.’</p>
<p>’And I who am the perfectly enlightened noble Buddha of the present:
were you able to use your mind to perceive: “The Lord is of such
virtue … such his liberation”?’</p>
<p>’No, Lord.’</p>
<p>’So, as you do not have knowledge to perceive the minds of the
perfectly enlightened noble Buddhas of the past, the future or the
present, how is it that you have spoken valiantly and roared the
lion’s roar of certainty?’</p>
<p>’Lord, although I do not have the power to read the minds of the
perfectly enlightened noble Buddhas of the past, future, and present,
yet I know the way to realize the Dhamma.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>’Lord, it is as if there were a royal frontier city, with mighty
bastions and a massive encircling wall with fortifications in which is
a single gate, at which is a gatekeeper, wise, skilled and clever, who
keeps out strangers and lets in those he knows. And he, constantly
patrolling and following the course of the wall, does not see any
joins or clefts in the wall, even such as a cat might creep through.
He considers that whatever larger creatures enter or leave the city
must all go through this very gate.</p>
<p>’And in the same way, Lord, I know the way to realize the Dhamma: all
those perfectly enlightened noble Buddhas of the past attained to
supreme enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances, which defile
the mind and weaken the strength of wisdom, having firmly established
the four foundations of mindfulness in their minds, and developed the
seven factors of enlightenment according to the truth. All the
perfectly enlightened noble Buddhas of the future will do likewise,
and you, Lord, who are now the perfectly enlightened noble Buddha of
the present, have attained to supreme enlightenment by abandoning the
five hindrances … developed the seven factors of enlightenment
according to the truth.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>When handled correctly as an aid for spiritual progress, devotion to a
particular person can be beneficial. But it also has drawbacks because
it often turns into an attachment to the person and obstructs progress.
First, here is a sutta passage outlining the advantages of devotion:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The noble disciple who is completely dedicated to the Tathāgata and
has full confidence in him does not entertain any perplexity or doubt
about the Tathāgata or the Tathāgata’s teaching. It is indeed to be
expected, that a noble disciple who has faith will dwell with energy
roused for the abandoning of unwholesome states and the acquisition of
wholesome states; that he will be strong, firm in exertion, not
shirking the responsibility of cultivating wholesome states. {600}</p>
<p><em>S. V. 225.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The disadvantages of devotion to an individual are outlined in this
teaching:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these five disadvantages of devotion to one person.
What five?</p>
<p>When a person becomes very devoted to a person and that person commits
an offence such that the Order suspends him, then he will think: ’The
Order has suspended him who is dear and lovely to me!’</p>
<p>… When that person commits an offence such that the Order compels
him to sit at the end of the line, then he will think….</p>
<p>… When that person leaves for a distant place….</p>
<p>… When that person disrobes….</p>
<p>… When that person dies, then he will think: ’He is dead, he who was
dear and lovely to me!’</p>
<p>He will not associate with others monks, and from not associating with
other monks he will not hear the true Dhamma, and from not hearing the
true Dhamma he will fall away from the true Dhamma.</p>
<p><em>A. III. 270.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When devotion and faith turn into a feeling of love, personal prejudice
can impede the operation of wisdom, as demonstrated in this sutta
passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, these four things may be generated. What four?</p>
<p>Of love is born love; of love is born anger; of anger is born love; of
anger is born anger….</p>
<p>And how is anger born of love? A person who one finds dear, feels
affection for, and approves of, is treated by other people in a way
that is disagreeable, offensive, and unpleasant, so he conceives
ill-will towards those people….</p>
<p><em>A. II. 213.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Even devotion to the Buddha can be an obstacle for highest liberation
when this devotion becomes personal, and the Buddha encouraged his
disciples to abandon such love. At times he used rather extreme measures
while teaching his disciples, as in the case of Ven. Vakkali, who was
ardently devoted to the Buddha and wished to keep close to him at all
times.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his life Ven. Vakkali was seriously ill and sent a
message to the Buddha requesting to see him. The Buddha visited him and
offered the following teaching:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Vakkali:</em> ’For a long time, venerable sir, I have wanted to come to
see the Blessed One, but my body has not been strong enough to do so.’</p>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> ’Enough, Vakkali! Why do you want to see this foul body? One
who sees the Dhamma sees me; one who sees me sees the Dhamma. For in
seeing the Dhamma, Vakkali, one sees me; and in seeing me, one sees
the Dhamma.’ {601}</p>
<p><em>S. III. 119-120.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Spiritual progress restricted to the level of faith is not stable or
secure, because faith depends on external conditions and may weaken, as
confirmed by this teaching of the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Here, Bhaddāli, suppose a man has only one eye; then his friends and
companions, his kinsmen and relatives, would help to guard his eye,
thinking: ’Let him not lose his one eye.’ So too, some monk in this
Dhamma and Discipline practises by a measure of faith and love. In
this case other monks consider thus: ’This monk practises by a measure
of faith and love. We should help by repeatedly urging him to act so
that he may not lose that measure of faith and love.’ This is the
cause, this is the reason, why one [must] repeatedly urge some monks
in this dispensation to attend to [their] obligations.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 444-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When not developed to the stage of wisdom, faith is limited. It may lead
to a heavenly rebirth but it cannot on its own lead to the final goal of
Buddha-Dhamma, as confirmed by this teaching of the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, in the Dhamma well-proclaimed by me, which is clear, open
and evident, there are no hidden catches:</p>
<p>There is no future round for manifestation in the case of those
bhikkhus who are arahants with taints destroyed….</p>
<p>Those bhikkhus who have abandoned the five lower fetters are all due
to reappear spontaneously [in the Pure Abodes] and there attain
final Nibbāna….</p>
<p>Those bhikkhus who have abandoned the three lower fetters and
attenuated lust, hate, and delusion are all once-returners….</p>
<p>Those bhikkhus who have abandoned three fetters are all
stream-enterers….</p>
<p>Those bhikkhus who are truth-devotees (dhammānusārī) or faith-devotees
(saddhānusārī) are all headed for awakening….</p>
<p>Those bhikkhus who merely have faith in me, merely have love for me,
are all headed for heaven.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 141-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the context of wisdom development, wisdom initially benefits from
correct faith and then develops gradually until it reaches the stage of
’knowledge and vision’ (<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>). At this stage it is no longer
necessary to rely on beliefs and opinions because one knows and sees
clearly for oneself, and therefore this stage transcends the domain of
faith:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ven. Saviṭṭha:</em> ’Friend Musīla, apart from faith, apart from personal
preference, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned reflection,
apart from conformity with doctrinal analysis, does the Venerable
Musīla have personal knowledge thus: “With birth as condition,
aging-and-death comes to be”?’</p>
<p><em>Ven. Musīla:</em> ’Friend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, apart from personal

this: “With birth as condition, aging-and-death comes to be.” ’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup>
{602}</p>
<p><em>S. II. 115-18.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This sutta passage continues:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’Monks, is there a method of exposition by means of which a monk –
apart from faith, apart from personal preference, apart from oral
tradition, apart from reasoned reflection, apart from conformity with
doctrinal analysis – can declare final knowledge thus: “Destroyed is
birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been
done, there is nothing more to be done to reach this state”?….</p>
<p>’There is a method of exposition…. Here, having seen a form with the
eye, if there is lust, hatred or delusion internally, a monk
understands: “There is lust, hatred or delusion internally”; or, if
there is no lust, hatred or delusion internally, he understands:
“There is no lust, hatred, or delusion internally.”</p>
<p>’Since this is so, are these things to be understood by faith, or by
personal preference, or by oral tradition, or by reasoned reflection,
or by conformity with doctrinal analysis?’</p>
<p>’No, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>’Aren’t these things to be understood by seeing them with wisdom?’</p>
<p>’Yes, venerable sir.’</p>

– can declare final knowledge….’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. IV. 138-40.</em></p>

</div>
<p>When a person has clear knowledge and vision, faith is no longer
required: the person does not need to believe someone else. The Buddha’s
disciples who had attained to outstanding qualities knew and spoke about
these things without needing to refer to the Buddha, as is illustrated
in the following conversation between the Jain leader Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta
and the householder Citta, an eminent disciple of the Buddha proficient
in Buddha-Dhamma:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nigaṇṭha:</em> ’Householder, do you have faith in the ascetic Gotama when
he says: “There is a concentration without applied thought and
sustained thought; there is a cessation of applied thought and
sustained thought”?’</p>
<p><em>Citta:</em> ’In this matter, venerable sir, I do not go by faith in the
Blessed One when he says: “There is a concentration without applied
thought and sustained thought; there is a cessation of applied thought
and sustained thought”….</p>
<p>’To whatever extent I wish … I enter and dwell in the first jhāna
… I enter and dwell in the second jhāna … I enter and dwell in the
third jhāna … I enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup> Since I
know and see thus, I do not believe with faith in any ascetic or
brahmin regarding the claim that there is a concentration without
applied and sustained thought, there is a cessation of applied and
sustained thought.’</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 298-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Arahants, who have reached the highest degree of knowledge and vision,
possess the attribute of ’faithlessness’ (<em>assaddha</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup> they do not
need to believe anyone else on matters that they clearly see for
themselves, as confirmed by this discussion between the Buddha and Ven.
Sāriputta: {603}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> ’Sāriputta, do you have faith that the faculty of faith,
when developed and cultivated, penetrates to the Deathless, has the
Deathless as its destination, has the Deathless as its final goal? …
That the faculty of energy…. That the faculty of mindfulness….
That the faculty of concentration…. That the faculty of wisdom….
has the Deathless as its final goal?’</p>
<p><em>Sāriputta:</em> ’In this matter I do not go by faith in the Blessed
One…. Those who do not know, see, understand, realize, and discern
with wisdom – they would have to go by faith in others in regard to
this…. But those who know, see, understand, realize, and discern
these things with wisdom – they would be without perplexity or doubt
about this matter…. I have known, seen, understood, realized and
discerned these things with wisdom – therefore, I have no doubts or
uncertainties about this matter: the faculty of faith … the faculty
of energy…. the faculty of mindfulness…. the faculty of
concentration…. the faculty of wisdom when developed and cultivated,
penetrates to the Deathless, has the Deathless as its destination, has
the Deathless as its final goal.’</p>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> ’Good, good, Sāriputta.’</p>
<p><em>S. V. 220-22.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These following passages by the Buddha highlight the vital significance
of wisdom:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, by having developed and cultivated how many faculties does a
bhikkhu who has destroyed the taints declare the fruit of arahantship
and understand thus: ’Destroyed is birth … there is nothing more to
be done to reach this state’?</p>
<p>It is because he has developed and cultivated one faculty that a
bhikkhu who has destroyed the taints declares the fruit of arahantship
thus. What is that one faculty? The faculty of wisdom.</p>
<p>For a noble disciple who possesses wisdom, the faith that follows from
it becomes stabilized, the energy … mindfulness … concentration
that follows from it becomes stabilized.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 222.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>So long as the faculty of wisdom is absent, the other faculties of
faith, energy, mindfulness, and concentration, on their own or combined,
cannot bring about enlightenment:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, just as the footprints of land animals fit into the
footprint of the elephant, and the elephant’s footprint is declared to
be their chief by reason of its size, so too, among the steps that
lead to awakening, the faculty of wisdom is declared to be their
chief, that is, for the realization of awakening.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup> {604}</p>
<p><em>S. V. 231-2, 237-9.</em></p>

</div>
<h2 id="preparation-for-the-middle-way"><a class="header" href="#preparation-for-the-middle-way">Preparation for the Middle Way</a></h2>
<p>To sum up, ordinary people, who are not yet proficient in wisdom,
require guidance and encouragement from others. For them wisdom
development begins with the external factor of virtuous friendship, in
order for faith to be established. (Faith here refers to the confidence
springing from well-reasoned discernment.)</p>
<p>From here one reaches the function of internal factors, beginning with
applying the knowledge on which faith is based in order to think
independently from others in an analytic way. Such analytic reflection
gives rise to right view and advances the development of wisdom,
resulting eventually in clear knowledge and vision (<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>).
(See
Note <a href="#note-wise-reflection">Three Kinds of Wise Reflection</a>.)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Three Kinds of Wise Reflection</span><a id="note-wise-reflection"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A person who helps guide others may use the following three kinds of
wise reflection as basic principles for checking other people’s level
of intelligence or ability to reflect wisely:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thinking corresponding with conditionality: to see whether the
other person thinks reasonably and systematically, and is able to
investigate causes and conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analytic reflection: to see whether the other person is able to
look at things from different perspectives, is able to distinguish
various potentialities, and does not look at things in a vague or
one-dimensional way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reflection on the relationship between the principles (<em>dhamma</em>)
and the objective (<em>attha</em>) of things: to see whether the person,
after hearing or reading something, is able to grasp both its
principles, crucial points, or gist, and its meaning, objective,
value, benefit, and ways of elaborating on its main points.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Because faith (<em>saddhā</em>) is a very important factor, and when it is
appropriate and used correctly it is compatible with analytical
reflection, leading to wisdom and right view, let us review its
practical dimensions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the level of virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>), faith is a basic
principle, protecting one’s virtue, holding one back from acting
immorally, and establishing one firmly in upright behaviour.
Although one’s faith may not yet be accompanied by wisdom, it is
still valid. Indeed, in many circumstances faith based on
deep-seated beliefs is more effective on the level of moral conduct
than faith based on wise reflection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the level of concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), faith is conducive to
concentration. It leads to rapture and bliss, deep tranquillity, and
an absence of restlessness and agitation, and it also leads to
determined effort, courage, fearlessness, focused attention,
potency, and stability. Although faith in this context is also based
on deep-seated convictions rather than grounded reasoning, it too is
valid.</p>
<p>Although this faith based on beliefs is effective for these first
two levels of practice, it has the disadvantages of leading to
narrow-mindedness and an unwillingness to listen to others, and
sometimes it is the cause for oppressing others due to one’s
personal beliefs. And importantly in this context, it is not
supportive to wisdom development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the level of wisdom (<em>paññā</em>), faith is conducive to wisdom,
beginning with establishing mundane right view. From here it links
with wise reflection in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, faith is a channel enabling virtuous friends to point out
how to think constructively – to encourage people to apply wise
reflection (otherwise they may not be open to guidance and
teaching).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, it prepares the foundation or context for some subjects
of contemplation and independent reflection. Faith at this stage
is clearly connected to wisdom; it is the most desirable form of
faith. {681}</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To ensure that faith supports wisdom in the process of analytical
reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), there are several factors to bear in
mind in regard to one’s practice vis-à-vis faith:</p>
<p>First, to have ’rational’ faith or to have beliefs accompanied by
reasoned thinking. One’s faith is not of the kind that forces one to
believe; the object of faith does not need to be accepted according to
rigid stipulations or followed without giving an opportunity to reasoned
discernment. One’s faith neither obstructs nor coerces one’s thinking,
nor does it lead to an unwillingness to listen to others.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup> Instead,
it supports reasoned analysis and contributes to wisdom development.</p>
<p>Second, one’s behaviour is marked by <em>saccānurakkha</em>: a guarding or love
of the truth. One is devoted to truth and one expresses one’s faith
honestly and accurately. One has the prerogative to state one’s beliefs,
for example by saying, ’These are my beliefs’, or ’I believe in that’,
but one doesn’t use one’s faith as the decisive factor for determining
truth. One does not insist that the truth accord with one’s beliefs or
declare something that is merely a belief as the absolute truth; for
example, instead of saying, ’This matter <em>is</em> this way!’ one declares,
’I believe that this matter is this way.’</p>
<p>Third, one uses one’s faith or one’s beliefs as a foundation for
analytical reflection, giving rise to wisdom. In other words, faith is
not an end in itself, but is rather an instrument or ladder leading to a
higher goal: the objective of faith is wisdom.</p>
<p>This corresponds with the standard sequence of wisdom development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Associating with virtuous people →<br />
listening to the true Dhamma →<br />
faith →<br />
wise reflection, etc.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following on from wise reflection is the arising of right view
(<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>), which marks the advent of the Middle Way – the
beginning of a virtuous, righteous way of life. {682}</p>
<h2 id="the-triple-gem-as-a-conduit-to-the-middle-way"><a class="header" href="#the-triple-gem-as-a-conduit-to-the-middle-way">The Triple Gem as a Conduit to the Middle Way</a></h2>
<p>The Triple Gem – the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha – is a
cornerstone for Buddhists. Generally speaking, taking refuge
(<em>saraṇa-gamana</em>) in the Triple Gem is a symbol of being a Buddhist or a
lay disciple. Even stream-enterers possess the attribute of being one
with firm, unshakeable faith in the Triple Gem. It is thus worthy of
study to determine how reverence for the Triple Gem fits into the
practice of the Middle Way.</p>
<p>Both the respect for the Triple Gem expressed by going for refuge by
general people and the unshakeable faith in the Triple Gem belonging to
stream-enterers clearly indicate the prominent role of faith (<em>saddhā</em>)
for Buddhists at initial stages of practice.</p>
<p>From what has been described above one can see that faith is part of the
beginning stages of the Middle Way. In particular it helps to link
people with virtuous friends (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>) or wholesome instruction
by others. The aim is to link faith with analytical reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), and most importantly for faith to lead to wisdom
– to give rise to right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>), which is the first
factor of the Noble Eightfold Path and the Middle Way.</p>
<p>Here we can see the clear relationship between the Triple Gem and
practice in accord with the Middle Way, in that faith in the Triple Gem
is a conduit to the Middle Way.</p>
<p>To add to this explanation one should consider the four factors of
stream-entry (<em>sotāpattiyaṅga</em>), also known as the four virtues
conducive to growth in wisdom (<em>paññāvuḍḍhi-dhamma</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sappurisa-saṁseva</em>: association with virtuous people; association
with the wise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Saddhammassavana</em>: hearing the true Dhamma; learning what is
correct and good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yoniso-manasikāra</em>: wise reflection; proper attention; skilful
consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>: practising minor principles of Dhamma
consistent with major principles; practising the Dhamma correctly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This group of factors is referred to by many other names, including:
’qualities conducive to the realization of the fruit of stream-entry up
to the realization of arahantship’:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, these four things, when developed and cultivated, lead to the
realization of the fruit of stream-entry … to the realization of the
fruit of once-returning … to the realization of the fruit of
non-returning … to the realization of the fruit of arahantship. What
four? Association with superior persons, hearing the true Dhamma, wise
reflection, practice in accord with the Dhamma.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup> {683}</p>
<p><em>S. V. 410-11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Association with superior persons (<em>sappurisa-saṁseva</em>) is equivalent to
having virtuous friends (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>). The Buddha is the supreme
superior person and virtuous friend.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup> Associating with wise people
and having virtuous friends leads to beneficial instruction by others
(<em>paratoghosa</em>), that is, hearing or learning the Dhamma – true,
wholesome teachings.</p>
<p>Systematic reflection of the Dhamma – reflection in line with the
Dhamma – gives rise to wholesome qualities and to wisdom, which
comprehends things correctly according to the truth. Moreover, it leads
to a Dhamma practice that is authentic and true to the goal.</p>
<p>A correct practice of the Dhamma (<em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>) culminates
in the realization of stream-entry, all the way to the realization of
arahantship. Those who have arrived at these noble realizations comprise
the genuine Buddhist community. They are called the community of
disciples (<em>sāvaka-saṅgha</em>) or the noble community (<em>ariya-saṅgha</em>), and
they represent the ’Sangha’ in the Triple Gem.</p>
<p>In this sense one can describe the duties by Buddhists in relation to
the Triple Gem as the following: to start with, one acknowledges the
Buddha as a ’virtuous friend’; one then listens to and studies the
Buddha’s teachings. From here one reflects wisely on these teachings,
thus completing the two preliminary stages of the Middle Way – virtuous
friendship and wise reflection – which are the prerequisites for right
view.</p>
<p>When one sees things correctly according to the truth, one practices the
Dhamma correctly (<em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>) – one follows the middle
path of practice (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup> One completes this path
with the attainment of arahantship, and is consequently a ’noble being’
(<em>ariya-puggala</em>) and a member of the noble Sangha. As a noble being one
is able to assist others and to act as a virtuous friend one step down
from the Buddha himself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Sangha is a model community or society, a gathering
point of those who receive the benefits of having the Buddha as a
virtuous friend and of following the path of righteousness
(<em>dhamma-magga</em>). The Sangha is a source of virtuous friendship for
others; it is a ’field of merit’ (<em>puññakkhetta</em>), increasing and
spreading goodness in the world.</p>
<p>The Sangha is one of the mainstays of the Triple Gem. The inclusion of
the Sangha in the Triple Gem reveals how much importance Buddhism gives
to the involvement and participation by virtuous people in society,
which is improved and elevated through a collective effort.</p>
<p>Internally, or in relation to the mind, members of the Sangha are
safeguarded by their states of realization. Externally, or in relation
to life in society, their safeguards are the formal discipline (Vinaya),
communal harmony, and mutual friendship.</p>
<p>The relationship between these principles of the four factors of
stream-entry, practice according to the Middle Way, and the Triple Gem
can be illustrated thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Association with the wise (<em>sappurisa-saṁseva</em>) = virtuous
friendship (<em>kalyāṇamittatā</em>) = the Buddha (as the supreme friend).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hearing the true Dhamma (<em>saddhammassavana</em>) = wholesome instruction
by others (<em>paratoghosa</em>) = the Dhamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) = wise reflection = (one’s
duty in regard to the Dhamma).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Practising the Dhamma correctly (<em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>) = the
Path (<em>magga</em>) = to enter into the noble Sangha. {684}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From what has been said above it is possible to provide a brief
definition for the Triple Gem as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Buddha: the one who realized and taught the Dhamma, discovered
the Path and revealed it to others, and acted as the foremost
virtuous friend. He represents an ideal, confirming the goodness,
capability, and wisdom that human beings can train in and develop in
themselves, culminating in the attainment of the supreme state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Dhamma: the principles of truth and virtue which the Buddha
discovered and taught. Faithful disciples should listen to, study,
and contemplate these teachings with wise reflection, in order to
correctly understand the truth, cultivate the Path, and reach
spiritual fulfilment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Sangha: the community of individuals who practise according to
the Path and who have reached success. Those people who trust that
this community of awakened individuals is truly excellent should
participate in building and joining this community by cultivating
the Path and experiencing its fruits. Such practice begins with
emulating the external traits and characteristics of noble beings –
of moral discipline, communal harmony, and mutual friendship.</p>
<p>Virtuous friendship, wise reflection of the Dhamma, and practice in
accord with the Eightfold Path prospers and reaches fulfilment in a
community which lives in accord with the principles embodied by this
noble Sangha.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Triple Gem is a refuge in so far as recollection of the Triple Gem
reminds people to use correct methods for solving problems and ending
suffering. One follows the teachings on the Four Noble Truths and walks
the noble path (<em>ariya-vīthi</em>). At the very least, this recollection
helps prevent one from doing evil, generates a determination to do good,
builds confidence, dispels fear, and strengthens and brightens the mind.

<h2 id="appendix-1-translating-pali-terms-from-the-kālāma-sutta"><a class="header" href="#appendix-1-translating-pali-terms-from-the-kālāma-sutta">Appendix 1: Translating Pali Terms from the Kālāma Sutta</a></h2>
<p>Attempting to translate the ten factors connected to belief contained in
the Kālāma Sutta is one example of how difficult it can be to
satisfactorily and accurately translate Pali terms and phrases. In this
case, one of the reasons for this difficulty is that these phrases lack
a verb form; they simply contain the term <em>mā</em>, which translates as ’do
not’ (grammatically referred to as an ’interjection’ – <em>nipāta</em>). Let
us look at the first three factors as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Mā anussavena</em> (’do not … by way of holding to oral tradition’).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mā paramparāya</em> (’do not … by way of a lineage of teaching’).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mā itikirāya</em> (’do not … by way of hearsay’).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem here for translators is deciding which verb to place within
the ellipsis. Traditionally, this problem has been solved by translating
this phrase as: ’do not believe….’ For a closer inspection of this
matter, one should examine Thai translated versions of the Tipiṭaka.
When <em>Buddhadhamma</em> was first published in 1971, there existed only one
Thai translated version: Thai Tipiṭaka: A Tribute to 25 Centuries of
Buddhism, 2500 BE., which translates this phrase as <em>yah yeut theu….</em>
(อย่ายึดถือ – ’do not grasp’, ’do not assume’).</p>
<p>Questioning the accuracy of this translation, I examined the
commentarial explanation for this phrase. In this context, the
commentaries add the verb <em>gaṇhittha</em>, rendering the phrase similarly as
’do not grasp’, ’do not assume’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup> {605} This interpretation is
consistent with other commentarial texts (these ten factors are found in
other suttas, e.g.: the Sāḷha Sutta and the Bhaddiya Sutta).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup> The
commentaries to the Bhaddiya Sutta, for example, provide the same
interpretation as <em>mā gaṇhittha</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>This indicates that the translators of the ’Thai Tipiṭaka: A Tribute to
25 Centuries of Buddhism, 2500 BE’. translated this passage
corresponding to the commentarial explanations. Still not fully
satisfied with this translation, I needed to consider the alternatives.</p>
<p>Besides wishing to convey the sense of these passages accurately, one
reason why I endeavoured to find a suitable translation is because when
<em>Buddhadhamma</em> was first published thirty-six years ago, Thai people had
only just begun to hear about and discuss the Kālāma Sutta. (This sutta
was already familiar among Westerners, who found it interesting and
astonishing that here was a religion that told people to suspend belief
– there is no obligation to believe. This interest then extended to
Thai people.) But instead of applying this meaning for the pursuit of
wisdom, many Thai people interpreted this teaching for the sake of
casualness, glibness, or frivolity. Some people claimed jokingly or
disparagingly that the Buddha taught people not to believe their
teachers and mentors. (As a result, many teachers of Buddhism during
that time period would try and emphasize that the Buddha’s teachings in
the Kālāma Sutta do not mean that one should disregard one’s teachers.)</p>
<p>These were some of the issues involved in trying to find a suitable
translation for these passages.</p>
<p>Besides providing accurate data and factual evidence on these matters,
it is also important to allow readers to access the original
information, along with related material, in the most complete way as
possible, so that they can consider these matters independently. There
is always the danger that the opinions by an author, or interpretations
by a translator, conceal the original information, and that authors or
translators inadvertently monopolize ideas.</p>
<p>In the case that authors or translators come up with new interpretations
or translations, it behoves them to inform the readers of this and share
with them the original data, so that the readers can distinguish between
what is the original and what is new.</p>
<p>In regard to material within the Tipiṭaka, it is helpful and suitable to
provide explanations from the commentaries and other texts. The more the
better, because this will provide an opportunity for students of
Buddhism to apply their own judgment in these matters. This corresponds
with the principle of viewing the Buddhist scriptures as a source of
knowledge rather than as texts requiring unquestioned belief.</p>
<p>(In this book in particular, whereby the aim is to describe the
traditional Buddhist teachings, rather than to express personal
interpretations, it is important to produce as much supportive data as
possible. In the case that personal understanding and interpretations
are expressed, these should be clearly distinguished from the source
material, for example the words of the Buddha contained in the suttas.)</p>
<p>Because I hadn’t yet come up with a suitable alternative, I continued to
use the translation <em>yah yeut theu</em> (’do not grasp’, ’do not assume’)
contained in the ’Thai Tipiṭaka: A Tribute to 25 Centuries of Buddhism,
2500 BE’. and based on the commentaries, but with an explanatory
footnote.</p>
<p>The original edition of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> (1971, contained within the Wan
Waithayakon collection) contains this footnote: ’The term “do not
assume” here is an interim phrase, as no adequate substitute has been
found. Understand this phrase to mean “do not make a judgement or
establish an opinion in an absolute, categorical way based on any of
these factors alone”.’</p>
<p>A year later, in 1972, I began work on ’A Dictionary of Buddhism’
(พจนานุกรมพุทธศาสน์ ฉบับประมวลธรรม), which was first published in 1975.
Here, in regard to the ten means for dealing with doubtful matters as
contained in the Kālāma Sutta (<em>kālāmasutta-kaṅkhāniyaṭṭhāna</em>), I began
to use an alternative translation, which seemed more satisfactory,
namely: <em>yah bplong jy cheua</em> (อย่าปลงใจเชื่อ – ’do not (decisively)
believe’, ’be not led by’). This translation does not conflict with the
commentarial interpretation <em>mā gaṇhittha</em>. {606}</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be not led by report (<em>anussava</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be not led by tradition (<em>paramparā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be not led by hearsay (<em>itikirā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be not led by the authority of texts (<em>piṭaka-sampadāna</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be not led by mere logic (<em>takka</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be not led by inference (<em>naya</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be not led by considering appearances (<em>ākāra-parivitakka</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be not led by the agreement with a considered and approved theory
(<em>diṭṭhi-nijjhānakkhanti</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be not led by seeming possibilities (<em>bhabba-rūpatā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be not led by the idea: ’This is our teacher’ (samaṇo no
garūti).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(In 1996 the Thai Tipiṭaka ’Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University
Edition’ was printed and for each of these ten factors the translators
applied the phrase อย่าปลงใจเชื่อ, <em>yah bplong jy cheua</em>.)</p>
<p>In 1978 I began to work on the expanded version of <em>Buddhadhamma</em>
(’Buddhadhamma: Revised and Expanded Edition’), which was first printed
in 1982. Although many changes and additions were made to this expanded
version, I did not change the translation of this phrase in the Kālāma
Sutta according to the changes made in the Dictionary of Buddhism. (In
contrast, the ’Dictionary of Buddhist Terminology’ – พจนานุกรมพุทธศาสน์
ฉบับประมวลศัพท์ – first published in 1979, contained the changes made
in the Dictionary of Buddhist Teachings.) Instead, the volume
’Buddhadhamma: Revised and Expanded Edition’ contains the following
footnote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’The expression here อย่ายึดถือ (<em>yah yeut theu</em>) means to not make a
judgement or establish an opinion in an absolute, categorical way
based on any of these factors alone; it should be understood as
corresponding to the expression อย่าปลงใจเชื่อ (<em>yah bplong jy
cheua</em>). Moreover, one should not interpret this expression to mean
that the Buddha taught his disciples to disbelieve these particular
things and rather to believe in other things. The Buddha warned his
disciples from being utterly convinced even by these highly inspiring
qualities: one should not be too eager to believe in them and take
them as the ultimate criteria for truth, as they may possibly be
incorrect. He encouraged people to carefully reflect on these highly
inspiring and credible factors with wisdom. Consider how much care we
must take when we engage with other factors and people.’</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although I have provided these various translations along with the
background on how they have been determined, this does not confirm that
they are the most suitable translations. Students of Buddhism can refer
to the information and source material presented here in order to
increase their own understanding on this matter. In the same vein, if
one encounters a more suitable translation for this phrase one should
accept it with satisfaction.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>Apart from learning about this specific subject matter, readers may gain
an appreciation here for how complicated and difficult in can be to
translate Pali terms and phrases contained in the Buddhist scriptures.</p>

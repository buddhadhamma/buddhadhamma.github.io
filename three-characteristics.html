<h2><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The primary Buddhist tenet that all things can be separated into
component parts is not intended to suggest a static world of composite
objects. Rather, all things are seen to exist in the form of a stream.
Each constituent element of that stream comes into being in dependence
on other elements in an unbroken flow of appearance and decline. No
single element has an independent fixed identity; they are all
impermanent and unstable. Indeed, the fluid nature of phenomena is
possible owing to the interdependence and insubstantiality of their
components.</p>
<p>This stream of conditioned phenomena is naturally steady (<em>dhātu</em>),
naturally stable and certain (<em>dhammaṭṭhiti</em>), and it is part of a
natural order (<em>dhamma-niyāma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> It does not rely for its existence
on a god, religion or prophet. {63} In Buddha-Dhamma the role of a
Teacher<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> is that of discovering and explaining this truth to others.</p>
<p>The Buddha presented the teaching of the Three Characteristics
(<em>tilakkhaṇa</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> to describe this natural law of flux (See
Note <a href="#note-flux">Dependent Origination as Law of Flux</a>). The teaching is outlined in this way:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Whether Tathāgatas<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> appear or not, this truth (<em>dhātu</em>) exists as
constant and stable ... that is:</p>
<p>All conditioned phenomena (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) are impermanent....</p>
<p>All conditioned phenomena are <em>dukkha</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>....</p>
<p>All things (<em>dhamma</em>) are nonself....</p>
<p>Having fully awakened to and penetrated to this truth, a Tathāgata
announces, teaches, clarifies, formulates, reveals, and analyzes it:
that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, all conditioned
phenomena are dukkha, and all things are nonself.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 286.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Definitions of the three characteristics are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Aniccatā</strong>: impermanence, instability, and inconstancy; the
condition of arising, deteriorating, and disintegrating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dukkhatā</strong>: state of <em>dukkha</em>; the condition of oppression by
birth and decay; the inherent stress, resistance and conflict within
an object due to alteration of its determinant factors, preventing
it from remaining as it is; the internal imperfection of things,
which prevents true satisfaction for someone whose desires are
influenced by craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), and causes suffering for a person
subject to clinging (<em>upādāna</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anattatā</strong>: the condition of <em>anattā</em> – nonself; the condition of
things being void of a real abiding self that owns or controls
phenomena.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Dependent Origination as Law of Flux</span><a id="note-flux"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another key teaching by the Buddha is on Dependent Origination
(<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>). This teaching describes the law of flux from a
different angle and illustrates the same truth. The Three
Characteristics shows the properties of all things, properties that
correspond with the relationship outlined in Dependent Origination.
Dependent Origination describes the conditioned flow of phenomena,
revealing the three characteristics.</p>
<p>[Trans.: see chapter 4 on Dependent Origination. As a teaching I have
capitalized ‘Three Characteristics’, but when referring to these three
signs as attributes of nature, I have not.]</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Pali adjectival terms for these characteristics are <em>anicca</em>,
<em>dukkha</em>, and <em>anattā</em>, respectively. The abstract noun forms are
<em>aniccatā</em>, <em>dukkhatā</em>, and <em>anattatā</em>. As characteristics they are
known as <em>anicca-lakkhaṇa</em>, <em>dukkha-lakkhaṇa</em>, and <em>anatta-lakkhaṇa</em>.
The commentaries occasionally refer to the three characteristics as
‘universal characteristics’ (<em>sāmañña-lakkhaṇa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> {64}</p>
<p>All conditioned things exist in a state of flux, made up of
interdependent conditioning factors, which arise and pass away in
unbroken succession: things are impermanent. Because of their
instability and causal dependence, conditioned things are subject to
stress and friction, revealing an inherent imperfection. And all things,
both conditioned things and the Unconditioned, exist according to their
own nature; they possess no self that acts as owner or governor of
phenomena.</p>
<p>Human beings too are comprised of constituent elements. The
‘building-blocks’ for human beings are the five aggregates; nothing else
exists besides the five aggregates.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup> When we examine the five
aggregates in turn, we see that each one is impermanent. Being
impermanent, they are <em>dukkha</em>; they are distressing for one who grasps
them. Being <em>dukkha</em>, they are selfless. They are selfless because each
aggregate arises from causes and conditions; they are not independent
entities. Furthermore, they are not truly subject to a person’s control
or ownership. If one were to truly own the five aggregates, one would be
able to control them according to one’s will and prohibit them from
change, for example from debility or disease.</p>
<p>A key teaching by the Buddha describing the three characteristics in the
context of the five aggregates is as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>‘Bhikkhus, the body is not-self. If the body were self it would not
lead to affliction, and it would be possible to have it of the body:
“May my body be this way; may it not be that way.” But because the
body is not-self, the body leads to affliction, and it is not possible
to have it of the body: “May my body be this way; may it not be that
way.”</p>
<p>‘Feeling is not-self.... Perception is not-self.... Volitional
formations are not-self.... Consciousness is not-self. For if
consciousness were self it would not lead to affliction, and it would
be possible to have it of consciousness: “May my consciousness be this
way; may it not be that way.” But because consciousness is not-self,
consciousness leads to affliction, and it is not possible to have it
of consciousness: “May my consciousness be this way; may it not be
that way.”</p>
<p>‘What do you think, monks, is the body permanent or impermanent?’</p>
<p>‘Impermanent, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>‘Is that which is impermanent oppressive or easeful?’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>‘Oppressive, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>‘Is what is impermanent, oppressive and of the nature to change fit to
be regarded thus: “This is mine, this is I, this is my self?” ‘</p>
<p>‘No, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>‘What do you think, monks, are feelings permanent or impermanent?’....
‘Is perception permanent or impermanent?’.... ‘Are volitional
formations permanent or impermanent?’.... ‘Is consciousness permanent
or impermanent?’....</p>
<p>‘Is what is impermanent, oppressive and of the nature to change fit to
be regarded thus: “This is mine, this is I, this is my self?” ‘</p>
<p>‘No, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>‘Therefore, monks, you should see any kind of physical form ...
feeling ... perception ... volitional formation ... consciousness
whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external,
coarse or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, as it actually is
with proper wisdom thus: “This is not mine, this is not I, this is not
my self.” ‘ {65}</p>
<p><em>S. III. 66-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Many scholars have tried to prove that the Buddha acknowledged a self
existing apart from the five aggregates. They claim that he only
repudiated a self within conditioned phenomena and that he affirmed an
Ultimate Self. Moreover, they explain that Nibbāna<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> is the same as
<em>ātman/attā</em>: Nibbāna <em>is</em> the Self. I will elaborate on this matter in
Chapter 6, on Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Here, let it simply suffice to say that all things exist according to
their own inherent nature, which conflicts with the concept of a static,
controlling essence or ‘self’. Things exist as they do precisely because
they do not possess such a self. (If a self were to exist and to
interfere, things would not be able to exist as they do.)</p>
<p>Most people, especially those who have grown up in a culture espousing a
‘self’ or ‘soul’, tend to seek out and seize some concept of a fixed
identity. Acting in this way satisfies a hidden, unconscious need. When
their self-identification as one or more of the five aggregates becomes
untenable, they create a new concept of self in which to believe. But
the aim of Buddha-Dhamma is not to release one thing so as to grasp
another, or to be freed from one thing only to then be enslaved by
something else. As mentioned earlier, things exist according to their
own nature. Their nature of existence is determined by the
characteristic of nonself; if things were to possess a self then by
definition they could not exist as they do. {66}</p>

impermanent and <em>dukkha</em>, respectively, but in the third statement he
says that all things (<em>dhamma</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> are nonself. This indicates a
distinction between the first two characteristics and the third
characteristic. To understand this distinction one must examine the
words <em>saṅkhāra</em> and <em>dhamma</em>.</p>
<p>The Pali word <em>dhamma</em> has an all-encompassing range of meaning,
covering all things: everything that exists – past, present and future,
both real and imaginary. Material and mental, good and bad, and ordinary
and exceptional things are all included within the meaning of this word.
In Pali, when a restricted or more specific definition is desired, a
modifier may be added to the word <em>dhamma</em>, or the object to be defined
is divided into sub-categories. Alternatively, the word <em>dhamma</em> can be
used unmodified within a specific context. For example, paired with
<em>adhamma</em>, or used to describe moral behaviour, it means merit (<em>puñña</em>)
or goodness. When it is used with <em>attha</em> it means rule, principle, or
cause. When <em>dhamma</em> is used in relation to study it means the
scriptures, the Buddha’s discourses.</p>
<p>In the third statement of the Three Characteristics pertaining to
nonself, the Buddha uses the term <em>dhamma</em> in its broadest sense,
referring to all things, without exception. To understand <em>dhamma</em> in
this context it is helpful to divide things into categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Material things (<em>rūpa-dhamma</em>) and immaterial things
(<em>nāma-dhamma</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mundane things (<em>lokiya-dhamma</em>) and transcendent things
(<em>lokuttara-dhamma</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conditioned things (<em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>) and the Unconditioned
(<em>asaṅkhata-dhamma</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wholesome things (<em>kusala-dhamma</em>), unwholesome things
(<em>akusala-dhamma</em>), and neutral things (<em>abyākata-dhamma</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each group above incorporates the entire meaning of <em>dhamma</em>, but the
group that corresponds with the subject to be studied here is that of
conditioned things and the Unconditioned.</p>
<p>All things can be divided into two types:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Saṅkhata-dhamma</em>: constructed things; things that arise from
conditioning factors (<em>paccaya</em>); things formed by the merging of
such factors. These things are also called <em>saṅkhāra</em>, which has the
same root and translation. Both <em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em> and <em>saṅkhāra</em>
refer to every kind of condition, material and mental, mundane and
supra-mundane, except Nibbāna.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Asaṅkhata-dhamma</em>: that which is not constructed; the state that
does not arise by being fashioned from conditioning factors and is
not subject to them. It is also called <em>visaṅkhāra</em>, meaning the
state free from conditioned phenomena – the Unconditioned – that
is, Nibbāna. {67}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Saṅkhāra</em> is therefore just one aspect of the term <em>dhamma</em>. <em>Dhamma</em>
has a range of meaning that embraces both conditioned phenomena and the
Unconditioned: <em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em> and <em>asaṅkhata-dhamma</em>, or <em>saṅkhāra</em>
and Nibbāna. Applying this to the Three Characteristics, one sees that
the scope of the first two characteristics, <em>aniccatā</em> and <em>dukkhatā</em>,
is narrower than that of the last, <em>anattatā</em>. This is summarized as
follows:</p>
<p>The characteristics of impermanence and <em>dukkha</em> apply only to
conditioned phenomena (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) – and to all conditioned phenomena.
The characteristic of nonself, however, applies to all things, both the
conditioned and the Unconditioned. The Unconditioned – Nibbāna – is
devoid of the first two characteristics.</p>
<p>In the Pali Canon the Buddha characterizes the conditioned and the
Unconditioned in this way:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Signs of the conditioned world (<em>saṅkhata-lakkhaṇa</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Origination is apparent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disintegration is apparent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alteration is apparent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Signs of the Unconditioned (<em>asaṅkhata-lakkhaṇa</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Origination is not apparent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disintegration is not apparent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alteration is not apparent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To sum up, the Unconditioned, or Nibbāna, is beyond impermanence and
<em>dukkha</em>, but it is selfless. As for everything else, that is, all
formations, they are impermanent, <em>dukkha</em>, and nonself, as this passage
from the Vinaya Piṭaka confirms:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>All formations are impermanent, subject to stress, and nonself;
Nibbāna and designations are nonself.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup> {68}</p>

<p>There are many examples in the Thai language of a single word having
several definitions.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup> Some definitions vary only slightly while
others vary greatly to the point of appearing unrelated.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Pali there are many individual terms that have a wide
range of different meanings. Those people who have studied Pali are able
to distinguish and understand these different meanings, even in the case
where the word appears several times in a single passage but with
different connotations. Such words include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Nāga</em>: this term can mean a divine serpent, a battle elephant, or
an excellent person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nimitta</em>: in the Vinaya<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup> this term refers to a boundary marker,
while in relation to meditation it means a mental image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nikāya</em>: this term refers to a section of the Suttanta Piṭaka;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup>
in other contexts it means a religious faction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paccaya</em>: in the Vinaya this term means a basic requisite, for
instance, food, while in Dhamma teachings it refers more generally
to a ‘cause’ or ‘support’.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the following words as found in different Buddhist texts:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A person knows the <em>rasa</em> with the tongue; delicious or not, he does
not allow desire or repulsion to overwhelm the mind. Such a person
guards the <em>indriya</em> of the tongue.</p>
<p>The <em>indriya</em> of faith, as <em>rasa</em>, causes all accompanying qualities
to be radiant, like a water-purifying gem.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the first passage <em>rasa</em> means ‘a taste’ and <em>indriya</em> refers to the
internal sense base. In the latter passage <em>rasa</em> means a ‘function’,
while <em>indriya</em> refers to a spiritual faculty. {69}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A monk should perform yoga to realize the state that is free from
yoga.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The first <em>yoga</em> means ‘spiritual effort’: the development of wisdom.
The second <em>yoga</em> refers to the defilements that bind beings to the
suffering in worldly existence.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup></p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>An ordinary person regards the body, feelings, perceptions, volitional
formations (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) and consciousness as self, but these five
aggregates cannot be self, because all conditioned phenomena
(<em>saṅkhāra</em>) are impermanent, subject to pressure, and not-self.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The first <em>saṅkhāra</em> refers solely to one of the five aggregates,
whereas the second <em>saṅkhāra</em> covers all conditioned things in keeping
with the Three Characteristics.</p>
<p>The word that needs explaining here is <em>saṅkhāra</em>. The list of examples
was given simply to demonstrate the important fact that in Pali there
are many cases of the same word having two or more distinct meanings, of
varying disparity; they can be dissimilar or even contradictory. If one
understands this then one does not consider it strange to find the word
<em>saṅkhāra</em> being used in the texts in many different senses, and one
learns to distinguish the meaning accordingly.</p>
<p>The word <em>saṅkhāra</em> has at least four definitions, but there are two in
particular that need to be understood. These are <em>saṅkhāra</em> as one of
the Five Aggregates and <em>saṅkhāra</em> of the Three Characteristics. Because
these two definitions of <em>saṅkhāra</em> overlap, they can cause confusion.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Five Aggregates: <em>rūpa</em>, <em>vedanā</em>, <em>saññā</em>, <em>saṅkhāra</em>,
<em>viññāṇa</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Three Characteristics: all <em>saṅkhāra</em> are impermanent, all
<em>saṅkhāra</em> are <em>dukkha</em>, all <em>dhamma</em> are nonself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Saṅkhāra</em> as the fourth component of the five aggregates refers to
mental factors that shape the mind as wholesome, unwholesome, or
neutral. They are the mental qualities led by intention (<em>cetanā</em>) that
mould and influence thoughts and consequent physical action. They are
the agents behind action (<em>kamma</em>), the ‘fashioners’ of the mind, for
example: faith (<em>saddhā</em>), mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), moral shame (<em>hiri</em>),
fear of wrongdoing (<em>ottappa</em>), lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>), compassion
(<em>karuṇā</em>), wisdom (<em>paññā</em>), delusion (<em>moha</em>), greed (<em>lobha</em>) and
hatred (<em>dosa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup> They are mental qualities (<em>nāma-dhamma</em>),
existing in the mind along with feeling (<em>vedanā</em>), perception
(<em>saññā</em>), and consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>).</p>
<p><em>Saṅkhāra</em> of the Three Characteristics refers to constructed things:
everything that arises from causes and conditioning factors, regardless
of material or immaterial, physical or mental, live or inanimate,
internal or external. They are also called <em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>. <em>Saṅkhāra</em>
here includes everything except Nibbāna.</p>
<p><em>Saṅkhāra</em> of the Five Aggregates has a more limited meaning than
<em>saṅkhāra</em> of the Three Characteristics; it refers to one part of
<em>saṅkhāra</em> of the Three Characteristics. {70} <em>Saṅkhāra</em> of the Five
Aggregates refers to the agents that determine the quality of the mind,
or ‘volitional formations’. As for <em>saṅkhāra</em> of the Three
Characteristics, it refers to compounded things: things constructed by
conditioning factors, or simply ‘formations’. Because volitional
formations are themselves constructed things, they are not excluded from
the all-inclusive meaning of <em>saṅkhāra</em> of the Three Characteristics.</p>
<p>Using the model of the Five Aggregates, one can divide conditioned
phenomena into mind and matter, and subdivide the mind into four
sub-groups – feeling, perception, volitional formations (<em>saṅkhāra</em>),
and consciousness. Here, <em>saṅkhāra</em> is solely a mental component and
just one element of four. <em>Saṅkhāra</em> of the Three Characteristics,
however, covers both mind and matter. Therefore, <em>saṅkhāra</em> (of the five
aggregates) is one kind of <em>saṅkhāra</em> (of the Three Characteristics).</p>
<p>Accordingly, the statements: <em>Physical form is impermanent, feeling is
impermanent, perception is impermanent, volitional formations</em>
(<em>saṅkhāra</em>) <em>are impermanent, and consciousness is impermanent</em>, and:
<em>All conditioned phenomena</em> (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) <em>are impermanent</em> are identical
in meaning.</p>
<p>The texts occasionally use the term <em>saṅkhāra-khandha</em> for <em>saṅkhara</em> of
the Five Aggregates, and <em>saṅkhata-saṅkhāra</em>, or simply <em>saṅkhāra</em>, for
<em>saṅkhāra</em> of the Three Characteristics. The reason these two teachings
use the same term, <em>saṅkhāra</em>, is that they describe conditions with
similar meanings, having to do with ‘formation’.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#scriptural-definitions" id="scriptural-definitions">Scriptural Definitions</a></h2>
<p>The teachings on the five aggregates (<em>pañca-khandha</em>) in chapter 1, and
on the six sense bases (<em>saḷāyatana</em>) in chapter 2, emphasize the
internal life of human beings. The teaching of the Three Characteristics
expands the scope of investigation to cover both the individual person
and external objects. It is a study of human beings and the entire
world. {73}</p>
<p>The meaning of each of the three characteristics has already been
described in a rudimentary way. At this point they will be analyzed in
more detail, based on scriptural teachings.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#impermanence" id="impermanence">Impermanence</a></h3>
<p>The Paṭisambhidāmagga offers a simple definition for <em>aniccatā</em>:
something is considered impermanent ‘in the sense that it perishes’
(<em>khaya-aṭṭhena</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup> All conditioned things exist only momentarily,
at a specific time and place, then cease there and then. An object in
the past does not exist in the present; an object present now does not
exist in the future. Things do not endure in any fixed, immutable way.</p>
<p>Post-canonical texts expand on this definition and offer a range of
explanations. For example, at first glance, one sees that a person’s
life begins at birth and ends at death. Upon closer inspection, one
notices an accelerating rate of birth and decline, of an age period, a
year, a season, a month, a day, a few minutes, to the rise and fall of
each moment, which is difficult for most people to discern.</p>
<p>Modern scientific discoveries, not least in physics, have helped to
reveal and demonstrate impermanence. Many scientific theories, say of
the birth and death of stars or of atomic disintegration, illustrate the
law of impermanence.</p>
<p>The commentaries define <em>aniccatā</em> in many different ways. For example,
something is considered impermanent ‘because it is uncertain and
unstable’ (<em>aniccantikatāya</em>), and ‘because it has a beginning and an
end’ (<em>ādi-antavantatāya</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup> A common and frequently used definition
is: something is considered impermanent in the sense that ‘it has
existed and then ceases to exist’ (<em>hutvā abhāvaṭṭhena</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup>
Additional wording is sometimes added to this phrase, for example:
something is considered impermanent ‘because it arises, passes away, and
becomes otherwise’ (<em>uppādavayaññathattabhāvā hutvā abhāvato vā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>A detailed list of definitions is as follows. There are four reasons why
something is considered impermanent:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup> {74}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Uppādavayappavattito</em>: because it arises and disintegrates; it
rises and ceases; it exists and then ceases to exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vipariṇāmato</em>: because it is subject to change; it is continually
altered and transformed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tāvakālikato</em>: because it is temporary; it exists momentarily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Niccapaṭikkhepato</em>: because it is inconsistent with permanence; the
changeability of a conditioned object is inherently in conflict with
permanence; when one accurately observes the object no permanence is
found; even if someone tries to regard it as permanent, it refuses
to accommodate that person’s wishes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="header" href="#dukkha" id="dukkha">Dukkha</a></h3>
<h4><a class="header" href="#introduction-1" id="introduction-1">Introduction</a></h4>
<p>The Paṭisambhidāmagga offers a concise definition for <em>dukkhatā</em>:
something is considered <em>dukkha</em> ‘in the sense that it is subject to
danger’ (<em>bhaya-aṭṭhena</em>)<em>.</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup> <em>Bhaya</em> can also mean ‘dangerous’ or
‘frightening’. All conditioned phenomena invariably disintegrate and
dissolve; they therefore offer no true safety, relief, or assurance. Any
such phenomenon is threatened by destruction and disintegration. The
object thus creates danger – both fear and a peril – for anyone who
attaches to it.</p>
<p>The commentaries elaborate the meaning of <em>dukkhatā</em>, including these
two frequently used definitions: first, something is considered <em>dukkha</em>
‘in the sense that it is under perpetual pressure through arising and
disintegration’ (<em>uppādavaya-paṭipīḷanaṭṭhena</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup> or
<em>uppādavaya-paṭipīḷanatāya</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup>). There is pressure on everything that
interacts with that object, and the object itself is under stress from
its component elements.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup> Second, ‘because it is a foundation for
suffering’ (<em>dukkha-vatthutāya</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn30">30</a></sup> or <em>dukkha-vatthuto</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup>). An
object beset by <em>dukkha</em> is a basis for suffering, for example by
causing pain. Simply speaking, <em>dukkha</em> means to cause pain.</p>
<p>The most complete compilation of definitions for <em>dukkha</em> in the
commentaries is as follows. Something is considered to be <em>dukkha</em> for
these four reasons:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Abhiṇha-sampatipīḷanato</em>: because it is continually oppressed; it
is subject to constant pressure due to arising and dissolution;
there is persistent friction amongst component parts or amongst
associated conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkhamato</em>: because it is ‘hard to endure’; it is not durable; it
is unable to be sustained in an original state; it is obliged to
change, become otherwise, and lose identity, as a consequence of
arising and ceasing.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup> {75}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkha-vatthuto</em>: because it is a foundation for suffering; it is
foundation for a state of pressure and stress. In relation to human
beings, this means that it produces various kinds of affliction,
e.g. pain, discomfort and distress.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn34">34</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sukha-paṭikkhepato</em>: because it opposes pleasure (<em>sukha</em>;
‘happiness’). The natural conditions of pressure, friction, and
instability oppose or obstruct ease and comfort. In order to obtain
pleasure, people must strive to regulate certain factors.
Essentially, pleasure exists only as a feeling (<em>vedanā</em>). The basic
condition is that of <em>dukkha</em> – pressure, tension and friction –
which is an attribute of all formations.</p>
<p>In relation to human beings, this natural characteristic of <em>dukkha</em>
produces feelings of oppression and stress, which we call ‘pain’
(<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>). The reduction of pressure, or the freedom from
pain, we call ‘pleasure’ or ‘happiness’. The greater the discomfort
(duress, deprivation, yearning, hunger, etc.), the greater the
happiness when one is released from it. For example, a person who
moves from the hot sun into the shade feels refreshed and cool.
Likewise, a person experiencing great pleasure (<em>sukha-vedanā</em>) will
experience a similarly strong discomfort (<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>) when the
pleasurable circumstances are disturbed. Even small amounts of
discomfort, which are normally not felt as such, may be a torment. A
person leaving a comfortably warm room into the cold, for example,
may find the temperature extreme, even though those around him are
not bothered.</p>
<p>Happiness, or a pleasurable feeling (<em>sukha-vedanā</em>), is not an end
of <em>dukkha</em>. We call an increase or reduction of pressure
‘happiness’ because it creates a feeling of pleasure. But an
alteration of this pleasurable tension results in a condition that
requires endurance or is intolerable, a condition we call
‘suffering’, i.e. we feel pain (<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>). In truth only
<em>dukkha</em> – pressure and stress – exists, which either increases or
decreases.</p>
<p>A similar subject is that of heat and cold. Cold does not really
exist; there exists only a feeling of cold. The basic condition is
heat, which increases, decreases, or is absent. When one says that
one is pleasantly cool, one is referring only to a feeling;
actually, one is experiencing a degree of heat. If more or less warm
than that degree, then one is not at ease. In this sense, pleasure,
or to speak in full ‘a feeling of pleasure’, is one level of
<em>dukkha</em>. Pleasure is dependent on pressure and tension, and
necessarily changes and vanishes. In other words, <em>dukkha</em>, which is
the basic condition, prevents pleasure from being sustainable. {76}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As quoted above, the Paṭisambhidāmagga defines <em>dukkha</em> in the context
of the Three Characteristics as ‘subject to danger’. In the section
explaining the Four Noble Truths (<em>ariya-sacca</em>), it defines <em>dukkha</em> –
the first of the Noble Truths – in four ways. Something is identified
as <em>dukkha</em> in the sense that it is oppressed (<em>pīḷanaṭṭha</em>),
constructed (<em>saṅkhataṭṭha</em>), burns (<em>santāpaṭṭha</em>), and changes
(<em>vipariṇāmaṭṭha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn35">35</a></sup> These four definitions of <em>dukkha</em> can also be
used in the context of the Three Characteristics. Definitions one and
four (<em>pīḷanaṭṭha</em> and <em>vipariṇāmaṭṭha</em>) have already been
described;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn36">36</a></sup> here are the other two:</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <em>Saṅkhataṭṭha</em>: ‘in the sense that it is fashioned (<em>saṅkhata</em>)’; it
is constructed by conditioning factors; it depends on such factors;
it is inconstant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <em>Santāpaṭṭha</em>: ‘in the sense that it burns’; it burns up, ending in
decay and destruction; moreover, it burns someone with defilements,
who grasps and clings to the object, causing torment and
agitation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn37">37</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4><a class="header" href="#dukkha-in-the-three-characteristics-and-dukkha-in-the-four-noble-truths" id="dukkha-in-the-three-characteristics-and-dukkha-in-the-four-noble-truths">Dukkha in the Three Characteristics and Dukkha in the Four Noble Truths</a></h4>
<p><strong>1. Primary Classifications of Dukkha:</strong> Although this chapter is
dedicated to the subject of the Three Characteristics (<em>anicca</em>,
<em>dukkha</em>, &amp; <em>anattā</em>), the discussion of <em>dukkha</em> in this context is
invariably linked to other teachings pertaining to this term. This is
especially true in relation to <em>dukkha</em> as part of the Four Noble
Truths. Unless this relationship is well understood, it may cause
confusion.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, the <em>dukkha</em> of the Three Characteristics, which is a
condition inherent in nature, in some circumstances becomes the <em>dukkha</em>
of the Four Noble Truths. When people lack an understanding of this
primary, naturally-occurring <em>dukkha</em> and deal with it inappropriately,
it turns into a personal problem.</p>
<p>The very characteristic of <em>dukkha</em> implies that conditioned things are
under stress and are unable to sustain themselves in an original shape.
When people lack discernment of this natural condition and things do not
proceed according to their desires, then dissatisfaction, stress, and
affliction arise in their hearts. This is the genesis of <em>dukkha</em> as
outlined in the Four Noble Truths.</p>
<p>In other words, the <em>dukkha</em> of the Three Characteristics is an aspect
of nature; it is not possible to cancel or abolish it. One needs to
develop wisdom in order to fully understand it, and in terms of conduct,
one needs to act according to causes and conditions.</p>
<p><em>Dukkha</em> of the Four Noble Truths, however, we are able to do away with,
to put an end to. This is possible by applying wisdom and by skilfully
engaging with the <em>dukkha</em> of the Three Characteristics – the <em>dukkha</em>
inherent in conditioned phenomena.</p>
<p>The term <em>dukkha</em> appears in another context, referring to the feeling
of dis-ease or pain (<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>). This term is part of a threefold
division, including <em>sukha-vedanā</em> (the feeling of ease; physical &amp;
mental pleasure) and <em>adukkhamasukha-vedanā</em> (neutral feeling; also
referred to as <em>upekkhā</em>). This form of <em>dukkha</em> is also connected to
the <em>dukkha</em> of the Three Characteristics. Because it pertains to
feeling or sensation, which is experienced by people immediately, it is
easily understood, almost without needing to apply any intelligence.
When a branch falls on one’s head, one encounters a natural form of
<em>dukkha</em> and one experiences pain. Sometimes this pain is almost
unendurable.</p>
<p>This kind of <em>dukkha</em> is often easy to rectify. One seeks out a doctor,
who stitches the wound and applies antiseptic. One then waits till the
wound heals, and the matter is finished. {77}</p>
<p>But if one fails to recognize that the branch fell naturally by its own
accord, one may become suspicious of others, thinking: ‘Who is
harbouring thoughts of ill-will, and has intentionally thrown this
branch at me to hurt or kill me?’</p>
<p>This suspicion gives rise to anger, disquietude, and a deep sense of
affliction. These thoughts are accompanied by more sensations of
displeasure (<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>), but the deeper problem rests with the
suffering that is a matter of <em>dukkha</em> of the Four Noble Truths. The
issue may then become intensified and protracted. The suffering (of the
Four Noble Truths) deepens and escalates the discomfort (as a
sensation), sometimes without end.</p>
<p>This matter of <em>dukkha</em> in the Four Noble Truths is highly significant.
It causes all sorts of problems, up to and including warfare. One can
say that this form of <em>dukkha</em> epitomizes the human predicament.</p>
<p>Nature on its own contains only the <em>dukkha</em> of the Three
Characteristics. But when human beings become involved, all three forms
of <em>dukkha</em> – <em>dukkha</em> of the Three Characteristics, <em>dukkha</em> of
sensation, and <em>dukkha</em> of the Four Noble Truths – merge forces.</p>
<p>In sum, <em>dukkha</em> appears in three key teachings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On feeling/sensation (two versions):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Three <em>vedanā</em>: painful feeling (dukkha), pleasant feeling
(<em>sukha</em>), and neutral feeling (<em>adukkham-asukha</em> or <em>upekkhā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five <em>vedanā</em>: painful physical feeling (dukkha), pleasurable
physical feeling (<em>sukha</em>), painful mental feeling
(<em>domanassa</em>), pleasurable mental feeling (<em>somanassa</em>), and
neutral feeling (<em>upekkhā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Its complete name in this context is <em>dukkha-vedanā</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Three Characteristics: <em>anicca</em>, dukkha and <em>anattā</em>. In this
context its complete name is <em>dukkha-lakkhaṇa</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Four Noble Truths: dukkha, <em>samudaya</em> (’origin’), <em>nirodha</em>
(’cessation’) and <em>magga</em> (’path’). Its complete name is
<em>dukkha-ariyasacca</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The definitions of <em>dukkha</em> in these three groups overlap; they are
different aspects of one truth.</p>
<p>The <em>dukkha</em> with the broadest meaning and is all-inclusive is <em>dukkha</em>
of the Three Characteristics, also referred to as <em>dukkha-lakkhaṇa</em> or
<em>dukkhatā</em>. This is the condition of instability, the inability to be
sustained in an original shape, due to the pressure, stress and friction
from rising and disintegration, as explained above. It is a
characteristic of all conditioned phenomena (<em>sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā</em>),
encompassing the same range as impermanence: whatever is impermanent is
also <em>dukkha</em> (<em>yad’aniccaṃ taṃ dukkhaṃ</em>).</p>
<p>The <em>dukkha</em> with the most restricted meaning, and is simply a
consequence of the <em>dukkha</em> of the Three Characteristics, is <em>dukkha</em> as
feeling, called <em>dukkha-vedanā</em>: a feeling of pain. It is a feeling
occurring when pressure reaches a certain level in relation to a
person’s body and mind.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn38">38</a></sup> This pain is included in the <em>dukkha</em> of
the Three Characteristics, as is all other feeling, both pleasant and
neutral. All kinds of feeling – painful, pleasurable, and neutral –
are <em>dukkha</em> as determined by the Three Characteristics. {78}</p>
<p><em>Dukkha</em> in the Four Noble Truths (<em>dukkha-ariyasacca</em>) is precisely the
<em>dukkha</em> of the Three Characteristics, which becomes the foundation or
source of human difficulties. Yet these difficulties are created by
people themselves.</p>
<p>All formations are under stress, which is the <em>dukkha</em> of the Three
Characteristics. These formations (not all of them and not always) cause
suffering for human beings who lack understanding and relate to things
inappropriately; this suffering is the <em>dukkha</em> of the Four Noble
Truths. (These phenomena are oppressive, however, because they
themselves are subject to stress, and therefore it is impossible for
them to provide true satisfaction to people in any constant or
consistent way.)</p>
<p><em>Dukkha-ariyasacca</em> refers specifically to matters connected to the five
aggregates of clinging (<em>upādāna-khandha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn39">39</a></sup> Technically, the
<em>dukkha</em> of the Four Noble Truths refers specifically to the suffering
arising on account of the sense bases (<em>indriya-baddha</em>), i.e. suffering
that pertains to everyday life. It excludes pressure independent of the
sense bases (<em>anindriya-baddha</em>), which is classified as <em>dukkha</em> of the
Three Characteristics but not of the Noble Truths.</p>
<p>(Note that <em>dukkha-ariyasacca</em> is <em>dukkha</em> of the Three Characteristics.
<em>Samudaya</em> – the cause of suffering – and <em>magga</em> – the Eightfold
Path – are as well, as they are naturally occurring conditioned
phenomena, but they are not <em>dukkha-ariyasacca</em>.)</p>
<p>The scope of <em>dukkha</em> in the Four Noble Truths is determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkha</em> as the first noble truth is associated with human life and
human problems. It arises as a result of the sense faculties
(<em>indriyabaddha</em>); it does not include <em>dukkha</em> independent of the
sense faculties (<em>anindriyabaddha</em>). It is not the <em>dukkha</em>
mentioned in the passages ‘all conditioned phenomena are <em>dukkha</em>’
(<em>sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā</em>), and ‘whatever is impermanent is <em>dukkha</em>’
(<em>yad’aniccaṃ taṃ dukkhaṃ</em>), which refer to the all-inclusive
<em>dukkha</em> of the Three Characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It originates from a person’s defiled action (<em>kamma-kilesa</em>). It is
a result of <em>dukkha-samudaya</em>; it is a result of craving – <em>taṇhā</em>.
It refers specifically to matters connected to the five aggregates
of clinging (<em>upādāna-khandha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the focus of the duty (<em>kicca</em>) related to the first noble
truth: <em>pariññā-kicca</em>. <em>Pariññā</em> is comprehension or knowledge of
things as they truly are. To acquire knowledge of and to fully
understand personal problems is our responsibility vis-à-vis
<em>dukkha</em> of the Four Noble Truths. <em>Dukkha</em> here is confined to this
subject of understanding human suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It emphasizes the significance of the basis of suffering
(<em>dukkha-vatthutāya</em>) rather than the pressure, tension and friction
of arising and falling (<em>udayabbaya-paṭipīḷanaṭṭhena</em>), which is the
essential meaning of <em>dukkha</em> in the Three Characteristics.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn40">40</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The subject of <em>dukkha</em> in the Four Noble Truths will be explained at
more length below. Here, let us examine another teaching, on the three
kinds of <em>dukkha</em> (the 3 <em>dukkhatā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup> This is a very important
teaching located in three different suttas; it also occurs frequently in
the Mahāniddesa and the Cūḷaniddesa. On one occasion it was taught by
the Buddha; the remaining passages are by Ven. Sāriputta. In each
passage, however, only the three factors are listed, without any
explanation (most likely this set of three factors was an important
concept during the Buddha’s time). The following description relies on
the explanations provided in the commentaries. (The order of these
factors here also accords with the normal order of the commentaries; the
order in the suttas is: <em>dukkha-dukkhatā</em>, <em>saṅkhāra-dukkhatā</em> &amp;
<em>vipariṇāma-dukkhatā</em>.) {79}</p>
<p>The teaching on the 3 <em>dukkhatā</em> defines <em>dukkha</em> in the context of the
Three Characteristics. It includes <em>dukkha</em> as a feeling (<em>vedanā</em>), and
it also links up with <em>dukkha</em> as found in the Four Noble Truths:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkha-dukkhatā</em>:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn42">42</a></sup> physical and mental pain, as generally
understood, for example aches, discomfort, and fatigue; in other
words, ‘painful feeling’ (<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vipariṇāma-dukkhatā</em>: <em>dukkha</em> resulting from or inherent in
change. This refers to pleasurable feeling (<em>sukha-vedanā</em>), which
in truth is a degree of <em>dukkha</em>. Pleasure is equal to concealed
pain, or always has pain furtively in pursuit. Once a feeling of
pleasure changes, it transforms into a feeling of pain. In other
words, the fundamental inconstancy of pleasure produces pain.
(Another explanation is that pleasure <em>is</em> pain, of a particular
degree.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Saṅkhāra-dukkhatā</em>:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn43">43</a></sup> <em>dukkha</em> inherent in conditioned
phenomena, inherent in everything that originates from causes and
conditions. In other words, the five aggregates are <em>dukkha</em>; they
are of the nature to be pressured and coerced by the rising and
decay of opposing factors, preventing them from remaining in a
stable, original state. This third kind of <em>dukkha</em> comprises the
<em>dukkha</em> of the Three Characteristics.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. The Three Universal Characteristics Act as a Basis for Dukkha in
the Four Noble Truths:</strong> As described earlier, the <em>dukkha</em> of the Three
Characteristics refers to the conflict and stress inherent in
conditioned phenomena, preventing them from any lasting stability. All
conditioned things – all things that ordinary people know and
experience – are subject to this characteristic. Another way of
phrasing this is that this pressure and stress is a natural
characteristic of the five aggregates (<em>khandha</em>).</p>
<p>Every human being, and everything that ordinary people come into contact
with, is a conditioned phenomenon and is comprised of the five
aggregates. If people lack understanding and deal with things
unskilfully, a sense of oppression and affliction arises within
themselves, which we call ‘suffering’. This suffering experienced by
people is the <em>dukkha</em> of the Four Noble Truths. Although it is real for
these people, it is not a universal characteristic of all things.</p>
<p>Isolating this <em>dukkha</em> of the Three Characteristics is convenient in
one sense, but it should not be completely removed from the other two
characteristics. That is, one should recognize that all conditioned
things are subject to three universal characteristics: impermanence
(<em>anicca</em>; having arisen, things dissolve and disappear); stress
(<em>dukkha</em>; all conditions or factors that constitute or associate with
something are under pressure and unable to sustain an original shape);
and nonself (<em>anattā</em>; things exist according to causes and conditions;
things do not possess a ‘self’ or a distinct, abiding essence that is
able to own or control things).</p>
<p>In short, all conditioned things are unstable, unreliable, and
unenduring.</p>
<p>The arising of suffering (<em>dukkha</em>) in the Four Noble Truths is not
simply due to the stress (<em>dukkha</em>) outlined in the Three
Characteristics. Indeed, all three characteristics – <em>anicca</em>, <em>dukkha</em>
&amp; <em>anattā</em> – act as a basis for suffering in those individuals who lack
a true understanding of them. {80}</p>
<p>All conditioned things (or the five aggregates), including the entirety
of what makes up human beings – the body and the mind – are
impermanent, subject to stress, and nonself. It is in their nature to be
marked by these three characteristics, without any interference by human
beings. For this reason the Three Characteristics are distinct from the
Four Noble Truths (even though both of these teachings share the factor
of <em>dukkha</em>).</p>
<p>So at what stage do the five aggregates become part of the <em>dukkha</em>
described in the Four Noble Truths? The answer is when they become the
five aggregates of clinging (<em>upādāna-khandha</em>).</p>
<p>The five aggregates of clinging (<em>upādāna-khandha</em>) are precisely these
same five aggregates, but here they are grasped onto or cherished by
clinging (<em>upādāna</em>). Technically speaking, they are ‘accompanied by
mental taints (<em>āsava</em>) and act as a basis for clinging (<em>upādāna</em>).’
One can define this term <em>upādāna-khandha</em> as the five aggregates born
of clinging, the five aggregates as the point of obsession for clinging,
or the five aggregates as the focus of attention for clinging. They
pertain directly to ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>), craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), and
clinging (<em>upādāna</em>). This is what is being referred to in the first
noble truth.</p>
<p>In the following teaching, the Buddha distinguishes between the five
aggregates and the five aggregates of clinging:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, I will teach you the five aggregates and the five aggregates
subject to clinging. Listen attentively.</p>
<p>And what are the five aggregates? Whatever kind of form ... feeling
... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness there is,
whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or
subtle, inferior or superior, far or near.... These are called the
five aggregates.</p>
<p>And what are the five aggregates of clinging? Whatever kind of form
... feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness
there is, whether past, future, or present, internal or external,
gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, that is
accompanied by mental taints (<em>sāsava</em>), that is a foundation for
clinging (<em>upādāniya</em>).... These are called the five aggregates of
clinging.</p>
<p><em>S. III. 47-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When the Buddha taught the Three Characteristics, he would invariably
state that the five aggregates are impermanent, subject to stress, and
nonself. The true nature of form, feeling, perception, volitional
formations, and consciousness is marked by these three characteristics.
He did not state that the five aggregates of clinging are impermanent,
subject to stress, and nonself, because these are already included in
the wider classification of the five aggregates. The important point
here is that by grasping to the five aggregates, they develop into the
five aggregates of clinging and this grasping leads to suffering.</p>
<p>The following is a teaching on the five aggregates in relation to the
Three Characteristics:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, form is impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perception is
impermanent, volitional formations are impermanent, consciousness is
impermanent....</p>
<p>Monks, form is dukkha (it is under stress by its conditioning factors;
it is unsustainable) ... feeling ... perception ... volitional
formations ... consciousness is dukkha....</p>
<p>Monks, form is not-self ... feeling ... perception ... volitional
formations ... consciousness is not-self.... Seeing this, the
instructed noble disciple lets go of form ... feeling ... perception
... volitional formations ... consciousness. Letting go,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn44">44</a></sup> he
extricates himself.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn45">45</a></sup> Through dispassion [his mind] is liberated.
When it is liberated there come the knowledge: ‘It is liberated’. He
understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what
had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of
being.’ {81}</p>
<p><em>S. III. 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When one clearly understands conditioned things according to the Three
Characteristics, the five aggregates of clinging do not arise, or they
cease to exist. Instead, one experiences freedom, luminosity, joy, and
an end of suffering.</p>
<p>In the sutta on Turning the Wheel of Dhamma (Dhammacakkapavattana
Sutta), which was given to the group of five disciples
(<em>pañca-vaggiya</em>), the Buddha gives a lengthy description of <em>dukkha</em>,
the first noble truth. This first noble truth may be defined as:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Now this, monks, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering,
aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering; union
with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what is
pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in
brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 421-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The ending phrase, ‘in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging
are suffering’ – <em>saṅkhittena pañcupādānakkhandhā dukkhā</em>) – is the
gist of this passage. That is, all the previous statements are summed up
by this ending phrase.</p>
<p>The Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta was the first sutta taught by the Buddha
– no one had heard this teaching before this occasion. The group of
five disciples would not have been familiar with how the term <em>dukkha</em>
is defined in Buddhism. We can compare this with how the Buddha taught
the first noble truth on later occasions.</p>
<p>At one time in Sāvatthi (indicating that this event occurred a long time
after the first sermon), the Buddha explained the Four Noble Truths to
the bhikkhus (who would have had a foundation of understanding). Here,
in relation to the first noble truth, the Buddha focuses exclusively on
the five aggregates of clinging:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, I will teach you suffering, the origin of suffering, the
cessation of suffering, and the way leading to the cessation of
suffering. Listen carefully.</p>
<p>And what, monks, is suffering? It should be said: the five aggregates
subject to clinging. What five? The form aggregate subject to
clinging, the feeling aggregate subject to clinging, the perception
aggregate subject to clinging, the volitional formations aggregate
subject to clinging, the consciousness aggregate subject to clinging.
This is called suffering.</p>
<p>And what monks, is the origin of suffering? It is this craving that
leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking
delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual pleasures,
craving for existence, craving for extermination. This is called the
origin of suffering.</p>
<p>And what, monks, is the cessation of suffering? It is the
remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the
giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on
it. This is called the cessation of suffering. {82}</p>
<p>And what, monks is the way leading to the cessation of suffering? It
is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right thought,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration. This is called the way leading
to the cessation of suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn46">46</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. III. 158-9; S. V. 425</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>From this passage we can conclude that the many examples the Buddha used
to describe suffering in the First Sermon refer to conditions or
situations related to suffering that general people are familiar with.
After establishing a basic understanding of the subject matter, the
Buddha went on to describe the gist of suffering: the five aggregates of
clinging. Had he not provided common examples of suffering first, the
listeners, who lacked a foundation of understanding, would have been at
a loss.</p>
<p>In other circumstances, or in other Dhamma teachings, the Buddha may
very well have presented other familiar examples of suffering to his
listeners. Whichever examples the Buddha may have used, however, he
would have eventually summed up human suffering as the five aggregates
of clinging.</p>
<p>Note this teaching by the Buddha connected to the Four Noble Truths:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, in reference to the statement declared by me: ‘This is the
noble truth of suffering’, there are innumerable nuances, innumerable
meanings, innumerable interpretations.... In reference to the
statement declared by me: ‘This is the noble truth of the path leading
to the end of suffering’, there are innumerable nuances, innumerable
meanings, innumerable interpretations.</p>
<p>Therefore, monks, you should strive in order to understand according
to the truth: ‘This is suffering ... this is the path leading to the
end of suffering.’</p>
<p><em>S. V. 430.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This passage confirms that all of the Buddha’s teachings (the entirety
of Buddha-Dhamma) can be summed up by or included in the teaching of the
Four Noble Truths. Although some teachings do not specifically refer to
the Four Noble Truths, they are still encapsulated by this key teaching.
The following quotation from the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha Sutta, which
describes the suffering and harmful effects of craving for sensual
pleasures (<em>kāma-taṇhā</em>), along with describing a wholesome stage of
practice on the noble way (<em>ariya-magga</em>) towards the final stage of
cessation (<em>nirodha</em>), is a case in point:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>See here, Mahānāma, before my awakening, while I was still only an
unawakened bodhisatta, I too clearly saw as it actually is with proper
wisdom how sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much
suffering, and much despair, and how great is the danger in them. But
as long as I still did not attain to the rapture and pleasure that are
apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, or to
something more peaceful than that, I could not declare to be one who
would not return in pursuit of sensual pleasures. Yet when I clearly
saw as it actually is with proper wisdom how sensual pleasures provide
little gratification, much suffering, and much despair, and how great
is the danger in them, and I attained to the rapture and pleasure that
are apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome states, or to
something more peaceful than that, I could declare to be one who would
not return in pursuit of sensual pleasures. {83}</p>
<p>And what, Mahānāma, is the gratification (advantage) in the case of
sensual pleasures? There are these five cords of sensual pleasure.
What are the five? Forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for,
desired, agreeable, and pleasant, that are inviting and provocative of
lust. Sounds cognizable by the ear ... odours cognizable by the nose
... flavours cognizable by the tongue ... tangibles cognizable by the
body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, and pleasant, that are
inviting and provocative of lust. These are the five cords of sensual
pleasure. Now the pleasure and joy that arises dependent on these five
cords of sensual pleasure is the gratification in the case of sensual
pleasures.</p>
<p>And what, Mahānāma, is the danger (disadvantage) in the case of
sensual pleasure? Here, on account of the craft by which a clansman
makes a living – whether counting or accounting or calculating or
farming or trading or husbandry or archery or the royal service, or
whatever craft it may be – he has to face cold, he has to face heat,
he is plagued by contact with horseflies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and
creeping things; he risks death by hunger and thirst. Now this is a
danger in the case of sensual pleasures, a mass of suffering visible
here and now, having sensual pleasures as its cause, sensual pleasures
as its source, sensual pleasures as its requirement, the cause being
simply sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>If no wealth comes to the clansman while he works and strives and
makes an effort thus, he sorrows, grieves, and laments, he weeps
beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying: ‘My work is in
vain, my effort is fruitless!’ Now this too is a danger in the case of
sensual pleasure ... the cause being simply sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>If wealth comes to the clansman while he works and strives and makes
an effort thus, he experiences pain and anguish in protecting it: ‘How
shall neither kings confiscate it, nor thieves plunder it, nor fire
burn it, nor water sweep it way, nor hateful heirs make off and
squander it?’</p>
<p>And as he guards and protects his wealth, kings confiscate it, or
thieves plunder it, or fire burns it, or floods sweep it away, or
hateful heirs make off and squander it. And he sorrows, grieves, and
laments, he weeps beating his breast and becomes distraught, crying:
‘What I had I have no longer! My previous possessions are no longer
mine!’ Now this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasure ...
the cause being simply sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause, sensual pleasures as the
source, sensual pleasures as the requirement, the cause being simply
sensual pleasures, kings quarrel with kings, nobles with nobles,
brahmans with brahmans, householders with householders; mother
quarrels with child, child with mother, father with child, child with
father; brother quarrels with brother, sister with sister, brother
with sister, friend with friend. And here in their quarrels, disputes,
and arguments they attack each other with fists, clods of earth,
sticks, or knives, whereby they incur death or deadly suffering. Now
this too is a danger in the case of sensual pleasure ... the cause
being simply sensual pleasures. {84}</p>
<p>Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... men take up swords and
shields and buckle on bows and quivers, and they march off to war,
both sides engaging in pitched battles. With arrows flying, spears
hurled, and swords flashing, some of these soldiers are pierced by
arrows, some are lanced by spears, some have their heads cut off by
swords, whereby they incur death or deadly suffering. Now this too
is a danger in the case of sensual pleasure ... the cause being simply
sensual pleasures.</p>
<p>Again, with sensual pleasures as the cause ... men take up swords and
shields and buckle on bows and quivers, and they charge bastions
coated in hot mud. With arrows flying, spears hurled, and swords
flashing, some of these soldiers are pierced by arrows, some are
lanced by spears, some are splashed with boiling manure, some are
hacked by harrows, and some have their heads cut off by swords,
whereby they incur death or deadly suffering. Now this too is a
danger in the case of sensual pleasure ... the cause being simply
sensual pleasures.</p>

<p><strong>3. Myriad Forms of Human Suffering:</strong> One of the main objectives so
far in this discussion is to distinguish the <em>dukkha</em> in the Four Noble
Truths from the <em>dukkha</em> in the Three Characteristics, and also to see
how these two forms of <em>dukkha</em> are related.</p>
<p>In the previous sections, various attributes or descriptions of
suffering have been introduced. Note that these descriptions need not be
held too strictly. The Buddha presented them as simple and clear
examples for establishing a basic understanding of suffering. Yet many
of these kinds of suffering vary according to time and place. (It would
be possible to make a list of problems and afflictions that are specific
say to the modern era.) Yet, in the end all of these variations on
suffering may be summarized by the Buddha’s words: ‘In brief, the five
aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.’</p>
<p>At this point let us look at some of the classifications of <em>dukkha</em>
found in the scriptures.</p>
<p>The <em>dukkha</em> most often analyzed in the scriptures is <em>dukkha</em> of the
Four Noble Truths, because it concerns human beings directly. We should
reflect upon this suffering, to be released from it through Dhamma
practice. As for the all-inclusive <em>dukkha</em> of the Three
Characteristics, it is illustrated just enough for an accurate
understanding of reality. The chief, most frequently mentioned groups of
<em>dukkha</em> in the scriptures are listed below:</p>
<p><strong>The 12 Kinds of Dukkha:</strong> This group elucidates the meaning of
<em>dukkha</em> in the Four Noble Truths:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn47">47</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Birth (<em>jāti</em>): birth is suffering because it is a basis for various
kinds of affliction:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Gabbhokkantimūlaka-dukkha</em>: the suffering of confinement in the
womb: a foetus dwells in a dark, stifling place, full of
repugnant substances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Gabbhapariharaṇamūlaka-dukkha</em>: the suffering of carrying the
womb. Whenever the mother moves, or eats hot, cold, or spicy
food, it affects the child in the womb. {85}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Gabbhavipattimūlaka-dukkha</em>: the suffering from misfortunes of
the womb, for example ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, or
Caesarean operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vijāyanamūlaka-dukkha</em>: the suffering of childbirth, including
the pounding, twisting, squeezing and severe pain while exiting
the narrow canal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bahinikkhamanamūlaka-dukkha</em>: the suffering of emergence into
the outside world. The newly born infant, whose skin is
sensitive as a wound, feels acute pain when handled and washed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attupakkamamūlaka-dukkha</em>: the suffering that results from
self-inflicted actions, for example suicide, extreme asceticism,
refusing to eat due to resentment, or other self-injurious acts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Parupakkamamūlaka-dukkha</em>: the suffering caused by others’
deeds, for example being assaulted, murdered or imprisoned.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aging (<em>jarā</em>): aging weakens the organs. The faculties, e.g. the
eyes and ears, function defectively, vitality wanes, and agility is
lost. The skin wrinkles; it is no longer fair and lustrous. Memory
becomes incoherent and faulty. A person’s control, both internal and
external, weakens, causing great physical and mental distress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Death (<em>maraṇa</em>): if one has committed bad deeds during the course
of one’s life, they appear as mental images (<em>nimitta</em>) at the time
of death. One must be separated from cherished people and things.
The constituent parts of the body cease to perform their duties,
there may be intense physical pain, and one is impotent to remedy
the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grief (<em>soka</em>), for example from the loss of a relative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lamentation (<em>parideva</em>), for example keening at the loss of a
relative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical pain (<em>dukkha</em>), for example wounds, sprains and
sickness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn48">48</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distress (<em>domanassa</em>; anguish), which causes crying, beating one’s
breast, committing suicide, etc..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frustration (<em>upāyāsa</em>; despair), for instance the torment of
unmitigated grief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Association with disagreeable people or things (<em>appiya-sampayoga</em>),
for example the need to engage with a person whom one detests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Separation from cherished people or things (<em>piya-vippayoga</em>), for
example separation from loved ones or the loss of possessions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not obtaining what one wants; disappointment (<em>icchitālābha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The five aggregates, which are the foundation for clinging
(<em>upādāna-khandhā</em>). All of the aforementioned suffering stems from
the five aggregates as objects of clinging. To sum up, one can say
that suffering <em>is</em> the five aggregates of clinging. {86}</p>

<p><strong>The Two Dukkha (B):</strong><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn50">50</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Pariyāya-dukkha</em>: indirect or implicit <em>dukkha</em>, i.e. every form of
<em>dukkha</em> mentioned above excluding painful feeling
(<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>).</p>

<p>The Mahāniddesa and the Cūḷaniddesa offer many additional categories of
<em>dukkha</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn51">51</a></sup> For matter of simplicity, they can be sorted into the
following groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suffering as birth (<em>jāti-dukkha</em>), aging (<em>jarā-dukkha</em>), illness
(<em>byādhi-dukkha</em>), death (<em>maraṇa-dukkha</em>), sorrow, lamentation,
pain, anguish and despair
(<em>soka-parideva-dukkha-domanassa-upāyāsa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The suffering of hell beings (<em>nerayika-dukkha</em>), of animals
(<em>tiracchānayonika-dukkha</em>), of ghosts (<em>pittivisayika-dukkha</em>), and
of humans (<em>mānusaka-dukkha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The suffering experienced from taking birth in a womb
(<em>gabbhokkantimūlaka-dukkha</em>), from living in a womb
(<em>gabbheṭhitimūlaka-dukkha</em>), and from exiting a womb
(<em>gabbhavuṭṭhānamūlaka-dukkha</em>); the suffering inherent in one who
is born (<em>jātassūpanibandhika-dukkha</em>); the suffering of one who is
born, due to being dependent on others
(<em>jātassaparādheyyaka-dukkha</em>); self-inflicted suffering
(<em>attūpakkama-dukkha</em>); and suffering inflicted by others
(<em>parūpakkama-dukkha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pain (<em>dukkha</em>-<em>dukkha</em>), the <em>dukkha</em> of formations
(<em>saṅkhāra</em>-<em>dukkha</em>), and <em>dukkha</em> inherent in change
(<em>vipariṇāma-dukkha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various kinds of diseases, for example eye and ear diseases;
thirty-five kinds of diseases are mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Illness resulting from eight causes, including bile, phlegm and
wind, or a combination of these causes; illness resulting from
changes in the weather and irregular exercise; afflictions due to
other people’s actions – for example being murdered or imprisoned,
and the effects of personal actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suffering owing to cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation,
urination, wind, sun, flies, mosquitoes and crawling creatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suffering resulting from the death of one’s mother, father, brother,
sister, or child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suffering due to loss of relatives, loss of possessions, loss
through sickness, loss of moral conduct, and loss of cherished views
and opinions. {87}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Mahādukkhakkhandha and the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha suttas, the Buddha
describes many examples of the <em>’<em>mass of suffering</em>’</em>
(<em>dukkha</em>-<em>khandha</em>), the plights afflicting humans because of sense
desire.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn52">52</a></sup> They are summarized as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The hardship or even loss of life due to one’s occupation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disappointment experienced when one’s labour is in vain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The suffering in trying to protect acquired wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The grief that ensues when such protection is unsuccessful and
wealth is lost, for example to thieves or fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disputes and violence between rulers, between householders,
between parents and children, between siblings, and between friends,
leading to death or serious injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The slaughter and severe agony of war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The injury and death resulting from invasion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The committal of crimes, for example burglary or adultery, followed
by arrest and conviction, and ending in torture and execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The performance of physical, verbal and mental misdeeds, leading
after death to states of deprivation, perdition, and hell.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>More references to <em>dukkha</em> are located throughout the scriptures and
commentaries. In some places the descriptions have no specific name (as
in the examples of the Mahā- and the Cūḷadukkhakkhandha suttas mentioned
above), while in others <em>dukkha</em> is identified by special terms such as
<em>saṁsāra-dukkha,</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn53">53</a></sup> <em>apāya-dukkha</em> (suffering of the lower realms),
<em>vaṭṭamūlaka-dukkha</em> (suffering through the round of rebirth), or
<em>āhārapariyeṭṭhi-dukkha,</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn54">54</a></sup> to list just a few.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn55">55</a></sup> {88}</p>
<p>It would be possible to elaborate much more on this subject of
suffering, since human beings encounter so many problems, including the
afflictions faced by all living creatures, and suffering specific to
certain time periods, regions, and circumstances, but it is not
necessary to offer a drawn-out explanation. More important is to realize
that the many scriptural descriptions exist to promote an understanding
of the true nature of suffering. With this understanding we can respond
correctly to it. We acknowledge that we must engage with suffering,
rather than resort to evasion, self-deception, or to the denial that
either suffering does not exist or that it cannot affect us. Such
deception only creates more complex problems and more severe affliction.
Our responsibility is rather that of facing and understanding suffering
(<em>pariññā-kicca</em>), to have victory over it, and to be freed from it:
this is the practice of walking the path leading to suffering’s
cessation, a cessation both temporary and permanent. {89}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#nonself" id="nonself">Nonself</a></h3>
<h4><a class="header" href="#scope" id="scope">Scope</a></h4>
<p>As explained earlier the factor of nonself (<em>anattatā</em>) has a broader
application than the factors of impermanence and <em>dukkha</em>. One sees the
difference clearly in the Buddha’s presentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā</em>: all conditioned phenomena are impermanent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā</em>: all conditioned phenomena are subject to
stress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sabbe dhammā anattā</em>: all things are nonself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This teaching indicates that conditioned phenomena (and all conditioned
phenomena) are impermanent and <em>dukkha</em>. But something exists apart from
such phenomena, which is neither impermanent nor subject to stress. All
things without exception, however, are <em>anattā</em>: they are nonself.
Nothing exists which is a self or possesses a self.</p>
<p>The definition of <em>dhamma</em> encompasses all things. As <em>dhamma</em> includes
all things it can be subdivided indefinitely. One can, however, classify
things into groups and categories. The division pertinent to this
discussion is into conditioned things (<em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>) and the
Unconditioned (<em>asaṅkhata-dhamma</em>).</p>
<p><em>Saṅkhata-dhamma</em> refers to things created by conditioning factors
(<em>paccaya</em>). These things can be simply called <em>saṅkhāra,</em> and include
all materiality and mentality, constituting the five aggregates.
<em>Asaṅkhata-dhamma</em>, the Unconditioned, is neither created nor supported
by conditioning factors; it is also called <em>visaṅkhāra</em>: the state
transcending the five aggregates, that is, Nibbāna.</p>
<p>One can describe this law of nature in more detail as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All conditioned things (the five aggregates) are impermanent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All conditioned things (the five aggregates) are <em>dukkha</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things, both conditioned things and the Unconditioned, are
nonself. {90}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="header" href="#basic-definition" id="basic-definition">Basic Definition</a></h4>
<p><em>Anattā</em> can be translated as ‘not-self’, ‘selfless’, or ‘nonself’. The
statement ‘all things are <em>anattā</em>’ means that all things exist or
proceed according to their own nature. They do not exist as or possess a
‘self’ – a substantial entity – that is able to control things at
will. As <em>anattā</em> is a negation of <em>attā</em>, to comprehend the
characteristic of nonself we must first understand the meaning of
<em>attā</em>.</p>
<p><em>Attā</em> (Sanskrit – <em>ātman</em>) refers to an eternal self or substance,
which is the purported essence or core of any particular thing, residing
permanently in an object. It is both owner and controller, the essential
recipient of experience and agent of action. It is that which lies
behind all phenomena, including all life, able to direct things in
conformity with its needs and desires.</p>
<p>Some religions elaborate by claiming that a superior ‘Self’ or ‘Spirit’
lies behind all worldly phenomena, reigning over the souls or substance
of all living beings and inanimate objects. They claim that this supreme
Spirit creates and governs all things, or that it is the source and
destination of all things and all life. In Hinduism, for example, it is
called Brahmā or Paramātman.</p>
<p>The gist of the teaching on <em>anattā</em> is the negation of this fixed
abiding self, both mundane and transcendent; it asserts that this self
is simply an idea stemming from a misapprehension by unawakened human
beings, who do not see the true nature of the world. People create a
(concept of) self and superimpose it on reality; this (concept of) self
then obstructs them from seeing the truth.</p>
<p>A clear understanding of nonself dispels the misapprehension and
dissolves the obscuring (idea of) self. The teaching of nonself bids us
to discern with wisdom that all things, all components of reality, exist
and proceed in conformity with their own nature. No hidden, abiding self
exists as owner or director; things are not subservient to an internal
or external control.</p>
<p>A basic definition of selflessness, both in regard to conditioned
phenomena and the Unconditioned, is that all things exist in compliance
with their nature, and are not subordinate to an external authority. If
a substantial, controlling self were to reside in things, phenomena
would not be able to exist and proceed as they do according to their own
nature. The very nature of phenomena reveals this characteristic of
nonself.</p>
<p>To elaborate on this definition one must examine the distinction between
conditioned phenomena and the Unconditioned. The Unconditioned, or
Nibbāna, on the one hand, is an absolute truth (<em>dhamma-dhātu</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn56">56</a></sup>
existing independent of conditioning factors. It is neither a being, nor
a consciousness, nor a self (<em>nissatta-nijjīva</em>); it cannot be possessed
or controlled; nor does it act in any sort of creative role. {91}</p>
<p>Compounded phenomena, on the other hand, are dependent on and conform to
those factors which act as catalysts or creative agents. These phenomena
are void of an inner substance that experiences the formative process or
controls the five aggregates, commanding the aggregates to follow desire
independent of the laws of cause and effect.</p>
<p>A basic definition in the scriptures for <em>anattā</em> is
<em>avasavattanaṭṭhena</em> (alternatively, <em>avasa-vattanato</em> or
<em>avasavattito</em>): ‘something is described as nonself in the sense that it
is not subject to control’. No one is able to demand or order that
things proceed according to his or her desires (things are not subject
to our desires).</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#implied-definition" id="implied-definition">Implied Definition</a></h4>
<p>Before proceeding, one needs to understand that the Buddhist teaching
refers to a self solely on a conventional level: the self is a relative
truth; it is not believed to be absolute. This is made clear by the
Buddha’s statement that a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha does not
establish a self as part of his doctrine; he does not regard the self as
real:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Seniya, the teacher who does not declare a self as real or true,
either in this world or the next, is called the Perfectly Enlightened
Buddha.</p>
<p><em>Kvu. 68; Pug. 38.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Consequently, the Buddhist teachings do not concern themselves with the
existence of self or engage in a diagnosis of self. Moreover, the Buddha
stated:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>It is impossible for a person endowed with right view (i.e. a
stream-enterer) to grasp any thing (<em>dhamma</em>) as self.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn57">57</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. III. 438.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the realization of the supreme state, no reason remains for an
arahant to contemplate a self. This is substantiated by the Buddha’s
designation of an arahant as one who has ‘abandoned the self’ or
‘discarded the self’ (<em>attañjaho</em>/<em>attañjaha</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn58">58</a></sup> an arahant has
abandoned the belief in a self, the view of existing as or possessing a
self. Some passages describe an arahant as ‘having abandoned the self,
not clinging to anything’ (<em>attaṃ pahāya anupādiyāno</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn59">59</a></sup></p>
<p>The following passage from the Tipiṭaka summarizes this matter: {92}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>All formations are impermanent, subject to stress, and nonself;
Nibbāna and designations are nonself.</p>
<p><em>Vin. VI. (Parivāra) 86; quoted earlier.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Although a self does not truly exist, attachment to self does, and most
people fervently embrace a notion of a fixed self. The Buddha rejected
the validity of such a notion, and encouraged people to abandon the
attachment to self. In Buddhism, a substantial self is of no importance;
it is not a matter requiring speculation. Buddhism focuses on the
attachment to self or on the concept of self that is the object of such
attachment. Buddhism teaches people to release the attachment. With its
release one’s responsibility is fulfilled, and a fixed stable self no
longer has relevance.</p>
<p>To summarize, once a person understands that conditioned things are
selfless, the topic of self versus nonself is over. A person who has
realized the Unconditioned no longer identifies with anything as a self.
Furthermore, any explanation for the selfless nature of the
Unconditioned, i.e. Nibbāna, becomes redundant. To elaborate on Nibbāna
as <em>anattā</em> is unnecessary for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The only things that people attach to and are able to attach to as
self are conditioned phenomena or the five aggregates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All that unawakened people recognize, know, and think about lies
within the confines of the five aggregates. Even when speaking of
Nibbāna, the Nibbāna they refer to is not the real Nibbāna, but part
of the five aggregates. Awakened beings know Nibbāna for themselves
and have abandoned any belief in self, so they need not refer to
this subject of self. If they do speak, they simply state that
arahants have completely ‘abandoned the (belief in) self’
(<em>attañjaha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The duty of a teacher in this context is only to prompt people to
know and then abandon their misunderstanding which leads them to
grasp conditioned things as self.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once people are fully aware, abandoning erroneous views and ceasing
to grasp the five aggregates as self, they do not search for
anything else to cling to as a self, because they have clearly
realized Nibbāna, which transcends the five aggregates along with
all belief in self. Those who have realized Nibbāna discern by
themselves the selfless quality of the Unconditioned; there is no
further need to discuss this matter. Transcending the state of an
ordinary person (from the level of stream-entry upwards) results in
the end of clinging to and doubting about a self; the obligation to
discuss the selfless nature of the Unconditioned vanishes
automatically. In other words, for awakened beings, no reference to
a self arises to cling to, to doubt over, or to debate about.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard scriptural explanations of <em>anattā</em> therefore refer to
conditioned phenomena (i.e. the five aggregates), which are of everyday
relevance to people and comprise all things that ordinary unawakened
people are able to conceive of from their experience. {93}</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#scriptural-explanation" id="scriptural-explanation">Scriptural Explanation</a></h4>
<p>As stated above, the common scriptural explanations of <em>anattā</em> focus on
conditioned things because these teachings are presented to ordinary,
unawakened people and touch upon everyday issues.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those things that ordinary unawakened people are able to
conceive of as self are limited to conditioned things (<em>saṅkhāra</em>), or
limited to the five aggregates. Therefore, the explanations of nonself
focus exclusively on the five aggregates. This corresponds with the
Buddha’s words:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, whichever ascetics and brahmans who regard self in various ways
all regard the five aggregates subject to clinging, or a certain one
among them. What five?</p>
<p>Monks, the uninstructed, ordinary person ... regards form as self, or
self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. He
regards feeling as self ... perception as self ... volitional
formations as self ... consciousness as self ... or self as in
consciousness. This way of regarding things thus becomes his fixed
belief that ‘I exist’.</p>
<p><em>S. III. 46.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In other words, (belief in) a self only exists where the five aggregates
exist, and exists because of clinging to these aggregates, as explained
by the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, when what exists, by relying on what, by adhering to what, does
such a view as this arise: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my
self’?....</p>
<p>When there is form, monks, by relying on form, by adhering to form,
such a view as this arises: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my
self.’ When there is feeling ... perception ... volitional formations
... consciousness, by relying on consciousness, by adhering to
consciousness, such a view as this arises: ‘This is mine, I am this,
this is my self.’</p>
<p><em>S. III. 203-204.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>At this point let us examine some of the numerous scriptural
explanations of nonself. The Paṭisambhidāmagga defines something as
<em>anattā</em> in the sense that it is insubstantial (<em>asārakaṭṭhena</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn60">60</a></sup>
Insubstantial means to be without essence, to be without a core, and to
possess nothing that is truly stable or enduring.</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Insubstantial means the absence of an essential, nuclear self
(<em>atta-sāra</em>), which is thought of as a self (<em>attā</em>), an abider
(<em>nivāsī</em>), an agent (<em>kāraka</em>), an experiencer (<em>vedaka</em>), or an
autonomous master (<em>sayaṁvasī</em>). {94} For whatever is impermanent is
dukkha; it is unable to prevent its transience or its oppression from
rising and falling. How then can it exist as a doer, and so on? Hence,
the Buddha said: ‘Monks, if this physical form, for example, were
self, surely it would not be subject to affliction.’</p>
<p><em>Vism. 610.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Note that this definition of non-essence or selflessness includes the
absence of a creative role or a lack of intrinsic control. If one were
to possess a stable enduring self as a core, then one could resist
change; one would not be subject to change. Similarly, if one were
master over things, one could manipulate possessions according to
desire. Reality, however, is not this way. A distinctive feature of the
absence of an abiding self is the inability to dominate conditions, and
their opposition to desire.</p>
<p>Note that Buddha-Dhamma considers even Brahma, God, or whichever supreme
creator deity, to exist within the conditioned world, to be confined to
the five aggregates, and thus wielding restricted power.</p>
<p>In this sense, the commentaries prefer to define <em>anattā</em> as ‘the
inability to control’ or ‘not subject to control’ (<em>avasavattanaṭṭhena</em>
or <em>avasavattanato</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn61">61</a></sup> Likewise, they explain that no one can force
formations into subservience, in defiance of cause and effect, by
demanding that arisen phenomena not exist, that existent phenomena not
age, and that aging phenomena not perish.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn62">62</a></sup> They quote the Buddha’s
words:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A person cannot in regard to physical form obtain [as wished for]:
‘May form be this way, may form not be that way.’ (Same with the other
aggregates.)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn63">63</a></sup></p>
<p><em>VbhA. 49; VinṬ.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When one thoroughly examines the nature of all things, one finds that no
fixed and permanent self exists, as is implied by giving things
particular names. There is merely a natural process (<em>dhamma-pavatti</em>)
– a process of conditionality – or a process of materiality and
mentality (<em>khandha-pavatti</em>), which originates from the confluence of
manifold constituents. All of these constituents arise and cease in a
continual, intercausal relationship, both within a single isolated
dynamic, and within all creation. This being so, we should take note of
four significant points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no true, enduring self within any phenomenon, existing as
an essence or core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All conditioned things arise from the convergence of components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These components continually arise and disintegrate, and are
co-dependent, constituting a specific dynamic of nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one separates a specific dynamic into subordinate dynamics, one
sees that these too are co-dependent. {95}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The manifestation and transformation of a dynamic is determined by the
relationship of its components. The dynamic proceeds without the
intervention by a ‘self’. No separate self exists, neither an internal
enduring self that resists cause and effect and is able to direct the
activity according to its wishes, nor an independent external agent.</p>
<p>Human beings confer names to many of these assemblies and formations,
for example ‘person’, ‘horse’, ‘cat’, ‘ant’, ‘car’, ‘shop’, ‘house’,
‘clock’, ‘pen’, ‘Mr. Jones’, and ‘Ms. Smith’. These names, however, are
simply conventional labels, established for convenience of
communication. The entities do not really exist: they do not have a real
self, a separate identity distinct from their collective components.
Upon analysis of these entities what remains is each unit or part with
its own specific name. It is not possible to find a self within such
entities, no matter how deeply one searches.</p>
<p>By giving names to things one creates a provisional self that is
superimposed on the true condition. It is superimposed randomly, without
any direct relationship to, control over, or affect on that particular
dynamic, except when one clings to the conventional designation
(clinging is then one component of the process). If names are just
conventional labels, arbitrarily superimposed, then it is self-evident
that they are powerless.</p>
<p>When elements convene and manifest as particular forms, we assign agreed
upon names to these forms. As long as the components are conjoined, they
sustain the particular shape corresponding to a conventional identity.
When the components split up, however, or the surrounding conditions are
unsupportive, the form disappears. For example, when temperature rises
above a certain level, ice melts; the entity called ‘ice’ vanishes, with
water remaining. With a further increase in temperature, water
evaporates, turning to steam; that entity of ‘water’ ceases to be.
Likewise, when paper is burned, only ashes remain; the entity called
‘paper’ is no longer found.</p>
<p>The dynamics of nature occur in line with cause and effect; they do not
obey desire, and they are not influenced by these randomly established
identities. They do not obey desire because, speaking accurately, desire
does not serve an autonomous self; desire is one component within a
causal process, and it is not the agent that accomplishes a deed. Desire
is only able to produce results when it acts as an impetus, affecting
subsequent conditions like effort or action, in conformity with cause
and effect.</p>
<p>A distinct, independent self cannot exist; were it to exist, it would
not be subject to causality – it would be fixed. It would impede the
causal flow, rendering all other elements dispensable. Any fluent
dynamic would be nullified. Such a self could interfere with and modify
conditions, causing a deviation from causality. In truth, however, all
conditioned things proceed according to cause and effect. A separate
self does not truly exist, either within a dynamic or externally. The
only self that exists is the conventional self, which needs to be
understood or else it ends up deceiving and oppressing people. {96}</p>
<p>The basic meaning of <em>anattatā</em> – that all things arise as a
composition of interrelated parts following cause and effect, are void
of an enduring self, and are without a fixed creative agent – is
confirmed by many references in the scriptures, for example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Just as when a space is enclosed by timber, twine, clay and thatch, it
comes to be called a ‘house’, so too, when a space is enclosed by
bones and sinews, flesh and skin, it comes to be called a ‘body’
(<em>rūpa</em>).</p>

<p>Māra asked Vajirā Bhikkhunī:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Who created this being (person)? Where is the creator of beings? Where
does a being originate? Where does a being cease?</p>
<p>[Vajirā answered:]</p>
<p>Māra, do you believe in a being? Do you hold [such] a view? This is
purely a mass of formations; here, no being can be found. Just as with
the combination of various parts, the term ‘wagon’ ensues, so too,
with the five aggregates the conventional term ‘being’ ensues. Indeed,
there is only dukkha that arises, abides, and passes away. Nothing but
dukkha comes to be, nothing but dukkha ceases.</p>

<p>Māra asked the same question to Selā Bhikkhunī, who answered:</p>
<div class="sutta">

seeds when sown on a field will sprout, owing to both the nutrients in

elements, and six senses arise dependent upon causes, and cease with
the dissolution of those causes.</p>

<p>A collection of soldiers, vehicles and weapons is called an army. We
call a group of buildings, houses, people and enterprises a city. A hand
with fingers placed in a certain position is called a fist. Uncurl the
fist and only a hand with fingers remains. Similarly, when one separates
a hand into ancillary parts, then it too no longer exists. One can
continue to subdivide, but one will be unable to find any static units
or elements. The suttas contain only teachings of materiality &amp;
mentality (<em>nāma-rūpa</em>); there is no mention of a fixed ‘being’ or
‘person’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn64">64</a></sup> {97}</p>
<p>There are four principal definitions of <em>anattā</em> compiled by the
commentators. Although these definitions are normally used in reference
to conditioned phenomena (<em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>), they also apply to the
Unconditioned (<em>asaṅkhata-dhamma</em>). Something is considered nonself for
the following reasons:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn65">65</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Suññato</em>: because it exists in a state of emptiness; it exists
according to its own nature. It is without a self as essence or core
(<em>atta-sāra</em>). It is void of a real identity as ‘person’, ‘I’,
‘him’, or ‘her’. There is no occupant, agent, or experiencer apart
from the causal process, or apart from provisional designations.
Things exist independently from their assigned or cherished
identities, for example ‘man’, ‘woman’, ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘object A’ or
‘object B’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Assāmikato</em>: because it is ownerless; it does not belong to a
person or to a self. No separate self exists that possesses
phenomena. Phenomena exist according to their inherent conditioned
or unconditioned nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Avasa-vattanato</em>: because it is not subject to control; it does not
depend on anyone. It is not under anyone’s power, and it is not
dictated by a ‘self’. A related term used is <em>anissarato</em>,
translated as ‘not subject to a ruler’ or ‘not subject to the
authority by a controlling self’. We have no absolute power over
things; we must concur with causes. In some places one finds the
term <em>akāmakāriyato</em>, translated as ‘unable to do as one pleases’.
Things do not obey desires; the mind of desire cannot dictate
things. If one wants things to be a certain way, then one must
conform to or bring about the proper causes and conditions. Things
depend on causes and conditions, not on someone’s power or desire.
For example, it is impossible to order something that has arisen to
disappear, or to not change, or to not deteriorate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Atta-paṭikkhepato</em>: because it is inconsistent with or opposes a
self. Were a substantial, fixed self to exist, it would conflict
with phenomena, causing them to deviate from their own inherent
nature. Ordinary people can recognize this from examining
conditioned phenomena. The causal process of interrelated components
is inherently incompatible with a separate, autonomous self, which
would dictate or interfere with that process. Such an isolated self
cannot exist. If it were to exist, a causal dynamic could not occur;
the course of events would necessarily follow the dictates of self.
{98} Furthermore, the law of causality is intrinsically complete; it
does not require a controlling agent to intervene.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two additional definitions of <em>anattā</em>, which, although
included within the four points mentioned above, are particularly
important and should thus be distinguished. They refer exclusively to
conditioned phenomena, highlighting their dynamic nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Suddha-saṅkhāra-puñjato</em> or <em>suddha-dhamma-puñjato</em>: Things exist
purely as a mass of formations, or as a mass of phenomena
(<em>dhamma</em>), that is, materiality (<em>rūpa-dhamma</em>) and/or mentality
(<em>nāma-dhamma</em>). Another term used is <em>aṅgasambhārato</em>, meaning that
things exist as a composition of subsidiary parts. They arise from
the gathering together of such parts. They are not absolute enduring
‘units’ or ‘entities’. There is no real ‘being’, ‘person’ or ‘self’
over and above these components. (This definition is already
stressed in point 1 above.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yathāpaccaya-pavattito</em>: Things exist following causes and
conditions. They exist as a collection of interrelated and
co-dependent parts. Things do not follow a person’s desires, and no
self exists, either as an internal essence or as an external agent,
which resists or directs the process. (All four of the above points
include this definition, especially points 3 and 4.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, all things exist according to their own nature. In the case
of conditioned phenomena (<em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>), they proceed according to
specific causes and conditions. If the determinant causes exist, a
phenomenon originates in conformity with these causes. If these causes
cease, the phenomenon ceases (to exist in that way). Things do not obey
supplication or desire. They are not ‘entities’ or ‘things’ as commonly
identified, and they do not belong to anyone. As explained earlier,
these definitions of <em>anattā</em> presented here focus on conditioned
phenomena, which ordinary people engage with and can learn from.</p>
<p>One of the major misunderstandings for people is the belief that a
‘thinker’ exists apart from thinking, a ‘planner’ exists apart from
volition, a ‘feeler’ exists apart from feelings, or an ‘actor’ exists
apart from actions.</p>
<p>This misunderstanding has trapped many of the great philosophers, who
were therefore unable to realize the truth and be free from the
enshrouding influence of self-view. René Descartes, the famous French
philosopher, is an example, who after much consideration, postulated, ‘I
think, therefore I am.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>The belief in a distinct self or soul is common to unenlightened beings
everywhere. This belief seems true and logical through ordinary
awareness, but once one thoroughly investigates the premise of self,
contradictions appear. {99}</p>
<p>People often posed questions about the self to the Buddha, for example:
‘<em>Who makes contact (who cognizes)? Who feels? Who craves? Who clings?</em>’
The Buddha answered that these are unsuitable questions, which stem from
a false assumption; they are not consistent with reality. Appropriate
questions are: ‘<em>What is the condition giving rise to contact? What is
the condition giving rise to feeling? What are the conditions giving
rise to craving and clinging?</em>’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn67">67</a></sup></p>
<p>Just as thought, intention, desire, and feeling are components of a
physical and mental process, so too the experience of a ‘thinker’ or a
‘designer’ is a component of this process. All of these components exist
in an intercausal relationship. There is simply thought and an
experience of a ‘thinker’ (i.e. a false belief in a thinker – a thinker
does not exist) arising within a single dynamic.</p>
<p>The experience of a thinker is actually a thought pattern; it is one
instant in the thought process. The erroneous belief in a thinker arises
due to a person’s inability to distinguish the related parts, and to
distinguish each momentary event within the continuum.</p>
<p>At the time of thought, there is no experience of a ‘thinker’; and at
the instant of experiencing a ‘thinker’ there is no (other) thought.
While thinking of a certain subject, one does not reflect upon a
‘thinker’; and while reflecting upon a ‘thinker’, one does not think
about that previous subject of consideration. Thinking of a subject and
experiencing a ‘thinker’ (thinking of a ‘thinker’) are actually
different moments of thought, which exist in the same dynamic. The
‘thinker’ is just a mental fabrication, which then becomes an object for
further thought during another instant of time.</p>
<p>The fallacy mentioned above results from a lack of thorough attention
(<em>ayoniso-manasikāra</em>) and is classified as one of the six views
mentioned in the Buddha’s teaching:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>When that unenlightened being attends unwisely in this way, one of the
six views arises in him:</p>
<p>There arises in him the [fixed] view, as true and established, that</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>‘I have a self’ ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘I do not have a self’ ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘I know the self by way of the self’ ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘I know nonself by way of the self’ ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘I know the self by way of nonself’;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or else he has some such view as this: ‘It is this self of mine
that dictates, feels, and experiences here and there the fruit of
good and bad actions.’</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>M. I. 8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>It was mentioned earlier how a name assigned to a particular entity is a
contrived and arbitrarily superimposed self, which, unless clung to, has
no relationship to or effect on the causal dynamic. Although such a self
does not truly exist, clinging to that idea of self creates problems.
This is because the clinging becomes a part of the dynamic, determining
other components, and affecting the dynamic as a whole.</p>
<p>Clinging to a sense of self is an unwholesome factor since it stems from
ignorance; it contaminates other elements of the process, interfering
adversely with the causal stream. {100} One effect of clinging is that
it produces a conflict within the dynamic, resulting in a feeling of
oppression or suffering. People who hold tightly to the conventional
self as real are afflicted by this grasping.</p>
<p>Those who fully comprehend conventional labels, on the other hand, do
not cling to the idea of a self, seeing merely a causal continuum. These
people use whichever term is commonly assigned to a particular object,
but they can enhance the dynamic as they please, by acting in harmony
with its determining factors. They do not allow craving and clinging to
oppress them, thus avoiding the consequent suffering. Such people know
how to benefit from conventional labels without suffering the harm of
attaching to them.</p>
<p>Another detrimental effect of clinging to a self is the production of
unwholesome mind states, known as ‘defilements’ (<em>kilesa</em>). In
particular, these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Taṇhā</em>: craving; selfishness; the lust for gratification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Māna</em>: conceit; self-judgement; the yearning for personal power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhi</em>: the firm grasping to personal opinions; the stubborn,
unyielding belief that one’s views represent the truth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These three defilements intensify both internal and external discord.
People who do not see through conventional labels cling to randomly
established identities as the truth and allow these defilements to
dictate their behaviour, compounding misery for themselves and others.
Those who penetrate the relative truth of conventional labels, however,
do not cling to them, and are freed from the influence of these
defilements. They are not deceived by such thoughts as ‘this belongs to
me’, ‘I am this way’, or ‘this is who I am’. They conduct their life
with wisdom. A clear understanding of conventional labels, and action in
harmony with causes and conditions, is the basis from which true safety
and freedom from suffering extends.</p>
<p>Another error that tends to entangle people is vacillation from one
extreme opinion to another. Some people strictly believe in the self as
real and permanent; they think that the self makes up the essence of a
human being, and that it is not just a conventional entity. Each person,
they say, has a real, stable, eternal self; even when a person dies the
soul/self/spirit (<em>ātman</em>/<em>attā</em>) continues unchanged: the self does not
disappear or disintegrate. Some believe that this soul reincarnates,
while others believe that it awaits judgement from the highest God for
eternal salvation or damnation. Such views fall under the category of
eternalism (<em>sassata-diṭṭhi</em> or <em>sassata-vāda</em>): the belief that the
self or soul is real and everlasting.</p>
<p>Another group of people believe that such a self exists, that a person
exists as a definite identity, but that this self is temporary: it
disintegrates. At death, they claim, the self breaks apart and ceases.
This view is called annihilationism (<em>uccheda-diṭṭhi</em> or
<em>uccheda-vāda</em>): the belief that the self or soul is impermanent; it
exists temporarily and then breaks up and vanishes.</p>
<p>Scholars of Buddhist studies may also embrace one of these views if they
lack clear understanding. Those who study the law of kamma in connection
to the round of rebirth (<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>) may hold an eternalist view,
regarding the self as permanent. Those who misapprehend the teachings of
<em>anattā</em>, on the other hand, may hold an annihilationist view, believing
that nothing exists after death. {101}</p>
<p>The common point of misunderstanding for proponents of these two
extremes is the belief that a being or person exists as a real, fixed
entity. One party believes that this entity is constant and eternal,
while the other believes that this entity breaks up and vanishes at
death.</p>
<p>Besides these two, there is another group with an even more extreme
view, believing that the absence of self means that nothing at all
exists. If no one exists, then no one experiences results. Therefore,
actions have no consequences, actions are insignificant, and there is no
accountability regarding actions. Speaking simply, there is no kamma.</p>
<p>One can divide this last-named kind of belief into three categories. One
faction believes that actions are meaningless, or that actions bear no
fruit. This is called the doctrine of the inefficacy of action
(<em>akiriya-diṭṭhi</em> or <em>akiriya-vāda</em>). Another faction believes that
things occur haphazardly, by chance, without any causes. This is called
the doctrine of non-causality or accidentalism (<em>ahetuka-diṭṭhi</em> or
<em>ahetuka-vāda</em>). The third faction believes that absolutely nothing
exists: nothing exists with any value or meaning. This is called
nihilism (<em>natthika-diṭṭhi</em> or <em>natthika-vāda</em>).</p>
<p>Since all things exist as a causal continuum, originating from the
merging of components, there is no self which either endures or
disintegrates. In this very instant no ‘person’ or ‘self’ exists; where
can one find an enduring or dissolving self? This teaching negates both
eternalism and annihilationism.</p>
<p>Since the dynamics of nature consist of interrelated, causally dependent
components, how can one claim that nothing exists, or that things occur
haphazardly and by chance? The teaching negates the doctrines of
nihilism and non-causality.</p>
<p>As dynamics change according to inherent causal factors, each agent
within a dynamic produces an effect; none is void of effect. Moreover,
results ensue without a need for a ‘receiver’ of such results; results
are intrinsic to the dynamic. Notionally, one can say that the dynamic
itself is the recipient. These results are more certain than if a stable
self were to exist as the receiver, since the self could reject
unwelcome results. As the law of causality exists, how can one claim
that actions are meaningless or have no results? The teaching negates
the doctrine of the inefficacy of action.</p>
<p>The following passages from the Visuddhimagga corroborate the
explanations presented above:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Truly, in this world there is only mentality and matter. Here there is
no being or person to be found. This mentality and matter is empty. It
is fashioned like an instrument (by conditioning factors) – just a
mass of instability (<em>dukkha</em>) like grass and sticks. {102}</p>
<p><em>Vism. 595.</em></p>
<p>Suffering exists, but no sufferer can be found. Actions exist, but no
agent. Nibbāna exists, but no one who is quenched. The Path exists,
but no wayfarer.</p>
<p><em>Vism. 513.</em></p>
<p>There is no doer of a deed, or one who reaps the deed’s results;
phenomena alone flow on. This is right view. While kamma and fruition
(<em>vipāka</em>) thus causally maintain their round, as seed and tree
succeed in turn, no first beginning can be known. Nor in the future
round of births (<em>saṁsāra</em>) can an absence of this cycle of kamma and
fruition be discerned. Adherents of other sects, not knowing this,
have failed to gain self-mastery (<em>asayaṁvasī</em> – they are dependent
on others because of wrong view). They assume a being (<em>satta-saññā</em>),
viewing it as eternal or annihilated. They adopt the sixty-two kinds
of views, each contradicting the other. The stream of craving bears
them on, the mesh of views entangles them. And as the stream thus
bears them on, they are not freed from suffering. A disciple of the
Buddha, with direct knowledge of this fact, penetrates this deep and
subtle void conditionality.</p>
<p>There is no kamma in fruition, nor does fruition exist in kamma.
Though they are empty of one another, no fruit exists without the act.
Similarly, fire does not exist inside sunlight, a [magnifying]
glass, or in cow dung [used for fuel], nor yet outside them, but is
kindled by their conjunction. So neither can the fruit be found within
a deed, nor without; nor does a deed still persist [in the fruit it
has produced]. Kamma of its fruit is void; no fruit exists yet in an
act. And still the fruit is born of kamma, dependent on kamma. For
here there is no Creator God, no Creator of the round of births;
phenomena alone flow on, dependent on the marriage of conditions.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn68">68</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Vism. 602-3</em></p>
<p>Natural phenomena arise wholly from causes, are subject to stress,
impermanent, unstable and inconstant. All things arise from other
things in mutual dependence. There is no personal or external self
within this continuum.</p>
<p>Phenomena give rise to other phenomena, by the union of causes and
conditions. The Buddha taught the Dhamma for the cessation of causes.
With the cessation of causes, the cycle (<em>vaṭṭa</em>) is broken, and
revolves no more. The sublime life (<em>brahmacariya</em>) exists to end all
suffering in this way. When no being can be found, there is neither
annihilation nor eternity. {103}</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>To summarize, the teaching of <em>anattā</em> confirms the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It negates both the doctrines of eternalism and annihilationism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It negates the belief in a supreme God who created the world and
governs the destiny of human beings, i.e. theistic determinism
(<em>issaranimmita-vāda</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is consistent with the teaching of kamma as defined by
Buddha-Dhamma, at the same time negating the following doctrines:
the claim that actions have no results (doctrine of the inefficacy
of action); the doctrine of past-action determinism
(<em>pubbekatavāda</em>), for example of the Nigaṇṭhā Order (Jainism); the
doctrine of kamma involving a soul or a caste system (for example of
Hinduism); the claim that things occur by chance, without causes
(accidentalism); and the doctrine of nihilism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It reveals the supreme state, the final goal (<em>parama-dhamma</em>) of
Buddhism, which differs from the goal of religions that profess a
soul (<em>attavāda</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h3>
<p>The three characteristics of <em>anicca</em>, <em>dukkha</em> and <em>anattā</em> are linked;
they are three facets of the same truth, as is seen in the Buddha’s
frequent teaching: <em>Whatever is impermanent is dukkha; whatever is
dukkha is nonself</em> (<em>yad’aniccaṃ taṃ dukkhaṃ, yaṃ dukkhaṃ tad’anattā</em>).
This passage is often followed by the statement: <em>Whatever is nonself
should be seen with correct wisdom, as it truly is thus: ‘This is not
mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn69">69</a></sup> The relationship is
also evident in the frequent exchange of questions and answers:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>‘Is material form, etc., permanent or impermanent?’</p>
<p>‘Impermanent.’</p>
<p>‘Is what is impermanent oppressive or easeful?’</p>
<p>‘Oppressive.’</p>
<p>‘Of that which is impermanent, oppressive and of the nature to change,
is it proper to consider thus: “This is mine, I am this, this is my
self?” ‘</p>
<p><em>E.g.: S. III. 68; quoted earlier.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A brief explanation of the relationship between the three
characteristics, and of the fact that they are three aspects of the same
truth, can be formulated thus: all things originate by the union of
component parts. Each of these parts arises, is sustained, and
disintegrates, acting in turn as a condition for the other parts, in
perpetual transformation. One can refer to this composite as a ‘causal
continuum’, which has the following characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The arising and disintegration of components; the instability of the
components or of the entire process: <em>aniccatā</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pressure on the components or on the entire dynamic by rise and
decline, their being subject to alteration, and their inability to
remain in an original state: <em>dukkhatā</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The absence of a fixed ‘core’ that governs the collection of
components, and the requirement for the components to accord with
causes and conditions; the characteristic of nonself: <em>anattatā</em>.
{104}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By observing these three characteristics simultaneously, any object
conventionally referred to as a distinct entity is seen as a composite
of myriad clustering constituents. These constituents are unstable,
continually rising and ceasing. They split up and disperse subject to
reciprocal stress and friction, resulting in transformation. They depend
upon the relationship of causes and conditions, which control and give
form to the particular continuum. None of the components exists as a
self; they proceed in line with causality, not in compliance with
desire.</p>
<p>Although that which is impermanent is <em>dukkha</em>, and that which is
<em>dukkha</em> is non-self, the converse is not always true, that whatever is
nonself must be impermanent and <em>dukkha</em>. All conditioned phenomena
(<em>saṅkhāra</em>) are impermanent, subject to stress, and selfless, yet all
things (<em>dhamma</em>), both conditioned things and the Unconditioned
(<em>visaṅkhāra</em>), although nonself, need not invariably be impermanent and
<em>dukkha</em>. Something exists which is permanent and free of <em>dukkha</em>. The
Unconditioned (Nibbāna), although selfless, is beyond both impermanence
and <em>dukkha</em>.</p>
<p>In this sense, the definitions of the three characteristics as facets of
one truth apply to conditioned phenomena, following the explanation of
nonself mentioned earlier. Similarly, the selfless quality of the
Unconditioned should be understood in conformity with the implied
definition described above.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#concealers-of-the-three-characteristics" id="concealers-of-the-three-characteristics">Concealers of the Three Characteristics</a></h2>
<p>Although impermanence, <em>dukkha</em> and selflessness are common
characteristics to all things and reveal themselves constantly, people
generally do not notice them. They are obscured. If one does not pay
attention and investigate correctly, one does not recognize the
obscuring factors. These factors include:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn70">70</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continuity (<em>santati</em>): conceals impermanence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Movement (<em>iriyāpatha</em>): conceals <em>dukkha</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solidity (<em>ghana</em>): conceals nonself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By failing to pay close attention to arising and ceasing, to birth and
decay, one allows continuity (<em>santati</em>) to obscure the characteristic
of impermanence. All things that we experience perpetually rise and
pass, but such rising and ceasing occurs in a continuous and rapid way.
This rapid succession deceives people into viewing things as stable and
unchanging. For instance, the image of oneself or of a friend appears
the same as it did shortly before, but as time passes one realizes that
change has occurred. In truth, however, transformation happens
incessantly, without any visible gap.</p>
<p>An example of this deception is when one perceives a spinning propeller
as a single motionless disk. When the speed of rotation slows one sees a
propeller with several moving blades. Similarly, when a person quickly
waves a torch in a circular motion it appears as a circle of light.
Another example is a light bulb, which is seen as a still, bright
sphere, but in reality the light results from a rapidly fluctuating
electric current. When one applies the proper means, paying careful
attention to the rising and ceasing of things, then impermanence –
<em>aniccatā</em> – becomes clear.</p>
<p>Likewise, with a lack of attention to perpetual pressure, movement
(<em>iriyāpatha</em>) obscures the characteristic of <em>dukkha</em>. People normally
require a span of time to notice instability, an object’s inability to
maintain or be sustained in an original shape due to stress and friction
within its component parts. If in the meantime the object is moved or
modified, or the observer is separated from it, the pressure and tension
is not obvious. Our experience of things usually occurs in the context
of such movement, and so <em>dukkha</em> is not recognized. {72}</p>
<p>Take for example the human body. One need not wait until the body
perishes; even in daily life stress exists within the body, preventing a
person from remaining still in one particular position. If one must
remain in a single posture for long, whether standing, sitting, walking,
or lying, the physical strain steadily increases to the point of pain
and exhaustion, until it is unbearable. One must then move, or change
posture.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn71">71</a></sup></p>
<p>Once the pressure (a consequence of the mark of <em>dukkha</em>) in the body
ceases, the feeling of pain (<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>) also ceases. (When a
feeling of pain vanishes, there usually arises a feeling of ease in its
place, which we call ‘pleasure’. But this is simply a feeling. In
reality there is just an attenuation and absence of <em>dukkha</em> –
pressure.) Remaining for long in a single posture hurts and one hastens
to shift position. Normally, people continually move to avoid a feeling
of discomfort. By evading discomfort, the <em>dukkha</em>, a truth inherent to
all conditions, is consequently overlooked.</p>
<p>Similarly, with a failure to separate an object into various elements,
the characteristic of nonself is obscured by solidity (<em>ghana</em>):
something existing as a lump, a mass, or an amalgamated unit. All
conditioned things are created by a merging of component elements. Once
the elements are separated, that integrated unit called by a specific
name no longer exists. Generally, human beings do not discern this
truth, it being obscured by the perception of solidity (<em>ghana-saññā</em>):
the recognition or denotation of something as a consolidated entity.</p>
<p>This is consistent with the Thai folk saying: ‘One sees the coat, but
not the cloth; one sees the doll, but not the plastic.’ People may be
deceived by the image of a coat, failing to notice the fabric with which
it has been tailored. In truth, there is no coat; there are only
numerous threads woven into a pattern. If the threads are unravelled the
cloth no longer exists. Likewise, a child who only sees a doll is
deluded by its image; the plastic, which is the real substance of the
doll, is not recognized. If one discerns the truth then there is only
plastic; no doll can be found. Even the plastic originates from the
successive formation of component elements. The perception of solidity
obscures the characteristic of nonself in the manner shown by these
simple examples. If one separates and analyzes the components, the
nature of nonself becomes clear. One sees things as <em>anattā</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#nonself-and-no-self" id="nonself-and-no-self">Nonself and No-Self</a></h2>
<p>Many statements by the Buddha in the Sutta-Nipāta describe arahants –
those who have realized the goal of the holy life – as being without
<em>attā</em> and <em>nirattā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn72">72</a></sup> Arahants have neither a ‘self’ nor an
‘absence of self’.</p>
<p>The Mahāniddesa defines the word <em>attā</em> as ‘a belief in self’
(<em>attadiṭṭhi</em>) or ‘a belief in an enduring eternal self’ (i.e. an
eternalist view). It defines <em>nirattā</em> as an adherence to an
annihilationist view. Another definition of <em>attā</em> is ‘something
grasped’, and another definition for <em>nirattā</em> is ‘something to be
relinquished’.</p>
<p>Therefore an arahant does not believe in a self or in an absence of self
(an annihilation of self). An arahant neither clings to anything nor
needs to get rid of anything.</p>
<p>The Mahāniddesa explains further that whoever clings must have something
to relinquish, and whoever has something to relinquish must be clinging.
An arahant has transcended both clinging and relinquishing.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn73">73</a></sup></p>
<p>These explanations by the Buddha and the commentators elucidate the
meaning of <em>anattā</em>. {105}</p>
<p>Generally, people firmly believe in a self. At a coarse level they view
the body as the self, but upon deeper inspection, perceiving that the
body cannot be the self since physical change is so obvious, they
identify with the mind, or mental qualities, for example feelings,
memory, intelligence, and awareness. Indeed, they cling to one of the
five aggregates as self, or to a unity of body and mind, that is, to all
the five aggregates. Some people are more subtle, reckoning that the
body and mind cannot be the self, but that a distinct self – a real,
substantial, governing self or soul – abides within or beyond the body
and mind.</p>
<p>Some philosophers and religious leaders include a concept of self in
their pursuit of the ultimate reality. Some profess to have attained or
realized this truth – the Supreme Being – called by various names,
e.g. Paramātman, Brahmā, or God. Many of these philosophers and
religious leaders are highly intelligent and skilled, referred to in the
scriptures as ‘excellent ascetics and brahmans’ or ‘divine
philosophers’, and the conditions they describe are extremely profound.
But as long as these conditions still possess a fixed identity, or still
pertain to a self, they are not yet the supreme, ultimate Truth, as they
are still tainted by attachment.</p>
<p>Ultimate Truth does exist; Buddha-Dhamma is not a nihilistic doctrine.
One cannot realize this truth, however, with knowledge obscured and
distorted by false perceptions, and with a mind confined by grasping to
them. The reason that many philosophers and religious seekers are unable
to realize Ultimate Truth, although they clearly know that the self of
the body-mind (five aggregates) formerly adhered to is not real, is
because they still maintain two kinds of self-deception. These two
deceptions, characteristic of unawakened beings, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Self-identification</em>: The cherishing of a residual self-image
maintained since the body is clung to as self. However refined this
image becomes, it remains essentially the same or of the same
lineage, and is a result of misunderstanding. When such philosophers
and seekers encounter and identify with an aspect of reality, they
fix this image or concept on that condition, distorting the truth.
Whatever is known by them is therefore not the pure, unadulterated
Truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Clinging</em> (<em>upādāna</em>): Ever since believing in a rudimentary idea
of self, these people harbour a tendency towards attachment. Besides
sustaining a misguided self-view, they relate to phenomena with
attachment, which prevents them from realizing the true nature of
things. {106}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In brief, these religious seekers and philosophers are not yet
liberated. They are neither liberated from misconceptions nor from
clinging. These two deceptions are in fact inseparable: combining them,
one can say that these individuals mistakenly take an idea of self,
lingering from an original attachment, and overlay it onto reality or
nature. As a consequence they remain bound.</p>
<p>Liberation is possible only when one stops investing things with a fixed
identity; phenomena then cease to exist as substantial entities, and one
realizes the Ultimate Truth. Buddha-Dhamma teaches that the self is a
supposition, a conventional reality. Ultimate Truth is diametrically
opposed to conventional truth. The self applies to conventions; when one
transcends conventions, one attains the Ultimate Truth, which is free
from self. Stated simply, the Truth is not self; if there is still a
self, it is not the Truth. Freed from conventions, the self ceases; by
letting go, the self vanishes.</p>
<p>The prime factors for delusion are attachment and fixed notions of self.
As the self does not truly exist except on a conventional level, it is
simply a belief. The self is just an idea; it is not a true unchanging
entity. <em>Attā</em> in the above quotation from the Sutta-Nipāta can
therefore be defined in two ways, firstly as ‘self’ or ‘belief in self’,
and secondly as ‘something grasped’.</p>
<p>In addition, the passage mentions the pair of <em>attā</em> and <em>nirattā</em>, and
explains that an arahant has neither <em>attā</em> nor <em>nirattā</em>. <em>Nirattā</em> can
also be defined in two ways, firstly as ‘(clinging to) no-self’, i.e. an
annihilationist view, and secondly as ‘something to be relinquished’.
When one abandons the misapprehension of conventions and no longer
attaches to a self, the matter is finished. One has reached freedom and
ease; to cling to a notion of no-self is unnecessary. The abandonment of
clinging is the end: nothing else is seized. With nothing seized there
is nothing to be relinquished, as confirmed by the Buddha’s words:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>That which is clung to does not exist; where then is there something
to relinquish?</p>
<p><em>Natthi attā kuto nirattaṃ vā.</em></p>
<p><em>Sn. 180; explained at Nd. I. 352-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Even the expression ‘clinging to a self’ is strictly incorrect. Since
the self is only a conventional reality, the proper expression is
‘clinging to an idea of self’. Our task is to cease grasping the belief
in or concept of self. The self does not need to be relinquished,
because there is no self that can be possessed; how then can it be
relinquished?</p>
<p>To believe in a self is to form a concept and superimpose it on reality.
The teaching enjoins us to abandon forming such a fixed image. If one
fails to do this, then although one has let go of certain conditions,
one will fasten a concept or ‘deposit’ of self onto something else,
obscuring or distorting its true nature. Therefore, the necessary tasks
are to eliminate the attachment to previous notions of self, to refrain
from attaching to anything else as self, and to avoid clinging to
no-self (<em>nirattā</em>). Then only the Truth remains, which is neither
concerned with nor dependent on personal beliefs and attachments. {107}</p>
<p>Since the self is an idea and a conventional entity established for
facilitating communication, if one fully comprehends the self, and makes
use of it without clinging, then it is not destructive. Likewise, if one
formerly attached to an image of self, the teachings insist on
abandoning this attachment. Without attachment, the matter is finished;
it is unnecessary to identify with anything else. It is unnecessary to
seize anything as self or to seek a self elsewhere.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Buddha taught to cease clinging only to the self that has
already been attached to, which means to cease clinging to the five
aggregates. Once the self is no longer attached to, the question of self
ends. Thereafter, it is a matter of attaining the Truth, which does
exist. A self, however, has no bearing on Truth, and therefore Truth is
described as <em>anattā</em>: nonself. Those who have realized the Truth are
free from any belief in self; they no longer need to believe in self or
no-self. Knowing what is non-existent as non-existent, the matter is
finished; thenceforth, there is arrival at the Truth, the Unconditioned,
for which a self no longer has any significance.</p>
<p>One harmful consequence of clinging to a self, or believing in an image
of self, is that one concludes that the self is the agent, with power to
control events. When the notion of self becomes most subtle, a sovereign
universal Self is envisaged, as the Creator of all things. This Creator
is imagined as intervening in the causal process, despite such
intervention being unnecessary.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary because nature exists autonomously; interrelated
conditioned dynamics function independently, without requiring a
Creator. Therefore, rather than say that a Creator, a God, must exist as
a prerequisite for the genesis of all things, it should be granted that
natural phenomena themselves are the primordial reality (since natural
phenomena are reciprocally created in line with causality; simply
speaking, they create each other.) One need not then be troubled with
questions of the past such as, ‘What existed before God?’ ‘Who created
God?’ or ‘From where does God come?’</p>
<p>It is neither necessary nor true to say that natural phenomena or causal
dynamics require a creator God to exist. If a God were truly the
creator, the result would be two overlapping systems: God and nature.
The course of nature would need to wait for the creative act of God.
Natural dynamics subject to divine designs would be unwieldy, however,
since things must proceed in accord with interrelated causes and
conditions within their own system. Acts of God would interfere and
obstruct the continual causal flow of phenomena.</p>
<p>Moreover, as God’s temperament can vacillate, things would be affected
accordingly; at one moment God would have them be one way, and in the
next moment another. As a consequence, nature would have even less
opportunity to follow causality, ending in great confusion and chaos.
This is not, however, the way things actually are; natural dynamics
occur in conformity with their conditionality.</p>
<p>Some people may say that nature follows laws, and that God created or
established these laws. In that case the laws must be uncertain, liable
to change at any time, and untrustworthy, because the ordainer of the
laws would abide beyond the laws; such a Being could modify the laws as
desired. These laws, however, have invariably remained constant. {108}</p>
<p>The existence of a Creator of the laws is unnecessary and improbable,
because nature must proceed in a specific fashion. Natural conditions
accord with causes and are ‘just so’ (<em>tathatā</em>): they are not and could
not be otherwise (<em>avitthatā</em>). The laws themselves are only
descriptions, which we form by observing specific natural occurrences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the absence of a creator God and the autonomy of causal
dynamics also resolves another question: Ultimate Reality, or the
Unconditioned, is absolute; it does not meddle as the Creator of
phenomena or interfere with conditioned processes. (From this
perspective, Nibbāna cannot be God, no matter how much some people try
to equate them, unless one is willing to redefine the meaning of
‘God’).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn74">74</a></sup></p>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances, it is natural for people to believe in a
self and in a Creator of the world, because things ostensibly require an
agent or creator to come into being. Seeing through this false belief to
underlying causality is difficult. Therefore, in former times people
believed that gods were the sole causes behind lightning, winds, floods
and earthquakes. It is not strange then that religious seekers and
philosophers have believed in a soul and a Creator. Clever individuals
have created more refined, all-embracing concepts, but essentially they
have been stuck at the same point.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s release from self-identification (despite the probability
that he would get ensnared in more refined notions of self), his
revelation that the world functions without a Creator, and his discovery
of the nonself and non-creative Unconditioned count as enormous
advancements in human wisdom. This realization is the escape from the
massive pitfall that has trapped human beings.</p>
<p>Despite understanding the principles of impermanence and <em>dukkha</em>, the
great philosophers before the Buddha were hampered by the belief in a
self or soul. The principle of nonself is therefore extremely difficult
to see. The Buddha tended to use the characteristics of impermanence and
<em>dukkha</em> to signal and explain <em>anattā</em>. The commentators recognized the
need to explain selflessness by way of impermanence and <em>dukkha</em>, and
valued this major advance in wisdom as a revelation not found before or
outside Buddhism, as is illustrated by the following passages:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn75">75</a></sup>
{109}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The Sammāsambuddha explained the characteristic of not-self by way of
impermanence, by way of dukkha, or by way of both. In this sutta, the
Buddha explains the characteristic of not-self by way of impermanence
thus: ‘Bhikkhus, if someone were to say, ‘the eye (ear, etc.) is self,
this would be unsuitable [because] the rise and decline of the eye
is apparent; seeing such rise and decline that person would conclude:
‘My self arises and deteriorates.’ For this reason saying, ‘the eye is
self’, is unsuitable. Thus the eye is not-self.’</p>
<p><em>In reference to M. III. 282.</em></p>
<p>The Perfectly Enlightened Buddha explained the characteristic of
nonself in this sutta by referring to dukkha thus: ‘Bhikkhus, the body
is not-self. If this body were self, then it would not be subject to
disease (i.e. oppression – <em>dukkha</em>), and it would be possible to
have it of the body: ‘May my body be this way, may my body not be that
way.’ But because the body is not-self, therefore the body is subject
to disease, and it is not possible to have it of the body: ‘May my
body be this way, may my body not be that way.’</p>
<p><em>In reference to S. III. 66.</em></p>
<p>The Perfectly Enlightened Buddha explained the characteristic of
nonself in the suttas by referring to both impermanence and dukkha,
for example: ‘Bhikkhus, material form is impermanent. Whatever is
impermanent is dukkha. Whatever is dukkha is nonself. Whatever is
nonself should be seen with perfect wisdom, as it really is, thus:
‘This is not mine’, ‘I am not this’, ‘this is not my self’.</p>
<p><em>In reference to, e.g.: S. III. 22.</em></p>
<p>Why did the Buddha explain in this way? Because impermanence and
dukkha are manifest (they are easily observed). Indeed, when a cup,
bowl or other object slips from the hand and shatters, people exclaim,
‘Oh, how fleeting!’ Impermanence is therefore described as apparent.
When a boil or blister forms on the body, or a thorn pricks a person,
he exclaims, ‘Oh, how painful!’ Dukkha is thus described as apparent.
<em>Anattā</em>, however, is not apparent, it is not conspicuous; it is
difficult to comprehend, difficult to explain, and difficult to
describe.</p>
<p>Whether Tathāgatas arise or not, the characteristics of impermanence
and dukkha are apparent, but the characteristic of nonself remains
hidden unless a Buddha arises; it is evident only during the time of a
Buddha. Truly, the religious ascetics and wanderers with great psychic
powers, like the teacher Sarabhaṅga, were able to describe
impermanence and dukkha, but were unable to describe nonself. If
Sarabhaṅga, for example, had been able to describe nonself to his
gathered community, that assembly would have been able to realize path
and fruit. Indeed, revealing the characteristic of selflessness is not
within the capability of anyone other than the Omniscient Buddhas. In
this sense, the characteristic of nonself is not apparent. {110}</p>

</div>
<h2><a class="header" href="#ego-and-conceit" id="ego-and-conceit">Ego and Conceit</a></h2>
<p>Confusion exists, especially in the Thai language, about certain terms
pertaining to the self and an attachment to self, so it seems
appropriate to add a brief explanation at this point. The terms that
pose a difficulty are <em>attā</em> and <em>māna</em>.</p>
<p><em>Attā</em> in Pali, or <em>ātman</em> in Sanskrit, translates as ‘self’ or ‘soul’.
Buddha-Dhamma teaches that this self does not truly exist, but that it
is assumed by people for convenient communication and mutual recognition
with respect to composite forms.</p>
<p>The self becomes a problem when people mistakenly believe that they
really possess a self or truly exist as a self, which is a result of not
fully comprehending the truth or being deceived by conventional reality.</p>
<p>To resolve this question of self, one should be aware that the self is
not a defilement; it is not something that must be relinquished. As a
self does not truly exist, there is thus no self that one can abandon.
The self exists only as a belief. Our responsibility is to fully
understand the truth that no self exists, which is to fully comprehend
conventional truth. In other words, the practice concerning the
purported self consists only of abandoning the belief in and
identification with self, or eliminating delusions and false notions of
self.</p>
<p>In the previous reference to the Sutta-Nipāta, the Buddha used the words
<em>attā</em> and <em>nirattā</em>. The commentaries developed the meaning of <em>attā</em>
in this case as ‘attachment to a self’ or ‘belief in a self’, with
another connotation as ‘something grasped’. This was paired with
<em>nirattā</em>, defined as ‘belief in no-self’ or ‘belief in the annihilation
of self’, with an additional connotation as ‘something to be
relinquished’.</p>
<p>The definition of <em>attā</em> in this case goes beyond its ordinary
perimeter; it stresses a person’s view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>), namely, harbouring a
view of a self, which is called <em>atta-diṭṭhi</em> or <em>attānudiṭṭhi</em>. This is
the eternalist view of having a permanent self as core or essence.
Therefore, the explanatory passages from the Mahāniddesa and Cūḷaniddesa
mentioned above define <em>attā</em> as ‘belief in self’ (<em>atta-diṭṭhi</em>) or
eternalism (<em>sassata-diṭṭhi</em>). As <em>attā</em> in this case refers to ‘wrong
view’, which is a defilement to be abandoned, there are Pali verses in
the Sutta-Nipāta describing the relinquishment of self, for example:
<em>One who has relinquished the self</em> (<em>attañjaho</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn76">76</a></sup> and <em>having
relinquished the self</em> (<em>attaṃ pahāya</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn77">77</a></sup></p>
<p>There exists another form of belief concerning self, which differs from
the holding to a view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>). <em>Diṭṭhi</em> here is the belief that one
possesses or exists as a self, for example identifying with something or
viewing the self as permanent. The other form of belief relating to self
is an appraisal; it is belief in the comparisons of oneself to others,
the self-evaluations and self-judgements, for example: ‘I am this way’,
‘this is just who I am’, ‘I am better’, ‘I am worse’, ‘we are inferior’,
or ‘we are equal’. The specific term <em>māna</em> is used for such belief,
which translates as conceit, pride, arrogance, or the self-appraisal as
better, worse or equal in comparison to others.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn78">78</a></sup> <em>Māna</em>, like
<em>diṭṭhi</em>, is a defilement, something that should be relinquished or
removed.</p>
<p>In Thailand, some people currently use the word <em>attā</em> in the meaning of
<em>māna</em>, for example: ‘She has much <em>attā</em>’ and ‘his <em>attā</em> is big’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn79">79</a></sup>
{111} One should be aware that using <em>attā</em> in this way is simply a
current custom, but is technically incorrect. The proper word to use in
this context is <em>māna</em>, which is the principal defilement causing
defiance, disagreement, boasting, competition, and even persecution.</p>
<p>Note also that even the belief in being equal to others is conceit and a
defilement, just like considering oneself better or worse. As long as
such comparisons exist, the mind is still subject to prejudice,
condescension, overconfidence and inflation. These assumptions may be
inaccurate or based upon the truth, but the mind is not yet free and
clear. The end of conceit occurs with knowledge of the truth; despite
being aware of superiority, inferiority or equality, if the knowledge is
unadulterated by clinging, then it is not conceit or defilement.</p>
<p>To sum up, <em>attā</em> and <em>anattā</em> are matters to be understood with wisdom.
If one lacks a true understanding of phenomena, one misunderstands them
and believes that a true, substantial self exists. This is the rise of
wrong view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>). One must rectify this misunderstanding with
wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). Our only responsibility in this respect is to develop
understanding. When one truly understands that phenomena do not possess
a fixed, substantial self – that only conventional labels of self exist
– any doubts or problems pertaining to self cease accordingly.</p>
<p><em>Māna</em> is a matter of the mind – of emotions. It is a negative emotion
(a form of defilement), whereby the mind seeks self-importance. One
exalts oneself and disparages others. The mind is blemished, in
conflict, inflated, closed, and anxious. These attributes of the mind
need to be remedied. Our responsibility in this context is to train the
mind, to abandon and dispel this conceit, to develop such traits as
politeness, gentleness and humility, and to value others and give them
respect.</p>
<p><em>Māna</em> is a matter connected to ethical conduct. One needs to abstain
from conceit and arrogance and to resist mental defilement. <em>Attā</em>, on
the contrary, is a matter pertaining to the truth. It is rectified when
wisdom recognizes the selfless nature of phenomena.</p>
<p>These two tasks, however, are essentially connected. When one discerns
the characteristic of nonself and lets go of a belief in self, one
abandons conceit. The wisdom inherent in this discernment frees the mind
from arrogance, haughtiness, self-importance, and such self-comparisons
as being better or worse than others: one is free from <em>māna</em>.</p>
<p>To quote the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>One who perceives all things as nonself arrives at the removal of
pride that says ‘I am’ (<em>asmi-māna</em>), and attains Nibbāna here and
now. {112}</p>
<p><em>A. IV. 353, 358; Ud. 37.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h2><a class="header" href="#practical-value" id="practical-value">Practical Value</a></h2>
<p>From a practical point of view, the teachings touch on impermanence more
than the other characteristics, because impermanence is more apparent.
The state of pressure, stress and friction – <em>dukkhatā</em> – is
moderately difficult to observe and is therefore referred to less. The
characteristic of nonself is the most subtle and difficult to see, and
is referred to the least. The more obvious sign of impermanence is used
as a foundation to explain the characteristics of <em>dukkha</em> and nonself.</p>
<p>The following two verses of the Buddha, which highlight impermanence,
show the value of the Three Characteristics for Dhamma practice:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Indeed, all conditioned things are impermanent, prone to arise and
pass away. Having arisen, they cease; their coming to rest is truest
bliss.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn80">80</a></sup></p>
<p><em>D. II. 199; S. II. 193; spoken by others at D. II. 157; S. I. 6, 158;
Ap. 385.</em></p>
<p>Monks, all conditioned things are of a nature to decay; strive to
attain the goal by diligence.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn81">81</a></sup></p>
<p><em>D. II. 120</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Note that the first verse describes the state in which conditioned
things (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) are stilled, that is, it refers to Nibbāna. It
describes how Nibbāna is not subject to change; it is not subject to
rising and falling, to dissolution and disintegration. It is a state of
true happiness. This verse (<em>aniccā vata saṅkhārā...</em>) is very
frequently chanted and cited, to the extent that it has become an
important part of the Theravada tradition. In relation to ordinary
people, this verse is linked to practical application; it is defined in
such a way that people can benefit from contemplating the stilling of
conditioned things evident in their own lives.</p>
<p>The first verse thus advocates a proper relationship to the world and to
life in general: the value of thoroughly comprehending that all things
are compounded, unstable, and subject to change; they cannot be
commanded at will, they accord with causes, and they exist ‘just so’.
With this knowledge a person maintains an appropriate attitude towards
life and clinging ceases. Despite alteration, decay and disappearance of
cherished objects, the mind is not overwhelmed and disturbed; it remains
clear, radiant and joyful on account of its innate wisdom, which leads
to true peace. This verse emphasizes liberation of the heart –
transcendence – which is the benefit of spiritual practice.</p>
<p>The second verse calls attention to virtuous conduct, which is conducive
to the realization of the supreme state. This realization stems from the
knowledge that all things are ephemeral and subject to stress. {113}
Flux is perpetual, relentless, and inexorable. Human life especially is
fleeting, uncertain and unreliable. Knowing this, one makes effort in
that which should be done and refrains from that which should be
avoided. One does not procrastinate or waste opportunities. One strives
to rectify harmful situations, takes heed to protect oneself from
further damage, and cultivates virtue by reflecting with wisdom, which
accords with conditions. As a result, one fulfils one’s responsibilities
and attains one’s goals. This verse emphasizes diligence and careful
attention, which are mundane and practical qualities. These qualities
are the benefit of proper conduct.</p>
<p>One should apply this second, engaged course of action to all levels of
human affairs, from personal to social issues, from secular to spiritual
matters, and from earning a living to seeking the enlightened truth of
the Buddha. The following teachings of the Buddha highlight this
quality:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, considering personal wellbeing, you should accomplish it with
care. Considering others’ wellbeing, you should accomplish it with
care. Considering the wellbeing of both, you should accomplish it with
care.</p>
<p><em>S. II. 29; A. IV. 134-5.</em></p>
<p>There is one quality, Great King, which secures dual welfare, both
present (visible) welfare, and future (subtle) welfare.... This
quality is heedfulness (<em>appamāda</em>).... A wise person who is heedful
secures dual welfare, both present and future. The steadfast one, by
securing [these two] benefits, is called a sage.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn82">82</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. I. 86-7</em></p>
<p>Monks, a person of good moral conduct, perfect in moral conduct,
through careful attention to his affairs, gains much wealth.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn83">83</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. III. 253</em></p>
<p>By earnest endeavour (<em>appamāda</em>), monks, I attained enlightenment.
And you too, monks, if you put forth undeterred effort ... in no long
time you shall realize the goal of the holy life by way of superior
wisdom in this very life.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 50.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The two benefits, derived from spiritual practice and from proper
conduct, are mutually supportive. By their consummation through right
training a person obtains supreme wellbeing. {114}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-spiritual-practice-leading-to-liberation" id="the-spiritual-practice-leading-to-liberation">The Spiritual Practice Leading to Liberation</a></h3>
<p>Spiritual benefit, and the practice for its fulfilment, relates directly
to the highest goal of Buddha-Dhamma. It is of utmost importance,
concerning the entire spectrum of Buddhist teachings. Because many
details of its development require special understanding, the texts
refer to it frequently and at length. Some texts, for example the
Visuddhimagga, outline this development as an ordered system. Rather
than describe specifics here, I will only offer a broad summary.</p>
<p>Those people who discern the three characteristics grow in wisdom and
acquire a clearer understanding of life. In addition, they normally
undergo two important transformative mental stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stage 1</strong>: Once a person understands conditionality more clearly,
and has gained an intermediate insight into impermanence, <em>dukkha</em>
and nonself, a reaction occurs. A feeling arises unlike any feeling
previously experienced. Whereas formerly the person was captivated
and delighted by sense objects, having now discerned the three
characteristics sentiment changes into discontentment and aversion,
and sometimes into disgust. At this stage emotions are predominant
over wisdom. Despite the deficiency of wisdom and the remainder of
mental bias, this stage is nonetheless important and occasionally
even crucial for escaping from the power of attachment and for
attaining the perfection in stage 2. Conversely, by stopping at this
point a person’s prejudice can be harmful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stage 2</strong>: At this stage a person has cultivated a thorough
understanding of reality: wisdom has entered the stage of
completion. All feelings of repulsion disappear, replaced by a
feeling of equanimity. There exists neither infatuation nor disgust,
neither attachment nor aversion. There remains only a lucid
understanding of things as they truly are, along with a feeling of
spaciousness. A person is able to act appropriately and judiciously.
This level of mental development, included in the practice of
insight meditation (<em>vipassanā</em>), is called ‘equanimous knowledge of
formations’ (<em>saṅkhārupekkhā-ñāṇa</em>). It is a necessary stage of
direct realization of truth and of the complete freedom of the
heart.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two important fruits of liberation, especially when liberation
is complete (in stage 2):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Freedom from suffering</strong>: liberated individuals are relieved of
all harm resulting from clinging. Their happiness exists independent
of alluring material objects. The mind is unrestricted, joyous,
fearless, and sorrowless. It is not stricken by the vacillations of
worldly conditions (<em>lokadhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn84">84</a></sup> {115} This feature affects
ethics as well since these people do not create problems by venting
unhappiness on others, which is a significant cause for social
conflict. They develop spiritual qualities, notably lovingkindness
and compassion, which act for the welfare of all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Absence of defilement</strong>: liberated persons are free from the power
of mental defilement, e.g. greed, anger, covetousness, prejudice,
confusion, jealousy, and conceit. Their minds are clear, unfettered,
calm and pure. This feature has direct influence on behaviour, both
individual and social. Personally, they apply wisdom in an
unadulterated way; they are not biased by aversion or selfish
ambition. Externally, they do not commit offences prompted by
defilement. They perform wholesome actions righteously and without
hesitation since no defilements like laziness or self-centredness
impede and disturb.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, when still not fully developed and existing in isolation
(i.e. when not supported by the practice of heedfulness), spiritual
practice can still be harmful since the good can be a cause for
unskilfulness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn85">85</a></sup> Having attained some spiritual advances and found
peace and happiness, people are likely to revel in this happiness. They
are likely to rest on their laurels, abandon effort, or neglect
unfinished responsibilities. In short, they fall into heedlessness, as
confirmed by the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And how, Nandiya, is a noble disciple one who dwells negligently?
Here, Nandiya, a noble disciple possesses firm confidence in the
Buddha ... the Dhamma ... and the Sangha.... He possesses the virtues
dear to the noble ones.... Content with this firm confidence ... with
these virtues, he does not make further effort.... In this way,
Nandiya, a noble disciple dwells negligently.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 398.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The way to avoid such harm is to integrate the second practice.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-practice-of-heedfulness" id="the-practice-of-heedfulness">The Practice of Heedfulness</a></h3>
<p>Out of habit, people generally follow two pathways while conducting
their affairs. When oppressed by suffering or in crisis, people hasten
to amend the situation. Sometimes they are able to solve the problem,
while at other times they cannot and must face loss or ruin. Even if
they succeed, they experience much distress and struggle to find a
lasting solution; they may even find defeat amidst their success: ‘win
the battle but lose the war’. {116}</p>
<p>While at ease in everyday life, having attended to immediate concerns,
people then become complacent, allowing the days to pass by searching
for pleasure or indulging in gratification. They do not occupy
themselves with avoiding future harm. Unless cornered, they postpone
their responsibilities. Assaulted by affliction or danger, they hasten
to find relief; having escaped, they are content to partake in their
delights. This cycle continues until one day they are powerless to alter
the course of events or are destroyed in their attempt to escape.</p>
<p>The conduct described above is referred to as <em>pamāda</em>, which can be
variously translated as negligence, heedlessness, laxness, disregard,
lack of effort, and lethargy. It tends to go hand in hand with laziness.</p>
<p>The opposite quality is referred to as <em>appamāda</em> (’diligence’;
‘heedfulness’),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn86">86</a></sup> which is roused and guided by mindfulness. Diligent
persons are continually aware of what must be avoided and what must be
pursued, and commit themselves to these tasks. They recognize the
importance of time, of work, and of the slightest responsibility. They
are not intoxicated or overly enthralled by life. They make every effort
to avoid transgression and miss no opportunity to grow in virtue. They
hasten towards their goal or towards the good without interruption, and
take great care in their preparations.</p>
<p>There are three important attributes of heedfulness (<em>appamāda</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One recognizes the importance of every moment; one does not allow
opportunities to pass by in vain; one uses time in the most valuable
and beneficial way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One is not intoxicated, indulgent, reckless, or forgetful. One is
constantly vigilant in order to avoid making careless mistakes or
falling into corrupt or evil ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One hastens to cultivate virtue and create wellbeing; one endeavours
in one’s duties and responsibilities and one acts thoroughly; one
strives to develop the mind and foster wisdom. (This factor is
referred to as ‘heedfulness in regard to all virtuous qualities’.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An understanding of the Three Characteristics directly promotes
diligence, because when one knows that all things are impermanent,
unstable, fleeting, non-compliant, and subject to causes, then only one
way of practice remains, which is to act in conformity with causes and
conditions. This means that one makes effort to protect oneself from
unwholesome influences, to repair damage, to preserve beneficial
qualities, and to act meritoriously for further progress. This practice
involves investigating causality and acting accordingly. For example,
aware that all things are subject to change, one strives to act in such
a way that desired salutary conditions increase and exist as long as
possible, and that they give the maximum benefit to others. {117}</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, one sees that the real cause for, or force
behind, this diligence is suffering. People’s relationship to suffering,
however, affects their reaction to it, resulting in either heedlessness
or care. And even careful responses vary in quality. An analysis of this
dynamic will show the value of <em>appamāda</em>. There are three ways to
respond to suffering:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Conduct based on the strain of suffering:</em> some people indulge in
comfort and pleasure, neglect their responsibilities, do not
consider potential danger, but rather wait until danger confronts
them. Faced with trouble and necessity, they hasten to remedy the
situation, sometimes successfully, sometimes not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Conduct based on fear of suffering:</em> some people fear suffering and
difficulty, and so strive to prevent hardship. Although their
attempts to establish more security are usually successful, their
minds are burdened by anxiety. Besides fearing suffering, they
suffer from fear, and they act prompted by this secondary source of
distress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Conduct based on knowledge of suffering:</em> some people reflect with
wisdom on how to manage with potential suffering. They are not
intimidated by fear since they understand the nature of the three
characteristics; they recognize potential danger. They investigate
the dynamics of change, relying on the awareness of impermanence and
the liberty and flexibility afforded by the characteristic of
nonself, to choose the best way forward. In addition, they use past
experience as a lesson to prevent suffering and to steer towards the
greatest possible good. They are relieved of as much suffering as is
in their power, to the point of being free from all mental suffering
and anxiety.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first type of behaviour is heedless; types two and three are
performed with care, but type two is a caution fed by defilement and
thus bound up with suffering. Type three, on the other hand, springs
from wisdom, and is therefore trouble-free: no mental suffering arises.
This is full and proper heedfulness, which only an arahant practises
perfectly. The quality of vigilance for unawakened persons depends on
their ability to apply wisdom (in line with type three), and on the
reduction of stress caused by fear and anxiety (of type two).</p>
<p>As described above, ordinary people are not the only ones susceptible to
heedlessness; persons in the initial stages of enlightenment can be
careless as well. The reason for this carelessness is contentment,
satisfaction, or complacency concerning exceptional qualities that they
have attained. They delight in happiness and ease, and abandon their
spiritual work. {118}</p>
<p>Another reason is that they have perceived the three characteristics;
they have a profound understanding of change, they are reconciled to
conditionality, and they are not troubled by decay and separation.
Because of this ease and reconciliation, they stop; they show no further
interest and make no effort to deal with unresolved issues. They neglect
the necessary tasks for prevention or improvement, allowing problems to
simply remain or even worsen.</p>
<p>In this case, the attainment of spiritual benefit, or of (initial)
liberation, is the grounds for carelessness. These individuals act
incorrectly; their practice is one-sided and incomplete, lacking the
effort required to achieve the full value of heedfulness. To rectify
this situation, they must be aware of both benefits, the spiritual and
the practical, and bring them to completion.</p>
<p>Thorough knowledge of things based on an understanding of the three
characteristics loosens or releases clinging to things. This
non-clinging is at the heart of liberation and freedom from suffering,
leading to the ultimate goal of Buddhism.</p>
<p>One cause for heedless behaviour is attaching to non-attachment. In
proper practice letting go occurs by itself; it is a consequence of
clearly seeing things according to the truth of the Three
Characteristics. Some people, however, do not yet have this lucid
discernment; they have simply heard about this truth and rationalize
about it, forming a half-baked understanding. Furthermore, they hold on
to the idea that by grasping nothing whatsoever they will be released
from suffering.</p>
<p>Thinking in this way, they try to prove to themselves and others that
they do not attach to anything, or are free of defilement, to the extent
of taking nothing seriously (see
Note <a href="#note-indifference">Indifference</a>). The result is functional imbalance,
inattentiveness, and negligence. This is attachment to non-attachment:
it is a counterfeit non-attachment.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Indifference</span><a id="note-indifference"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not desiring anything is good, but one must be very careful of
indifference. Acting without wishing for personal reward is
praiseworthy as it demonstrates that one is not controlled by craving;
but indifference can easily turn into neglect. Neglect is equivalent
to heedlessness, misjudgement, and craving, which leads a person to
indulge in ease and comfort. At the very least indifference indicates
a lack of wholesome enthusiasm (<em>kusala-chanda</em>), which is the first
step to all virtue.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A comparison of activities prompted by different motivations helps to
highlight the activity prompted by heedfulness. Compare the four kinds
of activity and inactivity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some people do not act if they receive no personal advantage or if
they will lose an advantage. They act to gain or to protect an
advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people do not act because they attach to non-attachment: they
abstain from acting to show that they are free of defilement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people do not act as a result of carelessness, delighting in
contentment and ease. Unafflicted by suffering, or resigned to
conditionality, they are complacent. {119}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people act or refrain from acting dependent on wise
consideration of the circumstances. Knowing that something should be
done, they act even if they gain no advantage. Knowing that
something should not be done, they refrain even if by acting they
would gain an advantage. When action is called for, they act
immediately, without hesitation or delay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The fourth kind is proper action performed with pure mindfulness and
wisdom.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s guidelines for heedful action are twofold, concerning both
internal and external activities. The former are the exhortations to
spiritual development, to make effort towards higher states of
consciousness, which is equal to attaining the spiritual benefit from
the Three Characteristics or the liberation of the heart. In brief, this
activity is ‘personal improvement’. The latter are the teachings for
daily life and interaction with the world: the urging for diligence in
work, the fulfilment of responsibilities, the solution and prevention of
problems, the development of virtue, and the fostering of social
wellbeing. In brief, this is ‘social improvement’.</p>
<p>The teachings of heedfulness encourage contemplation on three periods of
time: the past, in order to draw lessons from past events and
experiences, and to use these lessons as incentives for further effort;
the present, for greater urgency in one’s activities, for not
postponing, and for making the most of each moment; and the future, to
reflect on potential change, both beneficial and destructive, by using
wisdom to examine causality, followed by plans to prevent harm and
advance the good.</p>
<p>Compared with the Buddha’s spiritual teachings, the practical teachings
are fewer and of less detail; they are found scattered throughout the
scriptures and tend to be concise. The reason for this is that human
activities vary greatly according to time and place; they cannot be
described with any uniformity. Therefore, the Buddha merely presented
principles or examples. In contrast, the transformation of the heart
pertains to all human beings: the nature of the human mind is identical
for all. Furthermore, this transformation is profound and difficult to
realize, and is the unique aspect of the Buddha’s teaching. He thus
explained it thoroughly. {120}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#correlation-between-the-practice-of-liberation-and-the-practice-of-heedfulness" id="correlation-between-the-practice-of-liberation-and-the-practice-of-heedfulness">Correlation Between the Practice of Liberation and the Practice of Heedfulness</a></h3>
<p>The spiritual practice for liberation supports the practice of
heedfulness by promoting purity of action. Liberated persons act with a
pure heart, not driven by defilement. The practice for liberation also
fosters a sense of joy in a person’s activities. It releases people from
the stress, agitation and worry that results from actions stemming from
unwholesome mind states, for example action done out of fear or
competitiveness. Instead, people act with serenity and joy. In addition,
when people see the value of deliverance and mental wellbeing, they
perform external activities to promote a just and peaceful life. In
brief, material progress goes hand in hand with spiritual development.</p>
<p>Heedfulness similarly complements the practice for liberation.
Generally, when people are at ease they become heedless, by becoming
idle and slack in their effort. People who profit materially or who
solve external problems are not the only ones who become careless when
they are prosperous and comfortable. Those who have reconciled
themselves to impermanence, <em>dukkha</em> and nonself, whose hearts are at
ease, also tend to become attached to happiness and cease making effort.
They no longer attend to unresolved matters, and do not urge themselves
to improve either personal or social circumstances. The active value of
the Three Characteristics based on heedfulness prevents this stagnation
and motivates these individuals to persevere.</p>
<p>In short, these two practices must be united for Dhamma practice to be
correct. Spiritual progress then inspires virtuous and joyful action,
while people’s deeds nurture further spiritual development. Proper
practice is free from acting with a troubled mind and free from
complacency. People act with ease, and this ease does not become an
obstacle for subsequent effort. As a result spiritual realization
safeguards action and action enhances spiritual realization. In unison,
perfection is reached. {121}</p>
<p>Spiritual qualities and active, heedful qualities both depend on wisdom,
which discerns the three characteristics, leads to non-attachment,
surrender, relinquishment, and liberation. The deeper the understanding,
the greater is the freedom and higher the realization. For example, by
accessing jhāna or gaining an insight, a person is able to perceive the
impermanence, <em>dukkha</em>, and nonself in the bliss of these conditions,
and they neither cling to the bliss nor to the attainments.</p>
<p>In practical affairs, wisdom rouses people to act with diligence and to
make the most of each opportunity. An understanding of the law of
causality prompts a person to investigate causes to solve problems at
their root and to act in harmony with this law. This knowledge includes
analyzing causes of past events so that one learns from them, and
recognizing the necessary conditions for preventing harm and promoting
wellbeing.</p>
<p>The two ways of practice reveal the supreme importance of the teaching
on the Three Characteristics. The first way of practice highlights
wisdom, which penetrates reality by comprehending the Three
Characteristics. The second way of practice points to diligent action,
which springs from an understanding of this teaching. Wisdom’s task is
to realize the truth of the Three Characteristics; with this realization
the heart is freed. At the same time, the Three Characteristics motivate
a person who has some level of insight to take heed, to make further
effort, and to avoid transgression.</p>
<p>An understanding of the Three Characteristics is the source of just
action, from beginning stages of Dhamma practice to the end. Awareness
of the Three Characteristics is the motivation for heedfulness,
ingenuity, abstention from evil, and good conduct on all levels.
Ultimately, a complete understanding of the Three Characteristics
enables perfect mental freedom, which is the highest human achievement.</p>
<p>The worldly and the transcendent converge at the Three Characteristics.
Liberation of the heart is a transcendent quality; heedfulness is
mundane. The mutually supportive nature of these two principles
demonstrates that in an honourable life the worldly and the transcendent
abide in unison.</p>
<p>One sees the evidence of this clearly in the Buddha and the arahants.
Perfectly free, they represent the human ideal; and they attain this
freedom by way of heedfulness. Arahants alone are described as ‘those
who have perfected heedfulness’;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn87">87</a></sup> they are persons who have finished
their business by way of careful attention. Having attained arahantship
they continue to persevere for the welfare of the monastic community
(<em>saṅgha</em>) and of all beings. {122} One should follow the example of
these awakened ones, by realizing mental freedom and acting with
care.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn88">88</a></sup></p>
<p>The values disclosed by the Three Characteristics ensure perfect moral
conduct, with definite consequences. There are two things which
guarantee infallible moral conduct:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>A mind free from longing</em> which does not experience clinging,
craving, lust for material objects, or perverse thoughts; because
one has reached deliverance, there is freedom from defilement; there
is an end to selfishness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sublime happiness</em>, which is independent of materiality and is
accessible without moral infringement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Indeed the first quality is enough to guarantee moral impeccability. The
second is merely additional confirmation.</p>
<p>Liberation grants these two moral guarantees. A thorough understanding
of the world and an insight into the Three Characteristics leads to
freedom of the heart. Coveting and loathing, both grounds for
wrongdoing, cease. In other words, moral conduct arises automatically
since no impulse exists to act immorally.</p>
<p>Furthermore, liberation generates a profound happiness. Awakened beings
experience expansiveness and joy and some of them experience exalted
states of bliss in jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn89">89</a></sup> Experiencing such bliss, it is natural
that they are of no mind to act dishonourably for another sort of
happiness.</p>
<p>In any case, one must understand that the second guarantee of refined
happiness alone is not yet fully dependable if it is a mundane form of
happiness, for example that of jhāna, since a person who accesses these
mundane states can still revert to indulgence in gross forms of
happiness. To be truly secure, a person must obtain the first guarantee
of non-craving; otherwise, the happiness must be transcendent, which
automatically arises with the first guarantee. {123}</p>
<p>Stream-enterers (<em>sotāpanna</em>) possess these two moral guarantees; they
are impeccable in moral conduct and are incapable of moral
transgression. The scriptures refer to enlightened beings
(<em>ariya-puggala</em>), from stream-enterers upwards, as ‘perfect in moral
conduct’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn90">90</a></sup> Therefore, if we wish for ethical standards to be firmly
established in society, we must promote the realization of stream-entry;
we will thereby meet with true success.</p>
<p>If one is unable to establish these two guarantees, one’s chances for a
secure ethical society will be slim, because members of society will be
infected by defilement and thus be predisposed to violate boundaries. In
this event, systems of control and coercion need to be created, or even
excessive force be applied, which does not offer true safety or
resolution.</p>
<p>We see the lack of success of such measures everywhere. For example,
people in this day and age receive advanced education, and have learned
what is good and bad, what is beneficial and harmful. But because they
fall prey to greed (<em>lobha</em>), hatred (<em>dosa</em>), and delusion (<em>moha</em>),
they act immorally; they injure themselves (for example, by intoxication
and drug abuse) and damage society (for example, by corruption,
exploitation, and deforestation). Reasoned arguments and law enforcement
end up having minimal effect and sometimes even appear farcical.</p>
<p>When people are unable to establish the two aforementioned guarantees,
they generally use the following methods to protect or promote ethical
standards, with varying degrees of success:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Intimidation by establishing rules, laws, and punishments. Due to
evasion of these laws, new systems must be created for
reinforcement. In addition, the system itself may be flawed, for
example with corruption. As a result, the attempts to maintain
ethical standards meet with ever diminishing success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intimidation with threats of occult power, for example of gods and
supernatural forces. This is successful during times when people
believe in these forces, but is less effective when people have the
sort of scientific understanding present today. This form of
intimidation includes instilling the fear of going to hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intimidation with threats against a person’s honour and popularity,
for example applying social pressure of blame and disrepute. This
works for some but not for others, and is indecisive at best (this
will drive some people, for example, to act in secret.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Catering to desire by using a reward or compensation, either from
people, gods, or occult powers, including the promise of heaven.
This method is variously effective, according to time and place, and
its results are uncertain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An appeal to virtue and righteousness, by encouraging a sense of
shame, self-respect and mindfulness. Few people possess these
qualities in strength; people usually submit to desire and therefore
their moral conduct is inconsistent. The protection bestowed by this
motivation is especially weak in an age abounding in temptation and
base values. {124}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An appeal to faith, by fixing the mind with strong conviction on an
ideal. This is difficult to accomplish, and even when successful it
is unreliable, because faith is dependent on something external.
Faith is not direct knowledge and sole reliance on faith is still
tainted by defilement. Occasionally, this defilement intensifies and
then enshrouds faith, or faith wanes and disappears on its own.
(This method includes the concentrative power in preliminary stages
of mind deliverance – <em>cetovimutti</em>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applying the power of wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>), by encouraging an
interest in the development of virtue. This force is the adversary
of craving, which is the agent behind immoral behaviour. If one
cannot yet cultivate the heart’s liberation, one should emphasize
the rousing of such desire and enthusiasm, as it is a wholesome
force, is conjoined with wisdom, and supports liberation more
directly than any of the other methods mentioned above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of which impetus or motivation one uses, Dhamma practice must
rely on self-restraint (<em>saññama</em>) to achieve moral rectitude.
Therefore, to foster ethical conduct people should be trained in strict
self-discipline.</p>
<p>Of all the motivations listed above, the summoning of virtuous
qualities, faith, and enthusiasm are best, but one must remember that
these forces are unable to provide definite results. A truly stable
ethical society only exists when people establish the two moral
guarantees: a free heart and sublime happiness, which generate moral
integrity automatically.</p>
<p>One can use heedfulness as a measuring stick for Dhamma practice by
comparing oneself to the arahants, who combine consummate liberation
with perfect diligence. They integrate knowledge of the truth with pure
conduct, non-attachment with earnest effort, and transcendent
realization with responsible action in the world. They reveal how two
apparently discordant elements can exist in harmony and be mutually
supportive.</p>
<p>Heedfulness is the core of all righteous conduct and is the incentive
behind all virtuous acts from beginning to end. As the Buddha said,
heedfulness is like an elephant’s footprint, which covers the footprints
of all other animals; it dictates the function of all other virtues. All
virtues depend on heedfulness; regardless of all the virtues described
in the scriptures, carelessness alone suppresses and invalidates them as
if they did not exist. Virtues are truly effective when heedfulness is
established.</p>
<p>For ordinary people, however, diligence tends to be weakened or
interrupted due to their preoccupation with alluring sense objects.
Craving causes laziness, worry, and procrastination. People’s conduct is
thus continually wanting or fruitless. {125}</p>
<p>Conversely, the greater the heart’s liberation, the less a person
indulges in delusory sense objects, and the more assiduous that person
is, unimpaired by defilement. Freedom and earnest effort support one
another in this way.</p>
<p>In addition, the principle of heedfulness is a reminder that all
persons, including noble ones (<em>ariya</em>) in initial stages of awakening,
are still vulnerable as long as they have not realized arahantship. They
may become heedless by grasping the ease and contentment stemming from
their attainments: their virtues induce them to err. Therefore, we must
constantly remind ourselves to take care, and to promote a sense of
urgency (<em>saṁvega</em>).</p>
<p>In any community there are people who succumb to heedlessness. Offering
friendship and encouraging others to be prudent is one duty of a
diligent person. The presence of a ‘beautiful friend’ (<em>kalyāṇa-mitta</em>)
is a key factor which is paired with caution as an antidote when all
other virtues are defunct during a period of foolhardiness, and as an
answer to the question: Having been careless, what are the alternatives
to simply waiting to incur the painful consequences?</p>
<p>To sum up, people should take care and make earnest effort for their own
and other’s benefit and development. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Leaders of a country should make effort to establish peace and
welfare, promote a healthy, just environment, and nurture people’s
spiritual qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Religious elders should propagate the Dhamma for the welfare of the
many, act in consideration of later generations, and do everything
in their ability to preserve the true teaching (<em>saddhamma</em>) for all
beings everywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monks should perform their duties and inspire people with care; they
should create a feeling of peace and safety by not undertaking
practices of self-mortification, and by teaching the way to a
virtuous life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All persons should strive for personal wellbeing by developing
self-reliance, and for others’ wellbeing by helping them gain
self-reliance. One should cultivate wisdom to reach the highest
boon, which leads to deliverance and a life of integrity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because human beings who are momentarily untroubled, live in comfort, or
have reconciled themselves to an aspect of the truth ordinarily become
careless, skilled teachers customarily offer friendly admonishment. They
constantly seek means to encourage their followers by advising,
inspiring, and even frustrating, to establish people in heedfulness.
{126}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-value-of-liberation" id="the-value-of-liberation">The Value of Liberation</a></h3>
<p>Although the value of liberation is a component of the spiritual path,
it has several distinctive features. The scriptures define the spiritual
path and its companion practical teachings by referring to impermanence,
since impermanence is easily noticed. Even beginning Dhamma
practitioners benefit from the Three Characteristics by integrating the
spiritual and practical teachings, as befits their level of
understanding. The value of liberation, however, accompanies the
meditation on nonself (<em>anattā</em>), cf.
Note <a href="#note-liberation">Liberation</a>.</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A person sees any kind of material form ... feeling ... perception ...
volitional formation ... and consciousness, whether past, present or
future ... as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not
mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ When a person knows and
sees in this way, there exists no ‘I’-making (<em>ahaṅkāra</em>), ‘my’-making
(<em>mamaṅkāra</em>), or underlying tendency to conceit (<em>mānānusaya</em>)
regarding this body with its consciousness and all external signs.</p>
<p><em>M. III. 18-19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The defilements of <em>ahaṅkāra</em>, <em>mamaṅkāra</em> and <em>mānānusaya</em> are also
called <em>diṭṭhi</em>, <em>taṇhā</em> and <em>māna</em> respectively. As a group they are
usually arranged as <em>taṇhā</em>, <em>māna</em> and <em>diṭṭhi</em>. This quote’s
significance is that a person who clearly sees the nature of nonself
eliminates the three defilements that are tied up in a sense of self or
that create egocentricity, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Taṇhā</em>: selfishness; the search for self-gratification and personal
gain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Māna</em>: conceit, pride and self-judgement; the desire for prominence
and control over others; the pursuit of power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhi</em>: attachment to personal opinions; rigid conviction,
credulity, and infatuation concerning theories, creeds, and ideals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Liberation</span><a id="note-liberation"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The results of inquiries into impermanence, dukkha, and selflessness
are linked, so examining each of the three characteristics aids in
liberation. The chief determining factor for liberation, however, is
the understanding of nonself, as confirmed by the Buddha’s teaching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The perception of impermanence should be cultivated for the
removal of the conceit ‘I am’ (<em>asmimāna</em>). For when one perceives
impermanence, Meghiya, the perception of nonself is established. A
person who perceives nonself [in all things] accomplishes the
eradication of the conceit ‘I am’, and [realizes] Nibbāna.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Ud. 37; and see A. IV. 353, 358</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These three defilements are collectively called <em>papañca</em> or
<em>papañca-dhamma</em>, which can be translated as ‘encumbrances’. Another
translation is ‘agitators’: <em>papañca</em> produce mental proliferation and
turmoil. They cause mental disquiet, excess, delay, and confusion. They
lead a person to deviate from simple obvious truth. They breed new
problems and interfere in the reasoned solution to existent problems;
instead, they generate more complication and disorder. They dictate
human behaviour, inducing unrest, disagreement, conquest and war.</p>
<p>Such vices are not the only fruits; even if a person acts virtuously, a
hidden catch hampers behaviour when these defilements act as the
catalyst, leading people astray. {127}</p>
<p>Depending on the extent of wisdom, an understanding of the Three
Characteristics, especially the quality of selflessness, weakens or
destroys these self-obsessed defilements. Once these disturbing,
confining, and misleading agents are absent, the path to virtuous
conduct is wide open and limitless. A person can then wholeheartedly
cultivate virtues, for example goodwill, compassion, benefaction
(<em>atthacariyā</em>), and generosity.</p>
<p>In sum, insight into the Three Characteristics leads to goodness,
growth, and happiness: the goodness of great virtue, the growth of
diligence, and the happiness of wisdom, which brings about the heart’s
release.</p>
<p>Happiness is the basis on which good conduct rests. The happiness meant
here is primarily the happiness independent of material objects
(<em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>); it is a happiness that does not stagnate, sour, or
lead to harm.</p>
<p>People who have penetrated the truth of the Three Characteristics and
whose happiness is independent of material things do not become
infatuated with sensual pleasures. They do not commit ill deeds in
pursuit of such pleasure. When pleasure subsides, grief does not
overwhelm them; they are able to sustain mindfulness with minimal
disturbance. Untroubled by anxiety, they are able to partake of all
degrees of happiness fully and fluently, including enjoying the most
refined forms of bliss without attachment.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#practical-benefits-of-the-individual-characteristics" id="practical-benefits-of-the-individual-characteristics">Practical Benefits of the Individual Characteristics</a></h2>
<p>So far the practical benefits of the Three Characteristics have been
explained as a whole. Below, the benefits of each individual
characteristic are outlined:</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#impermanence-1" id="impermanence-1">Impermanence</a></h3>
<p>The teaching on impermanence describes the arising, maintaining, and
ending of all things, extending to the smallest molecule, and embracing
both mind and matter. Although people acknowledge impermanence when
witnessing the alteration of an object, even this alteration may
reinforce their belief in substantiality: they believe that an object’s
essence was formerly of one composition, now it is of another. This
misunderstanding leads people to further self-deception and
entanglement. People who have gained true insight into impermanence, on
the other hand, are no longer led astray. {128}</p>
<p>Impermanence is essentially neutral, neither good nor bad, but with
human beings one can designate some forms of change as growth and some
as decline. Regardless of which direction it goes, change depends on
causes: whatever declines can improve or can decline further; and
whatever improves can decline or can blossom further. Humans themselves
are a primary factor in this growth or decline, and are able to create
many supporting conditions.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn91">91</a></sup></p>
<p>Growth and decline therefore do not occur at random but are subject to
human participation according to people’s deeds (<em>yathā-kamma</em>). They
are subject to human actions. To prosper, one should not wait for the
interference by some imagined supernatural agent, nor should one
passively stand by, believing that things happen on their own depending
on one’s fate.</p>
<p>Impermanence thus offers people hope: if one wishes for something, one
must foster the proper conditions. Improvement is possible, both
material and spiritual; an ignorant person can become wise and an
ordinary person can be awakened. Self-improvement depends on our
understanding the causes for such change and then generating these
causes.</p>
<p>As just mentioned, growth is susceptible to decline. One must take care
to prevent the conditions for decline, and foster the conditions for
growth. A person who has fallen into decline can rectify the situation
by abandoning the detrimental factors and nurturing the beneficial ones.
Moreover, spiritual growth can be enhanced to the point that one
realizes the complete end of spiritual regression.</p>
<p>Here we come to the supreme quality that links the truth with human
conduct: wisdom. Wisdom is necessary to differentiate between decline
and true growth, to know which factors are necessary for desired change,
and to develop the skills for supporting these factors.</p>
<p>The teaching on impermanence is thus of great import for human conduct.
It offers the potential for improvement, it confirms the law of kamma,
that human actions bear fruit, and it emphasizes the development of
wisdom. {129}</p>
<p>Besides helping one to prosper in one’s worldly engagements, the
teaching on impermanence prevents one from becoming a slave to the
vicissitudes of life. One can live with change without being battered by
the worldly currents until one is powerless to help oneself, let alone
help others.</p>
<p>People who no longer cling to various aspects of life can clearly see
what is truly valuable. They do not maintain false ideas of what is
beneficial that justify the kinds of gain leading to dependency and
ruin. They take the fullest advantage of prosperity, both material and
spiritual, and are a refuge to others.</p>
<p>On a basic level the understanding of impermanence helps to alleviate
suffering when one is faced with misfortune, and prevents indulgence in
times of success. At an advanced level it leads to a gradual realization
of truth up to an understanding of nonself, resulting in the heart’s
deliverance and the absence of suffering – to perfect mental health.</p>
<p>People tend to use the teaching of impermanence to comfort themselves in
times of anguish or loss, with varying degrees of success. Such use of
impermanence is effective when used appropriately, especially to alert
someone to this truth who has never considered it. Habitual application
of such self-solace is detrimental, however, equivalent to submitting
oneself to worldly tides, or to not taking full advantage of the
teaching on impermanence. Such action is incorrect in the light of the
law of kamma; it contradicts the self-improvement necessary for reaching
the goal of Buddha-Dhamma.</p>
<p>In brief, the advantages of the teaching on impermanence are comprised
of two stages. First, people who comprehend this natural law are able to
diminish or eliminate grief when confronted with undesirable change, and
do not get carried away by desired change. Second, they diligently
attend to necessary tasks, knowing that all alterations are due to
causes; these changes do not occur in isolation or by chance.</p>
<p>Conversely, people who observe that all things are unstable and
transitory and therefore see no point in getting involved, carelessly
letting life drift along, betray a misapprehension and act incorrectly
in relation to impermanence. Such a stance conflicts with the Buddha’s
final teaching:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>All conditioned things are of a nature to decay; strive diligently to
reach the goal.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn92">92</a></sup> {129}</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#dukkha-1" id="dukkha-1">Dukkha</a></h3>
<p>To understand the benefits of the teachings on <em>dukkha</em> one must examine
this characteristic in relation to two key teachings: the Three
Characteristics and the Four Noble Truths:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Given that all conditioned things exist as an aggregate of fleeting
components, and are subject to birth, transmutation, and demise
conforming to the law of impermanence, things are a venue for change
and conflict; they are thoroughly instilled with impending rupture
and decay. To sustain a desired object or to steer the flow of
change in a desired direction requires energy and guidance. The more
complex and numerous the components, the greater the effort and more
meticulous the means required to engage with them. To influence
something one must act at its underlying causes, and know the
relative importance of these causes. Such wise action leads to an
end of suffering. In contrast, action prompted by misguided
attachment leads to oppression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the teaching on the Four Noble Truths, our sole
responsibility (<em>kicca</em>) in the face of <em>dukkha</em> is accurate
knowledge (<em>pariññā</em>). This correct response to suffering is
essential and yet it tends to get overlooked. Buddha-Dhamma teaches
not to increase our suffering but to know suffering, to deal with it
skilfully, and to be free of it: to realize true happiness. In other
words, the teaching on the Four Noble Truths instructs us to
investigate and accurately understand personal problems before
trying to solve them. Investigation of problems does not imply
creating or inflicting ourselves with more; on the contrary, it is a
method for eliminating problems. People who are not aware of the
responsibility enjoined by the noble truths may react to suffering
inappropriately and aimlessly, and may increase their suffering by
viewing the world negatively.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These two dimensions of <em>dukkha</em>, the universal and the personal, and
the skilful response enjoined by the teachings mentioned above determine
the practical value of this characteristic.</p>
<p>The rise and disintegration of things reveals an inherent frailty and
imperfection. Passage of time amplifies this deficiency, as alterations
occur within and surrounding an object. Consequentially, things must
continually struggle to sustain their form or to improve. For human
beings, maintaining a higher quality of life and reaching fulfilment
requires constant revision and refinement. {131}</p>
<p>Our impulsive resistance to the conflicts arising from change generally
leads to more harm than good, irrespective of the matter involved: a
material object, another person, or a community. An appreciation of
proper adaptation and improvement is essential, and points again to the
importance of wisdom, which engages with all things in harmony with
cause and effect.</p>
<p>Ordinary happiness falls within the domain of the characteristic of
<em>dukkha</em>. Such happiness is inherently flawed in the sense that it is
subject to change, and therefore it is not fully satisfying. People who
place their hope in this form of happiness essentially align themselves
with the imperfection, or fall into the stream of change; they are thus
swept in whichever direction the currents go. When disappointed, the
anguish is equal to the expectation for joy. Searching for happiness in
this way is tantamount to enslavement or to gambling with life. It is
incumbent on us to apply mindfulness and clear comprehension while
deriving pleasure from these transient forms of happiness. Despite the
vacillation of worldly joys one should minimize the harmful
repercussions with the resolve: ‘Whatever happens, may I protect freedom
of the heart.’</p>
<p>Happiness is of two kinds: happiness satisfying various forms of desire,
and happiness of a spacious heart – a heart free from mental
obstructions and free from the need for personal gratification.</p>
<p>The first kind of happiness can be subdivided into two kinds: happiness
derived from gratifying unwholesome desire (<em>taṇhā</em>; ‘craving’), and
happiness derived from fulfilling wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>). The first
kind is gratification by way of the five senses, by which one focuses on
deriving pleasure from people or things in a selfish way. The second
kind is a fulfilment of a desire for people or things to be well and
complete. This wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) prompts one to act in order
to help bring about such wellness or completion. It is a vital factor
for nurturing virtue and for spiritual development, leading to more
profound kinds of happiness and acting as a link to the second kind of
happiness (of a spacious heart). This wholesome desire, however, is
often overlooked by people, as if it is concealed or hidden behind the
desire of craving. It will be discussed at more length in another
chapter.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn93">93</a></sup></p>
<p>Here, the discussion is limited to sense pleasure, which the majority of
people get caught up with and obsess over. Sense pleasure is almost an
opposite to the second kind of happiness, which is spacious and
tranquil, free from such obstructions like anxiety and stress, which
bind and oppress the mind. {132}</p>
<p>Pleasure based on sense contact is dependent on external conditions in
order to gratify desire. The disposition of the mind enthralled with
this form of happiness is prevailing agitation, possessiveness, and
self-obsession. When not restrained these selfish qualities cause
problems. It is natural that this form of happiness dependent on
material objects (<em>sāmisa-sukha</em>) leads in some degree to addiction and
disturbance, since it results from an attempt to compensate for a
feeling of lack or loss.</p>
<p>The second kind of happiness is independent of external sense objects;
it is a self-reliant and unconditional state of mind. Its distinguishing
features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Purity</em>: uncontaminated by defilement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Luminosity</em>: accompanied by profound, immeasurable wisdom, prepared
for investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Peace</em>: an absence of anxiety or agitation; relaxed and tranquil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Freedom</em>: free of mental obstruction; spacious, non-attached, and
buoyant; full of lovingkindness, compassion, and appreciative joy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fulfilment</em>: no feelings of inadequacy or loneliness; satisfied;
inherently complete; if compared to the body, akin to having good
health.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two most significant qualities of this state of mind are freedom and
wisdom. Together they manifest in the mind as equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>): an
evenness and balance of mind, which engages with things in an unbiased
way. This profound happiness (<em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>) is of supreme benefit to
human conduct.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn94">94</a></sup> It is untroubled and is instrumental in solving
problems. One can say that it is beyond happiness, and is thus referred
to as freedom from suffering. It signals the end of defect and
insecurity.</p>
<p>Human beings normally seek the first form of happiness, of sense
pleasure (<em>sāmisa-sukha</em>), but they cannot always obtain or keep desired
objects at will because these things are subject to external influences
and are transient. One must therefore try to establish the second kind
of happiness, at least enough to live at ease in the world and to
minimize suffering; one will then know how to relate to sensual
happiness without causing distress for oneself and others. {133}
Understanding the three characteristics engenders this supreme happiness
and leads to non-attachment.</p>
<p>Happiness dependent on external conditions requires the interaction
between two parties, for example between two persons, or a person and an
object. Both parties, however, possess the characteristic of <em>dukkha</em>:
they are impaired by inherent conflict. The friction between two such
entities increases in proportion to the misguided behaviour of the
persons involved.</p>
<p>An example is of two people, one who seeks pleasure and the other who is
the object of desire. Both persons possess inherent deficiency: the
former is not always equipped to partake of pleasure and the latter is
not always in a state to be enjoyed. It is impossible that either always
gains. If they do not realize or accept this fact, they will hold their
gratification as the criterion for happiness, causing strife and
irritation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a person’s fixation on an object includes possessiveness
and a wish to sustain the affiliation forever. This behaviour sets a
person in opposition to the natural causal process. Such lack of wisdom,
applying gratification as the measure for behaviour, is just foolhardy
defiance, leading to the numerous expressions of suffering.</p>
<p>Apart from two parties interacting, additional elements often play a
special participatory role, for example when two people desire the same
object. Frustrated desire tends to create contention, leading to
competition, arguments, and theft, all of which are symptoms of
suffering. The more people attend to their problems with attachment, the
more intense is the ensuing anguish. But the greater the application of
wisdom the less that problems remain.</p>
<p>Ignorance (<em>moha</em>) leads to selfishness and greed (<em>lobha</em>); unable to
acquire a desired object, a person then becomes angry (<em>dosa</em>). Many
other vices spring from these three root defilements, for example
stinginess, jealousy, mistrust, restlessness, anxiety, ill-will, and
laziness, generating ever increasing internal discord. These impurities
divorce people from nature’s harmony. The repercussion of such denial is
a feeling of oppression and stress: nature’s penalty system. Hence, the
<em>dukkha</em> of nature is compounded, creating more intense pain for human
beings, for example: {134}</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Feelings of tension, dullness, embarrassment, agitation, insecurity
and depression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychological disturbances and related physical illnesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ordinary physical pain, for example the pain experienced during
sickness, which is unduly exacerbated because of craving and
clinging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Escalated misery brought about by causing distress and discomfort
for others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased social conflicts resulting from individuals inflaming
their defilements. The consequence is social decline and turmoil.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By engaging with things with ignorance, stubbornly resisting the flow of
nature, and succumbing to desire, the <em>dukkha</em> of formations
(<em>saṅkhāra-dukkha</em>) erupts as pain (<em>dukkha-dukkha</em>).</p>
<p>The alternative is to engage with things wisely based on an accurate
understanding of truth. People with such understanding know that the
dukkha that is an attribute of formations is simply a part of nature;
they do not struggle and create surplus conflict. Knowing that to grasp
these formations would lead to suffering, they abstain from such
grasping. By accepting this truth, they do not breed defilements. They
know how to live in harmony with nature by exercising virtues, which
promote inner spaciousness and peace. Such virtues include:
lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>), compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>), appreciative joy
(<em>muditā</em>), equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>), social concord (<em>sāmaggī</em>),
cooperation, self-sacrifice, self-restraint, patience, humility, and
circumspection.</p>
<p>These virtues counter the many vices, for example: hatred, hostility,
jealousy, dissension, greed, self-indulgence, obstinacy, arrogance,
fear, mistrust, indolence, infatuation, absentmindedness, and credulity.</p>
<p>This harmonious and wise way of conducting our lives, of taking best
advantage of nature’s laws, not forfeiting our freedom, and not clinging
is the most excellent way to live, as extolled by the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Life with wisdom is the supreme life. {135}</p>
<p><em>Paññājīviṃ jīvitamāhu seṭṭhaṃ.</em></p>
<p><em>Sn. 32.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3><a class="header" href="#anattā" id="anattā">Anattā</a></h3>
<p>An understanding of nonself benefits conduct in these significant ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It reduces selfishness and prevents one from applying personal gain
as a basis for action. Instead, not limited by a sense of self, one
discerns the wider benefit of one’s actions.</p>
<p>According to the selfless nature of things, an object is dependent
on its causes, which steer and shape the course the object takes.
For this reason this teaching emphasizes that a person should wisely
relate to things in conformity with their causes and conditions,
which is the most effective way to succeed in one’s aspirations and
to avoid suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerning ‘view’ (<em>diṭṭhi</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn95">95</a></sup> this understanding broadens the
mind, enabling it to manage problems without the interference from
selfish desires and attachments. Instead, the mind engages with an
object in accord with its true nature and potential. The mind is
equanimous, and complies with the sovereignty of truth
(<em>dhammādhipateyya</em>), rather than pursuing sovereignty of self
(<em>attādhipateyya</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a higher level, an understanding of selflessness is equivalent to
knowing all things as they truly are; it is an ultimate
understanding of truth. Such complete understanding brings about the
utter removal of clinging and the realization of perfect freedom,
which is the goal of Buddha-Dhamma. A lucid understanding of
nonself, however, relies on an understanding of Dependent
Origination, and on a practice consistent with the Eightfold Path,
as will be discussed later.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn96">96</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The teaching on the Three Characteristics verifies other Buddhist
teachings, in particular the teachings on kamma and the path to
deliverance. For example, because all things are void of a fixed
self, an interconnected causal dynamic is possible, and therefore
our actions can bear fruit. And because the self is not fixed,
liberation is possible. These statements, however, must be viewed in
the context of Dependent Origination, which is explained in the
following chapter. {136}</p>

<p>When there is form ... feeling ... perception ... volitional
formations ... consciousness, owing to form ... consciousness, by
adhering to form ... consciousness, such a view as this arises: ‘This

<p><em>S. III. 203-204.</em></p>
<p>Monks, whichever ascetics and brahmans who regard the self in various,
manifold ways all regard [as self] the five aggregates subject to
clinging, or a certain one among them. What five?</p>
<p>Here, the uninstructed worldling ... regards form as self, or self as
possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. He regards
feeling ... perception ... volitional formations ... consciousness as

<p><em>S. III. 46.</em></p>
<p>Monks, physical form is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is
dukkha; whatever is dukkha is nonself. Whatever is nonself should be
seen as it truly is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, I am
not this, this is not my self.’ (The same for feeling, perception,
volitional formations, and consciousness.)</p>
<p><em>E.g.: S. III. 22.</em></p>
<p>Monks, physical form is impermanent ... oppressive (<em>dukkha</em>) ... and
nonself. So too, the causes for the arising of physical form are

perception as self ... volitional formations as self ... consciousness
as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in
self, or self as in consciousness.</p>
<p>He understands as it truly is impermanent form as ‘impermanent form’
... impermanent consciousness as ‘impermanent consciousness’. He
understands as it truly is stressful (<em>dukkha</em>) form as ‘stressful

<p>How, monks, is there non-agitation through non-clinging? Here, an
instructed noble disciple ... does not regard physical form as self,
self as possessing form, self in form, or form in self. That form of
his changes and alters. Despite the change and alteration of form, his
consciousness is not preoccupied with this physical change. No
agitation and constellation of mental states (<em>dhamma-samuppāda</em>)
arising from preoccupation with physical change remains overpowering
his mind. {138}</p>
<p>Because his mind is not overpowered, he is not frightened, distressed
or anxious, and through non-clinging he does not become agitated. (The
same for feeling, perception, volitional formations, and

<p>Monks, when one has understood the impermanence, alteration, fading
away and cessation of physical form, and when one sees as it truly is
with correct wisdom thus: ‘Form, both past and present, is
impermanent, dukkha and subject to change,’ then one abandons sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief and despair. By abandoning sorrow ...
despair, one is not agitated. Unagitated one dwells happily. A monk
who dwells happily is said to be quenched in that respect
(<em>tadaṅga-nibbuta</em>). (The same for feeling, perception, volitional
formations, and consciousness.)</p>
<p><em>S. III. 43.</em></p>
<p>An untaught ordinary person reflects unwisely (<em>ayoniso-manasikāra</em>)
thus: ‘In the far-reaching past did I exist? Did I not exist? What was
I? How was I? Having been what, what did I become? In the far-reaching
future will I exist? Will I not exist? What will I be? How will I be?
Having been what, what will I become?’ Or else he doubts about the
present thus: ‘Do I exist or do I not exist? What am I? How am I?
Where has this being come from? Where will it go?’</p>
<p>When he reflects unwisely in this way, one of the six views arises in
him. There arises the view (belief) as true and real: ‘I have a self’,
‘I do not have a self’, ‘I perceive the self by way of the self’, ‘I
perceive nonself by way of the self’, ‘I perceive the self by way of
nonself’. Or else he has some such view as this: ‘It is this self of
mine that directs, feels and experiences here and there the fruits of
good and bad actions; it is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to
change, and it will endure like this forever.’ Monks, this speculative
view is called the thicket of views, the wilderness of views, the
disturbance of views, the wriggling of views, the fetter of views.
Fettered by the fetter of views, the untaught ordinary person is not
freed from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief and despair; he is not freed from suffering, I say.</p>
<p>Monks, a well-taught noble disciple ... understands what things are
fit for reflection and what things are unfit for reflection. He does
not reflect on those things unfit for reflection, and he reflects on
those things fit for reflection.</p>
<p>What are the things unfit for reflection that he does not reflect on?
They are the things such that when he reflects on them, the unarisen
taints of sensual lust, becoming, and ignorance arise in him, and
arisen taints increase. These are the things unfit for reflection that
a noble disciple does not reflect on.</p>
<p>And what are the things fit for reflection that a noble disciple
reflects on? They are the things such that when he reflects on them,
the unarisen taints of sensual lust, becoming, and ignorance do not
arise, and arisen taints are abandoned. These are the things fit for
reflection that he reflects on. {139}</p>
<p>By not reflecting on things unfit for reflection and by reflecting on
things fit for reflection, unarisen taints do not arise in him and
arisen taints are abandoned.</p>
<p>That noble disciple reflects wisely (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) thus: ‘This
is suffering ... this is the cause of suffering ... this is the
cessation of suffering ... this is the way to the cessation of
suffering.’ When he reflects wisely in this way, three fetters are
abandoned in him: personality-view (<em>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</em>), doubt
(<em>vicikicchā</em>), and adherence to rules and observances
(<em>sīlabbataparāmāsa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn99">99</a></sup></p>

<p>Monks, this lifespan of human beings is short; one must pass on to the
future life. You should reflect wisely, do good, and live a pure life
(<em>brahmacariya</em>). One born cannot avoid death; one who lives long
lives a hundred years or a fraction more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Short is the life span of human beings,<br />
The good man should disdain it.<br />
You should live like one with head aflame:<br />
No one can avoid Death’s arrival.</em></p>
<p>Days and nights pass by;<br />
Life is brought to a halt.<br />
The life of mortals is exhausted<br />
Like the water of small streams.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn104">104</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life in this world is unpredictable and uncertain. Life here is
difficult, short, and bound up with suffering. There are no means to
help those born to avoid death. Even for one reaching old age, death
prevails; such is the nature of living creatures. {140}</p>
<p>As ripe fruit is in constant danger of falling, so too living beings
are in constant danger of death. As clay pots made by the potter end
up shattered, so it is with the life of mortals. The young and the
old, the foolish and the wise, all are trapped by death, all have
death as their end.</p>
<p>When they are overcome by death, going from here to the next world,
even a father cannot save his son, or a family its relatives. Look:
while relatives are watching, tearful and wailing, humans are carried
off one by one, like cattle being led to slaughter. The world is
smitten by death and old age.</p>
<p>The wise do not grieve, knowing the nature of the world. You cannot
know a person’s path, neither its origin nor its destination. Not
seeing these ends, to grieve for him is futile. If a deluded person
should gain any good by lament and self-torment, a wise person would
act so too. Grief does not lead to peace of mind. On the contrary, it
doubles the misery and harm.</p>
<p>Tormenting himself, a mourner grows thin and pale. He cannot thereby
aid the departed; lamentation is of no avail. Without abandoning grief
a person suffers further anguish. Mourning the departed makes him a
slave to sorrow.</p>
<p>Look at people set to depart in conformity with their actions; all
beings are terrified when trapped by Death. What people expect is
always different from what actually happens; such is the nature of
separation.</p>
<p>See the way of the world: a person may live for a hundred years or
more, but in the end he is parted from his relatives, and he too
forsakes life here.</p>
<p>Having listened to the worthy ones, dispel your grief. Seeing someone
who has passed away say: ‘I cannot bring him back again.’ A wise,
skilled and learned person eliminates sorrow as soon as it arises,
like dousing a fire, or like the wind blowing away a tuft of cotton.</p>
<p>A person wishing for happiness should allay bereavement, pining, and
distress; he should pull out this piercing arrow. Having pulled out
the arrow he is free and discovers peace of mind. He passes beyond all
grief, sorrowless and quenched.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn105">105</a></sup> {141}</p>
<p><em>Sn. 112-114</em></p>
<p>Once conceived in the womb at day or night, human beings go onwards
without return. Despite abundant vigour, their battles against aging
and death are futile. Aging and death overrun all beings; for this
reason I resolve to practise the Dhamma.</p>
<p>Kings may defeat a fearsome fourfold army [of elephants, horses,
chariots and infantry], but they are unable to defeat the Lord of
Death.... Surrounded by a fourfold army, kings may escape an enemy’s
clutches, but they are unable to escape from Death.... With elephants,
horses, chariots, and infantry a hero may assail and destroy an enemy,
but he is unable to destroy Death.... People can propitiate furious
demons, spirits and ghosts, but they are unable to placate Death.... A
criminal, felon or rogue may still receive the king’s clemency, but
Death shows no mercy.... Not royalty or nobility, not the rich, the
powerful or the strong; Death pities no one. For this reason I resolve
to practise the Dhamma....</p>
<p>Indeed righteousness protects the righteous; Truth when well-observed
brings the reward of joy. Those who observe the Truth to a woeful
state do not go. For righteousness and unrighteousness have not equal
ends; unrighteousness leads to hell; righteousness leads to a happy
abode.</p>

<p>Do not let the days pass in vain – accomplish something, great or

death. I see your young daughters, maidens lovely to behold; but their
life ends like an uprooted tender bamboo.</p>
<p>Truly both men and women though of youthful age can die; who is
assured of life, saying, ‘I am still young?’ The days and nights pass
by; life’s duration constantly shrinks, like the time remaining for a
school of fish in an evaporating pond. What reassurance is youth?</p>
<p>The world is smitten by Death and besieged by old age; the days do not
pass in vain.... Just as thread is used up by weavers, so too is the
life of human beings. Just as a brimming river does not return to the
heights, so too human beings do not return to youth. Just as a swollen
river sweeps away the trees along its banks, so too old age and death
sweep away all living beings.... Just as ripe fruit is in constant
danger of falling, so too living beings are in constant danger of
death.</p>
<p>In the morning we see many people; by evening some are no longer in

<p>Monks, there are these five states not obtainable by ascetic, brahman,
god, Māra or Brahma, nor by anyone in the world. What five? The
fulfilment of these requests: ‘May what is subject to aging not age’,
‘may what is subject to sickness not sicken’, ‘may the mortal not
die’, ‘may the transient not end’, and ‘may the unstable not be
destroyed’.</p>
<p>For an untaught ordinary person, something subject to aging ages,
something subject to sickness sickens, something mortal dies,
something transient ends, and something unstable is destroyed. [When
this happens] that ordinary person ... does not reflect thus: ‘Not to
me only ... [does this happen], but as long as beings come and go,
arise and pass away, to all, that which is subject to aging ages ...
that which is unstable is destroyed. When that which is subject to
aging ages ... that which is unstable is destroyed, if I grieve, pine,
lament, beat my breast, wail and anguish, food would have no appeal,
the body would languish, affairs would be neglected, enemies would
rejoice, while friends would be distraught’.... [When those
conditions come about] he grieves, pines, laments and wails. This
person is called an untaught ordinary person; pierced by the poisoned
dart of sorrow, he torments himself.</p>
<p>To the learned, noble disciple also, that which is prone to aging ages
... that which is unstable is destroyed. {144} [When this happens]
that noble disciple ... reflects thus: ‘Not to me only ... [does this
happen], but as long as beings come and go, arise and pass away, to

grieve, pine, lament or wail. This person is called a learned, noble
disciple; drawn out is the poisoned dart of sorrow with which the
untaught ordinary person torments himself. This noble disciple, having
extinguished the fires of anguish, is sorrowless, dart-free and
quenched.</p>

diligent in teaching the Dhamma in detail to their disciples, and they
had many discourses in prose, in prose and verse ... and catechetical
discourses. They prescribed the training rules for their disciples,
and laid down the Pāṭimokkha.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn114">114</a></sup> When these Buddhas, these Blessed
Ones, and their awakened disciples passed away, disciples of later
generations of various names, families and clans went forth and
preserved the teaching for a very long time.</p>
<p>It is as if various flowers, loose on a plank of wood, well tied
together by a thread, are not scattered and dispersed by a gust of
wind. This is because they are well tied together by the thread.... It

<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Since designations (<em>paññatti</em>), for example the label ‘person’, are
conventional truths – they are contrived and ultimately do not exist
– they are not characterized by impermanence and <em>dukkha</em>, as such
characteristics imply rise and decay. They should, however, be
characterized as nonself, because they are void of any substance that
exists, for example as agent or recipient. Therefore, designations are
explained as nonself, along with Nibbāna, which does exist, because
they are both unconditioned (<em>asaṅkhata</em>) ... they do not arise from
conditioning factors. Nibbāna is unconditioned and does exist;
designations are unconditioned and do not ultimately exist. Hence,
there exists the one, true Unconditioned – Nibbāna – but both
Nibbāna and designations are selfless.</p>

are as follows:</p>

<p><em>Sabhāva-dukkha</em>: <em>dukkha</em> inherent in conditioned phenomena, i.e.
birth, aging and death;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pakiṇṇaka-dukkha</em> or <em>dukkha-cara</em>: sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief and despair (including association with the disagreeable,
separation from the loved, and the non-acquisition of the desired);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nibaddha-dukkha</em>: continual or resident suffering, i.e. cold, heat,
hunger, thirst, and the need to defecate and urinate;</p>

<li>
<p><em>Byādhi-dukkha</em> (illness) or <em>dukkha-vedanā</em> (pain);</p>

<li>
<p><em>Santāpa-dukkha</em>: the burning and agitation of the heart due to the
‘fires’ of defilement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vipāka-dukkha</em>: the afflictive fruits of actions, i.e. remorse,
punishment, and the fall into states of perdition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sahagata-dukkha</em>: concomitant suffering; the suffering accompanying
mundane, agreeable conditions, e.g. the suffering of needing to
protect material possessions;</p>
</li>

<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-4-god" id="appendix-4-god">Appendix 4: God</a></h2>
<p>The meanings of the words <em>Phra Jao</em> (Thai for ‘God’, literally
‘Excellent Lord’) and the English ‘God’ are vague. <em>Phra Jao</em> was
originally a word used by Buddhists as an epithet for the Buddha (<em>Phra
Phu Pen Jao</em> – ‘Venerable Lord’ – is still a form of address to
monks).</p>
<p>Once Christians adopted this term to refer to their God, Buddhists
abandoned it until they forgot the original meaning. As for the word
‘God’, Christians use this term to denote the Supreme Divinity, who they
believe created the world and is characterized as a Being.</p>
<p>Some philosophers, however, broaden the meaning of God to be an abstract
quality, not necessarily involved with the world’s creation. Some
contemporary Christian theologians define God in a similar way, i.e. not
as a Being, but Christian establishments reject these definitions (or
outright condemn them).</p>
<p>When Hans Küng (in ‘Does God Exist? An Answer for Today’, trans. Edward
Quinn. London: Collins, 1980, pp. 594-602) tried to compare God with
Nibbāna, he realized the difference, as Nibbāna is not involved in the
creation of the world.</p>

The most common translations include: suffering, unsatisfactoriness,
stress, pain, and misery. Many misunderstandings have arisen by
translating the second characteristic as: ‘everything is suffering’
or ‘life is suffering’. For the different contexts in which the term
<em>dukkha</em> is used, see below. Please note that when I use the terms
‘stressful’ and ‘under stress’ in this context I am referring to the

section, <em>does not regard physical form as self, or self as
possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form</em>, is
encapsulated in the Visuddhimagga’s definition: <em>Na attā</em> (not
self), <em>na attano</em> (not of self), <em>na attani</em> (not in self), <em>na
attavatī</em> (not possessing self); see Vism. 578. The Visuddhimagga
uses numerous explanations for perceiving selflessness, for example
by regarding physical form as not a being, a spirit, a person, a
youth, a woman, a man, a self or of self, us or ours, or belonging
to anyone (Vism. 653-6).</p>

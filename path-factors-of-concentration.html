</div>
<h2><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The Buddha classified the eight Path factors (the Noble Eightfold Path)
into three groups or ‘aggregates’ (<em>khandha</em>), namely: the morality
group (<em>sīla-khandha</em>), the concentration group (<em>samādhi-khandha</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
and the wisdom group (<em>paññā-khandha</em>), or simply: virtuous conduct
(<em>sīla</em>), concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). Here, right
effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration are included in the
concentration group.</p>
<p>As a group, these three factors are also referred to as ‘training in
higher mind’ (<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>), which can be defined as: training the
mind, cultivating spiritual qualities, generating happiness, developing
the state of one’s mind, and gaining proficiency at concentration. The
essence of training in higher mind is to develop and enhance the quality
and potential of the mind, which supports living a virtuous life and is
conducive to applying wisdom in the optimal way.</p>
<p>On the highest level, ‘higher mind’ (<em>adhicitta</em>) or concentration
refers to methods of developing tranquillity (<em>samatha</em>) and to various
methods of tranquillity meditation. But in a general, comprehensive
sense, higher mind or concentration encompasses all the methods and
means to induce calm in people’s minds, to make people be steadfast in
virtue, to rouse enthusiasm, and to generate perseverance in developing
goodness.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#right-effort" id="right-effort">Right Effort</a></h2>
<p>Right effort (<em>sammā-vāyāma</em>) is the sixth factor of the Eightfold Path.
The suttas define right effort as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, what is right effort? Here, a monk in this Dhamma and
Discipline:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generates wholesome enthusiasm, exerts effort, rouses energy,
strives, and determines to prevent unarisen evil, unwholesome
qualities from arising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generates wholesome enthusiasm, exerts effort, rouses energy,
strives, and determines to abandon arisen evil, unwholesome
qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generates wholesome enthusiasm, exerts effort, rouses energy,
strives, and determines to foster unarisen wholesome qualities to
come into being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generates wholesome enthusiasm, exerts effort, rouses energy,
strives, and determines for the continuance, non-disappearance,
increase, completion, thriving, and fulfilment of arisen wholesome
qualities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>D. II. 311; M. I. 62; M. III. 251-2; Vbh. 105, 235.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Abhidhamma offers an additional definition:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>What is right effort? The rousing of energy (viriyārambha) in the
mind; progress, perseverance, determination, effort, exertion,
persistence, steadfastness, constancy; steady progress, not forsaking
enthusiasm, not neglecting work, shouldering responsibility; energy,
the faculty of energy, the power of energy, balanced effort; the
enlightenment factor of energy, which is a factor of the Path,
connected to the Path. This is called right effort.</p>
<p><em>Vbh. 107, 237.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In these definitions note the importance of wholesome enthusiasm
(<em>chanda</em>; ‘wholesome desire’), which is the forerunner of right effort
and is the essence of all forms of honourable perseverance. {755}</p>
<p>The definition in the suttas above, in which right effort is divided
into four factors, is also called ‘right endeavour’
(<em>sammappadhāna</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> or the four endeavours (<em>padhāna</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> and each
of these four endeavours has a specific name, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Saṁvara-padhāna</em>: the endeavour to prevent or to be on guard
against (unarisen unwholesome qualities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pahāna-padhāna</em>: the endeavour to abandon or to eliminate (arisen
unwholesome qualities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhāvanā-padhāna</em>: the endeavour to cultivate or to develop
(unarisen wholesome qualities).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anurakkhanā-padhāna</em>: the endeavour to protect, safeguard, or
increase (arisen wholesome qualities).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These four efforts are sometimes explained by presenting examples:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Saṁvara-padhāna</em>: when a monk sees a material form with the eye, he
does not grasp at its signs and features (he is not captivated by
its dominant and minor attributes). He practises in order to
restrain the sense faculties, which when unrestrained are the cause
for the unwholesome mind states of covetousness and aversion to
overwhelm the mind. He protects the eye faculty, he is restrained in
regard to the eye faculty (the same for hearing sounds, smelling
odours, savouring tastes, contacting tactile objects by way of the
body, and cognizing mental objects by way of the mind).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pahāna-padhāna</em>: a monk does not permit thoughts of sensuality,
thoughts of ill-will, thoughts of cruelty, and evil, unwholesome
states that have arisen to be sustained; he abandons them, decreases
them, brings them to destruction, makes them without remainder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhāvanā-padhāna</em>: a monk develops the seven factors of
enlightenment, which rely on seclusion, dispassion, and cessation,
and incline towards liberation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anurakkhanā-padhāna</em>: a monk nurtures the ‘concentrative signs’
(<em>samādhi-nimitta</em>), that is, the six ‘perceptions’ (<em>saññā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Effort is a vital quality in Buddhism, which is evident from the fact
that right effort is one of three factors (along with right view and
right mindfulness) which is required as a constant support for the other
factors of the Eightfold Path.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> In almost every group of spiritual
factors found in the scriptures effort is included, represented by
different Pali terms.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> The following passages by the Buddha confirm
the importance of effort:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>This Dhamma is for the energetic, not for the indolent.</p>
<p><em>A. IV. 233.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, I know clearly the value of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To not be content with wholesome states of mind so far achieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be unremitting in putting forth effort.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, you should practise accordingly: ‘May I put forth
unremitting effort. Let only my skin, sinews and bones remain; let the
flesh in my body dry up; yet there shall be no ceasing of energy till
I have attained whatever can be won by manly strength, manly energy,
manly effort.’ Thus should you train yourselves. {756}</p>
<p><em>A. I. 50.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Among other reasons, the repeated emphasis on effort stems from the
primary Buddhist principle that the truth is an aspect of nature or
exists as laws of nature. The role of the Buddha (the ‘Teacher’ –
<em>satthā</em>) is to discover this truth and then reveal it to others. The
fruits of spiritual practice occur in an impartial way according to
natural causes and conditions; they are not generated by the Teacher.
Therefore, people must make effort and produce results by their own
strength and energy; they should not expect or appeal for desired
results without putting forth effort, as is confirmed by this verse in
the Dhammapada:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The Awakened Ones can but point the way;<br />
You must make the effort yourselves.</p>
<p><em>Tumhehi kiccaṃ ātappaṃ akkhātāro tathāgatā.</em></p>
<p><em>Dh. verse 276.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Putting forth effort is similar to developing other spiritual qualities;
all these qualities must be cultivated in an integrated manner, not in
isolation. When effort has been properly prepared and integrated in the
mind, one is then ready to express it as concrete actions in the
external world. It is not a matter of simply generating a wish to make
effort and then wilfully applying physical force in one’s exertions,
which may lead to excessive straining and have very harmful
consequences.</p>
<p>The making of effort must thus be in harmony with other spiritual
qualities, most notably mindfulness and clear comprehension. One acts
with understanding and awareness. One makes a balanced effort, by being
neither too tight nor too slack, as is described in this story from the
suttas:</p>
<p>At one time Ven. Soṇa was residing in the Sītavana grove near Rājagaha.
He put forth extreme effort in his practice, doing walking meditation
(<em>caṅkamana</em>) until the soles of both his feet were blistered and
bleeding, but without success. He thus had this thought:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>I am one of the most energetic disciples of the Blessed One, yet my
mind has not attained liberation from the taints nor is it free from
clinging. Now my family is wealthy, and I can utilize my wealth and do
meritorious deeds. Let me then give up the training, and utilize my
wealth and do meritorious deeds.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha knew what Soṇa was thinking and came to speak with him:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>‘Soṇa, weren’t you just now thinking of giving up the training...?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, Lord.’</p>

<p>Although right effort as one of the Path factors is an internal quality,
for it to be effective and to be developed, it must rely on an
interaction with the outside world. This includes how one responds to
various sense impressions, and generally how one behaves, lives one’s
life, and engages in various activities. It also includes how one’s
environment affects one’s effort and the cultivation of related
spiritual factors, in both favourable and adverse ways.</p>
<p>The effort (referred to as <em>padhāna</em> – ‘endeavour’) made in Dhamma
practice, which manifests as external action and is given systematic
form, is connected to and dependent on particular environmental factors
like the physical body, natural surroundings, and society. The Buddhist
teachings thus emphasize the importance of external environmental
factors for fostering a virtuous life and realizing the highest goal of
Buddhism:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these five attributes of one who puts forth effort
(<em>padhāniyaṅga</em>). What five? Here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A monk has faith, he has confidence in the Tathāgata’s awakening
thus: ‘For these reasons, the Blessed One is accomplished, fully
enlightened ... is one who elucidates and disseminates the
Dhamma.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is not encumbered by illness and affliction; he possesses a
balanced metabolism for digesting food that is neither too cool
nor too warm, but medium and suitable for striving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is not boastful or deceptive; he shows himself as he actually
is to the Teacher and to his discreet companions in the holy life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is energetic in abandoning unwholesome states and in fulfilling
wholesome states, steadfast, persevering, constant, not neglectful
in cultivating wholesome states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is wise; he possesses wisdom regarding rise and dissolution
that is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete
destruction of suffering. {758}</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#definition" id="definition">Definition</a></h3>
<p>Right mindfulness (<em>sammā-sati</em>) is the second factor in the group
classified as <em>samādhi</em> or as ‘training in higher mind’
(<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> The suttas define right mindfulness as
follows:</p>
<p>Monks, what is right mindfulness? This is called right mindfulness: a

<li>
<p>Discerns the body in the body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful,
free from covetousness and grief for the world.</p>

<p>The Abhidhamma provides another definition:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>What is right mindfulness? Mindfulness is constant recollection and
reflection; [or] mindfulness is the state of recollection,
remembering, non-fading, non-forgetting. Mindfulness is the faculty of
mindfulness, the power of mindfulness, balanced awareness, the
enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is a factor of the Path,
connected to the Path. This is called right mindfulness.</p>
<p><em>Vbh. 107, 237.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The sutta definition of right mindfulness above is part of the teaching
on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. Each of the four factors in this
teaching has an abbreviated name:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Kāyānupassanā</em> (contemplation of the body; observing the nature of
the body).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vedanānupassanā</em> (contemplation of feelings; observing the nature
of feelings).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cittānupassanā</em> (contemplation of mind; observing the nature of
mind).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dhammānupassanā</em> (contemplation of mind objects; observing the
nature of mind objects). (See
Note <a href="#note-dhammanupassana">Meaning of Dhammānupassanā</a>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Meaning of Dhammānupassanā</span><a id="note-dhammanupassana"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trans.: there appears to be a fair deal of confusion among Buddhists
as to the meaning of <em>dhammānupassanā</em>. (Translations of this term
range from: ‘contemplation of mind objects’, ‘contemplation of the
nature of things’, ‘contemplation of phenomena’, ‘contemplation of
true nature’, and ‘contemplation of psychological qualities’.) I
therefore went to visit the venerable author to try and clarify some
doubts over this matter. Ven. Phra Payutto’s response in a nutshell
was as follows:</p>
<p>Basically, the term <em>dhammānupassanā</em> does refer to ‘mind objects’ –
to thoughts and reflections. The reason why the Buddha chose examples
of the formal teachings (e.g. the seven factors of enlightenment, the
five hindrances, etc.) is because these particular kinds of
reflections are conducive to awakening. The fourth <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> is
linked with the third: for example, one may have insight into the fact
that the mind is subject to greed (<em>cittānupassanā</em>) and then
contemplate the nature of greed, say as a manifestation of one of the
hindrances.</p>
<p>The reason why the four mental aggregates (<em>khandha</em>) do not comprise
one of the foundations of mindfulness is because these aggregates are
in a sense more abstract: they are more difficult to ‘capture’ in
awareness. The four <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> are more practical – they are more
easily observable and deal with everyday phenomena.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Before examining right mindfulness within the context of the Four
Foundations of Mindfulness, it is important to gain a basic
understanding of this term <em>sati</em> (’mindfulness’).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#mindfulness-as-heedfulness" id="mindfulness-as-heedfulness">Mindfulness as Heedfulness</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(English translations for <em>sati</em> include: mindfulness,
attentiveness, and detached watching. Translations for <em>appamāda</em>
include: heedfulness, watchfulness, earnestness, diligence, zeal,
carefulness, non-neglect of mindfulness, and non-negligence.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Sati</em> is most simply rendered as ‘recollection’, but such a translation
may convey the idea that it is simply an aspect of memory. While memory
is certainly a valid element of <em>sati’s</em> function, it does not do full
justice to the essential meaning of the term. As a negation, apart from
its meaning of ‘non-forgetting’, <em>sati</em> also refers to
‘non-carelessness’, ‘non-negligence’, ‘non-distraction’, and
‘non-confusion’. The mind is neither disorientated nor inattentive;
rather it is focused and alert. These negations point to the positive
qualities of circumspection, discernment of one’s responsibilities,
attentiveness to one’s actions, and a readiness to receive things
combined with an awareness of how to engage with them, giving rise to
vigilance and care.</p>
<p>The function of mindfulness is often compared to that of a gatekeeper,
who pays constant attention to those people who enter and leave a city
gate, permitting those suitable persons to enter and leave, while
forbidding those who are unsuitable. Mindfulness is thus of major
importance in the field of ethics. It regulates people’s actions, and it
helps to protect and restrain, by keeping people from indulging in bad
actions and by preventing unwholesomeness from infiltrating the mind.
Put in simple terms, mindfulness reminds us to do good and to give no
ground to the bad.</p>
<p>The Buddhist teachings give great importance to mindfulness at every
level of ethical conduct. Conducting one’s life or one’s Dhamma practice
constantly governed by mindfulness is called <em>appamāda</em>, or heedfulness.
Heedfulness is of central importance to progress in a system of ethics,
and is usually defined as ‘living with uninterrupted awareness’. {760}
This may be expanded on as implying: constant care and circumspection,
not allowing oneself to stumble into harmful ways; not missing any
opportunity for betterment; a clear awareness of what things need to be
done and what left undone; non-negligence; and performing one’s daily
tasks with sincerity and with unbending effort towards improvement. It
may be said that <em>appamāda</em> is the Buddhist sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Heedfulness is classified as an ‘internal factor’, as is wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>). Both of these factors may form a pair with an
identical external counterpart: association with good and noble friends
(<em>kalyāṇa-mittatā</em>). The Buddha’s words describing heedfulness sometimes
overlap his descriptions of wise reflection, for these two qualities are
of equal importance, though they differ in application.</p>
<p>Wise reflection is a wisdom factor and is a tool for practical
application. Heedfulness, on the other hand, is a concentration factor;
it is that which governs the use of wise reflection, urges its
employment, and constantly inspires one to further progress.</p>
<p>The importance and scope of heedfulness at various levels of ethical
conduct may be seen from the Buddha’s own words in the following
examples:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, just as the footprints of all land animals fit into the
footprint of the elephant, and the elephant’s footprint is declared to
be the chief among them, that is, with respect to size, so too
whatever wholesome states there are, they are all rooted in diligence,
converge upon diligence, and diligence is declared to be the chief
among them.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 43; A. V. 21-22.</em></p>
<p>No other thing do I see which is so responsible for causing unarisen
wholesome states to arise and arisen unwholesome states to wane as
diligence. In one who is diligent, wholesome states not yet arisen
will arise and unwholesome states that have arisen will wane.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 11.</em></p>
<p>No other thing do I see which is so helpful for great benefit as
diligence....</p>
<p><em>A. I. 16.</em></p>
<p>No other thing do I see which is so helpful for the stability, the
non-vanishing, the non-disappearance of the True Dhamma as diligence.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 16-17.</em></p>
<p>As to internal factors, I do not see any other factor that is so
helpful for great benefit as diligence.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 17-18.</em></p>
<p>Just as the dawn is the forerunner and precursor of the rising of the
sun, so too, accomplishment in diligence is the forerunner and
precursor for the arising of the Noble Eightfold Path for a
bhikkhu.... {761} The chief quality for greatly assisting the arising
of the Noble Eightfold Path is accomplishment in diligence.... I see
no other thing by means of which the unarisen Noble Eightfold Path
arises and the arisen Noble Eightfold Path prospers and is fulfilled
as the accomplishment of diligence.... When a bhikkhu is diligent it
is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate this Noble
Eightfold Path.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 30, 32-3, 35-7, 41-45.</em></p>
<p>In regard to four matters, O monks, should diligence be cultivated.
What four?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You should abandon immoral physical conduct, cultivate virtuous
physical conduct, and not be negligent in this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should abandon immoral verbal conduct, cultivate virtuous
verbal conduct, and not be negligent in this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should abandon immoral mental conduct, cultivate virtuous
mental conduct, and not be negligent in this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should abandon wrong view, cultivate right view, and not be
negligent in this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If a monk has abandoned immoral physical conduct, cultivated virtuous
physical conduct ... abandoned wrong view, and cultivated right view,
he does not fear advancing death.</p>
<p><em>A. II. 119-20.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>In four ways, O monks, should a monk cultivate diligence by himself,
guarding the mind with mindfulness:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>‘May my mind not harbour lust for anything inducing lust....’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘May my mind not harbour anger for anything inducing anger....’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘May my mind not be deluded by anything inducing delusion....’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘May my mind not be infatuated by anything inducing
infatuation....’</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When a monk’s mind does not harbour lust for lust-inducing objects,
because he is free from lust, when his mind does not harbour anger ...
when he is not deluded ... when he is not infatuated, then he will not
waver, shake, recoil, or tremble with fear, and he will not [need
to] believe anyone, not even the words of ascetics.</p>
<p><em>A. II. 120.</em></p>
<p><em>King Pasenadi:</em> Is there, venerable sir, one thing which secures both
kinds of good, the good pertaining to the present (or the visible
good) and that pertaining to the future (or the spiritual,
inconspicuous good)?</p>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> There is.</p>
<p><em>King Pasenadi:</em> And what is that one thing?</p>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> Diligence, great king.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 86; A. III. 364.</em></p>
<p>So it is, great king! The Dhamma which has been well expounded by me
is for one with good friends, good companions, good comrades, not for
one with bad friends, bad companions, bad comrades.... Indeed, good
friendship is equal to the whole of the holy life.</p>
<p>Therefore, great king, you should train yourself thus: ‘I will have
good friends, good companions, good comrades to associate with.’ When,
great king, you have good friends, good companions, good comrades, you
should dwell with one thing for support: diligence in wholesome
states. {762}</p>
<p>When, great king, you are dwelling diligently, with diligence for
support, your ladies of the court ... retinue of nobles ... soldiers
... subjects in town and countryside will think thus: ‘The king dwells
diligently, with diligence for support. Come now, let us also dwell
diligently, with diligence for support.’</p>
<p>When, great king, you are dwelling diligently, with diligence for
support, you yourself will be guarded and protected, your retinue of
royal ladies will be guarded and protected, [even] your treasury and
storehouses will be guarded and protected.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 87-9.</em></p>

<p>Even the Buddha’s last words which he uttered before his final passing
away (<em>parinibbāna</em>) pertain to heedfulness:</p>

<p>All conditioned things are of a nature to decay; strive to attain the
goal by diligence.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#social-value-of-mindfulness" id="social-value-of-mindfulness">Social Value of Mindfulness</a></h3>
<p>In the following quotation from the Sedaka Sutta, the Buddha’s words
describing the benefits of mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) reveal the closeness, in
practical terms, of its meaning to that of heedfulness (<em>appamāda</em>).
Besides clarifying the meaning of these two qualities, this sutta also
reveals the Buddhist attitude towards a person’s relationship to
society. The Buddhist teachings view the internal life of an individual
as intimately connected to the external world – to society. These two
aspects of a person’s life are inseparable:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, once in the past an acrobat set up his bamboo pole and
addressed his apprentice thus: ‘Come, climb the bamboo pole and stand
on my shoulders.’ Having consented to this request, the apprentice
climbed up the bamboo pole and stood on the teacher’s shoulders.</p>
<p>Then the acrobat said to the apprentice: ‘You protect me and I’ll
protect you. Thus guarded by one another, protected by one another,
we’ll display our skills, collect our fee, and get down safely from
the bamboo pole.’</p>
<p>When this was said, the apprentice replied: ‘That’s not the way to do
it, sir. You protect yourself, teacher, and I’ll protect myself. Thus,
each self-guarded and self-protected, we’ll display our skills,
collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’</p>
<p>That is the correct method in that case. It is just as the apprentice
said to the teacher. When thinking, ‘I will protect myself’, one must
apply the foundations of mindfulness; [so too], when thinking, ‘I
will protect others’, one must apply the foundations of mindfulness.
Protecting oneself, monks, one protects others; protecting others, one
protects oneself.</p>
<p>And how is it that by protecting oneself one protects others? By
persistent practice, by cultivation, and by enhancement. It is in such
a way that by protecting oneself one protects others.</p>
<p>And how is it that by protecting others one protects oneself? By
patience, harmlessness, lovingkindness, and compassion. It is in such
a way that by protecting others one protects oneself.</p>
<p>When thinking, ‘I will protect myself’, one applies the foundations of
mindfulness; when thinking, ‘I will protect others’, one applies the
foundations of mindfulness. Protecting oneself, monks, one protects
others; protecting others, one protects oneself. {763}</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#mindfulness-for-wisdom-development-and-the-removal-of-mental-impurity" id="mindfulness-for-wisdom-development-and-the-removal-of-mental-impurity">Mindfulness for Wisdom Development and the Removal of Mental Impurity</a></h3>
<p>Heedfulness (<em>appamāda</em>) refers to seamless mindful awareness, to living
one’s life with constant mindfulness. Heedfulness makes one careful and
prudent; it prevents one from falling into bad or harmful ways. It leads
to self-restraint, warning one against infatuation and indulgence. It
urges one to not be complacent; it induces striving and encourages one
to continually develop in spiritual practice. It makes one constantly
aware of one’s responsibilities, by reminding one of what needs to be
done and what does not, of what has been accomplished and what remains
to be done. And it helps one to perform one’s various tasks with
circumspection and precision. Thus, as stated earlier, heedfulness is of
major significance in a system of ethics.</p>
<p>Heedfulness as an expression of mindfulness has a wide-ranging
significance in relation to one’s general conduct in life. Broadly
speaking, it is applicable from the stage of moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>) up
to the stage of concentration (<em>samādhi</em>). At these stages, mindfulness
is associated with a large number of other spiritual qualities,
particularly effort (<em>vāyāma</em>), with which it is combined at all times.</p>
<p>Looked at solely in terms of the mind during the process of wisdom
development (the use of wisdom to purify the mind), however, heedfulness
(<em>appamāda</em>) is not directly involved, but rather gives devoted support
and encouragement from without. At this stage, attention is confined to
the workings of the mind, finely discriminating between the various
phenomena present, in a moment-by-moment analysis. It is at this stage
that mindfulness is fully engaged and plays a prominent role, and is
referred to by its specific name: <em>sati</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>An understanding of the essential, unique meaning of <em>sati</em> may be
gained by contemplating its function on those occasions when its role is
clearly distinguishable from that of other spiritual factors, most
notably in the practice called the Four Foundations of Mindfulness
(<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em>). On such occasions the function of mindfulness can be
summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The primary function of mindfulness is that it prevents the mind from
distraction; it does not allow sense impressions to pass by unheeded. It
guards against absent-mindedness. It is attentive, as if keeping its
eyes on each impression that passes into consciousness and then bearing
down on it. When one wishes to concentrate on a particular object,
mindfulness maintains one’s attention fixedly upon it, not allowing the
object to slip away or disappear. By means of <em>sati</em>, one constantly
recollects the object and bears it in mind.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>One metaphor for mindfulness is a pillar, because it is firmly embedded
in its object of attention. Another metaphor is a gatekeeper, because it
watches over the various sense doors through which sense data pass,
inspecting all that enters. The ‘proximate cause’ (<em>padaṭṭhāna</em>) for the
arising of <em>sati</em> is firm and clear perception (<em>saññā</em>) of an object.
Alternatively, the proximate cause is any one of the Four Foundations of
Mindfulness (<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em>), which are discussed below.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the point of view of ethics, one can discern both
negating and positive aspects of mindfulness. As a negating factor,
mindfulness guards the mind; it defends against mental distraction,
protects one from making mistakes, and prevents one from falling into
undesirable mental states or situations. It allows no opportunity for
unwholesomeness to enter the mind and it prevents the misuse of thought.</p>
<p>On the positive side, mindfulness guides the stream of conscious
experience, the flow of thought, and indeed all of one’s actions, so
that they follow a desired course. It keeps the mind harnessed to its
chosen object. It is thus the tool for laying hold of an object of
attention, as if placing it in front of the mind for consideration.
{764}</p>
<p>In the Buddhist path of practice, there is great emphasis on the
importance of mindfulness. Indeed, the Buddha said that it is required
in every situation. Mindfulness is compared to salt, which must be used
in every curry, and to a prime minister, who is involved in every branch
of government. Mindfulness may either restrain or support the mind,
depending on the needs of the situation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Considering the attributes of mindfulness mentioned above, one sees the
benefits of developing mindfulness as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An ability to maintain and safeguard desired states of mind, by
monitoring the cognitive process and the stream of thought; one
accepts only that which is favourable to the mind and bars all that
which is not. Moreover, by regulating and stilling the thinking
process, one facilitates the attainment of concentration
(<em>samādhi</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom, both physical and mental, and ‘self-sufficiency’; the body
and the mind are intrinsically at ease and relaxed, ready to
encounter various situations, and able to effectively deal with
things in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ability, in states of concentration, to guide the cognitive
process and the stream of thought, and to expand their range of
activity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigation by the wisdom faculty proceeds with optimum clarity.
By taking hold of a meditation object and, as it were, placing it in
front of the mind for subsequent investigation, mindfulness acts as
a basis on which wisdom can be developed and brought to perfection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purification of all volitional actions of body, speech and mind;
a freedom from the tainted influence by craving and clinging.
Accompanied by clear comprehension (<em>sampajañña</em>), mindfulness
ensures that one’s actions are guided by wisdom – by pure, reasoned
discernment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two benefits listed above are the goals of an advanced stage of
spiritual development, and are obtained through a prescribed method of
practice referred to as the Four Foundations of Mindfulness
(<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em>).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#right-mindfulness-in-the-context-of-the-four-foundations-of-mindfulness" id="right-mindfulness-in-the-context-of-the-four-foundations-of-mindfulness">Right Mindfulness in the Context of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness</a></h3>
<p><em>Satipaṭṭhāna</em> may be translated as the ‘foundations of mindfulness’ or
the ‘establishing of mindfulness’ (i.e. the supervision or guidance by
mindfulness). Technically, this term refers to methods of applying
mindfulness that produce optimal results, as indicated by the Buddha’s
words in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, this is the chief path for the purification of beings, for
passing beyond sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain
and grief, for the attainment of the sublime way, for the realization
of Nibbāna – namely, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup></p>
<p><em>D. II. 290; M. I. 55-6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The cultivation of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness is a very popular
and revered method of Dhamma practice. It is considered to incorporate
both tranquillity meditation (<em>samatha</em>) and insight meditation
(<em>vipassanā</em>). A practitioner may develop tranquillity until the
attainment of <em>jhāna</em> (see the following section on concentration)
before developing insight based on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness
and reaching the final goal. Alternatively, he or she may develop
insight (again, based on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness) as the
principal form of meditation, relying on only a basic level of
concentration, just as much as is necessary for the task, and then reach
the final goal. {765}</p>
<p>Insight meditation (<em>vipassanā</em>) is a vital principle of Buddhist
practice, which, though widely discussed, is also widely misunderstood.
The following examination of the Foundations of Mindfulness
(<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em>), however brief, will shed some light on the meaning of
<em>vipassanā</em>, including its essential attributes, its range of
application, and its versatility, as well as the possibilities and
benefits of practising insight meditation in everyday life.</p>
<p>The Four Foundations of Mindfulness are outlined as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. Kāyānupassanā:</strong> contemplation of the body; mindfulness of the
body:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mindfulness of breathing (<em>ānāpānasati</em>): going to a secluded place,
sitting in a suitable posture for meditation, establishing
mindfulness, and focusing on various aspects of the in- and
out-breathing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mindfulness of posture (<em>iriyāpatha</em>): clearly perceiving the
present ‘mode’ or posture of the body, say of standing, walking,
sitting, or lying down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear comprehension (<em>sampajañña</em>): maintaining clear comprehension
in every activity, e.g.: moving forward, looking around, stretching
out the arms, dressing, drinking, eating, chewing, urinating,
defecating, waking up, going to sleep, speaking, and remaining
silent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meditation on the repulsive (<em>paṭikkūla-manasikāra</em>): contemplating
the body, from the top of the head to the soles of the feet, as a
repository of various unattractive constituents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meditation on the elements (<em>dhātu-manasikāra</em>): contemplating the
body by considering it separated into its four constituent elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nine cemetery contemplations (<em>nava-sīvathikā</em>): looking at corpses
in nine different stages of decay, from one newly dead to one
reduced to crumbling bones. In each case, one reflects that one’s
own body must meet a similar fate.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2. Vedanānupassanā:</strong> mindfulness of feeling (<em>vedanā</em>; sensation):
when a feeling of pleasure or pain or a neutral feeling arises, whether
dependent on material things (<em>sāmisa</em>) or independent of material
things (<em>nirāmisa</em>), one perceives it clearly, as it actually exists in
that moment of occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>3. Cittānupassanā:</strong> mindfulness of the nature of the mind; insight
into the state of the mind in any given moment. For example, one
perceives clearly whether the mind is lustful or free from lust, angry
or free from anger, deluded or free from delusion, agitated or
concentrated, liberated or fettered, etc.</p>
<p><strong>4. Dhammānupassanā:</strong> mindfulness of mind-objects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hindrances (<em>nīvaraṇa</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup> clearly perceiving, in each moment,
whether any of the five hindrances are present in the mind or not;
clearly perceiving how as-yet unarisen hindrances arise, how
hindrances already arisen may be abandoned, and how abandoned
hindrances may be prevented from arising again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aggregates (<em>khandha</em>): clearly understanding the five aggregates;
knowing the nature of each aggregate; knowing how each aggregate
arises and how it ceases. {766}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense spheres (<em>āyatana</em>): clearly understanding each of the six
internal sense bases and the six external sense objects;
understanding the mental fetters (<em>saṁyojana</em>) which arise dependent
on the sense spheres; knowing how unarisen fetters arise, how arisen
fetters may be abandoned, and how abandoned fetters may be prevented
from arising again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enlightenment factors (<em>bojjhaṅga</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup> clearly understanding, in
each moment, whether any of the seven factors of enlightenment are
present in the mind or not; knowing how unarisen enlightenment
factors arise, and knowing how arisen factors can be brought to
completion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noble truths (<em>ariya-sacca</em>): clearly perceiving the nature of the
Four Noble Truths.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta, at the end of every one of the above
clauses, there is an identical refrain:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A monk abides contemplating the body in the body internally (i.e. his
own body), or he abides contemplating the body in the body externally
(i.e. someone else’s body), or he abides contemplating the body in the
body both internally and externally. Or else he abides contemplating
the truth of origination in the body, or he abides contemplating the
truth of cessation in the body, or he abides contemplating the truth
of both origination and cessation in the body. Indeed, he establishes
mindfulness in front of him that ‘there is a body’ to the extent
necessary for knowledge and recollection. And he abides independently,
not clinging to anything in the world.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3><a class="header" href="#gist-of-the-foundations-of-mindfulness" id="gist-of-the-foundations-of-mindfulness">Gist of the Foundations of Mindfulness</a></h3>
<p>One may see from the description above that the practice of the Four
Foundations of Mindfulness (<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em>; this includes the practice
of <em>vipassanā</em>) does not require a withdrawal from society into
seclusion or a fixed time schedule. The Buddhist teachings therefore
encourage its practice and integration into daily life.</p>
<p>In essence, the teaching on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness
describes four areas in our lives which require the guidance and
supervision by mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), namely: (1) the body and physical
behaviour; (2) various sensations of pleasure and pain; (3) various
states of mind; and (4) thoughts and reflections. Sustaining mindfulness
at these four points helps to ensure a life free from danger and
suffering, and such a practice culminates in the realization of the
ultimate truth.</p>
<p>It is evident from the outline of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness
above that, in practice, mindfulness is never applied on its own, but
always in conjunction with other spiritual factors. One such factor,
which is not specifically mentioned in the standard sutta definition of
<em>sati</em> (above), is concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), which must be present, at
least in a weak form, sufficient for the task at hand.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup> The factors
which are specifically and regularly mentioned include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Ātāpī</em>: ‘ardour’, ‘effort’; this refers to right effort
(<em>sammā-vāyāma</em>), the sixth factor of the Eightfold Path, which
entails guarding against and abandoning what is unwholesome, and
cultivating and protecting what is wholesome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sampajāno</em>: ‘clear comprehension’, ‘full awareness’ (=
<em>sampajañña</em>); this refers to wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Satimā</em>: the possession of <em>sati</em>; this refers to the very factor
of mindfulness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the scriptures the term <em>sampajañña</em> usually appears coupled with the
term <em>sati</em>. As the term <em>sampajañña</em> refers to wisdom, training in
mindfulness is thus one part of wisdom development. {767} Clear
comprehension is the clear and penetrative understanding of those things
or activities focused on by mindfulness: one understands their nature
and their purpose; one knows how to relate to them, free from delusion
and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The subsequent phrase ‘free from covetousness and grief for the world’
(see above, under the definition of right mindfulness) demonstrates the
attitude resulting from having mindfulness and clear comprehension. A
person is equanimous and independent, unbound by defilements, neither
swayed by attachment nor by aversion.</p>
<p>In the ending refrain, the clause: ‘he contemplates origination and
cessation’ points to an understanding of things in light of the Three
Characteristics, giving rise to a perception and experience of things as
they actually exist. The phrase: ‘He establishes mindfulness in front of
him that “there is a body”,’ for example, refers to an awareness of the
body in its actuality, without clothing it in assumptions and cherished
beliefs, without labelling it as a ‘person’, as a ‘self’, as ‘him’,
‘her’, ‘me’, or ‘mine’. This attitude is one of freedom and
independence, in that it is not reliant on external conditions, and it
is free from attachment by way of craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) and grasping
(<em>upādāna</em>).</p>
<p>In this context, let us examine the meaning of some important Pali
terms:</p>
<p><em>Kāye kāyānupassī</em>: ‘contemplating the body in the body’. This is the
standard, literal translation, which can easily give rise to
misunderstanding. One can sympathize with the translators here, because
it is sometimes extremely difficult to convey a clear and concise
meaning of some Pali terms and phrases. This phrase refers to accurately
discerning at all times the body simply as a body, as nothing more than
a collection or assembly of various organs and component parts. One does
not see the body as being ‘him’, ‘her’, ‘me’, ‘John’, or ‘Susan’, etc.,
nor does one see it as belonging to anyone, as say ‘mine’ or ‘his’; when
looking at the hair or the face, one sees these for what they are, not
as a ‘man’ or a ‘woman’.</p>
<p>In other words, one sees directly in line with the truth, corresponding
with the actual state of the body; what one sees corresponds to what one
is looking at, that is, one looks at a body and sees a body, rather than
looking at a body and seeing ‘Mr. Smith’ or someone loathsome or someone
attractive. This is consistent with the saying of the old masters: ‘One
looks but does not see. One’s vision is distorted and one sees
otherwise. Not seeing, one is deluded. Deluded, one cannot escape.’ (See
Note <a href="#note-body-in-body">Contemplating the Body in the Body</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Contemplating the Body in the Body</span><a id="note-body-in-body"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>DA. III. 756; MA. I. 241; VbhA. 217. The commentaries offer four or
five different explanations for this expression ‘body in the body’,
most of which point to a person’s focus of attention.</p>
<p>For example: not to perceive things in a confused manner – to see the
body as the body; and not to see feelings, mind states, or mind
objects as the body.</p>
<p>Another interpretation is to see subsidiary physical parts within the
body as a whole; this is a way of dissecting or analyzing the body
until one discerns that there is nothing more to the body than a
collection of subsidiary parts; there is no ‘Mr. Addison’ or ‘Mrs.
Bartlett’. It is an analysis of a collective unit or an unraveling of
a clustered mass, like peeling back the leaves and leaf sheathes from
a banana tree until one sees there is in truth no tree as such. (The
same should be understood for ‘feelings in feelings’, ‘mind in mind’,
and ‘mind objects in mind objects’.)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><em>Ātāpī sampajāno satimā</em>: ‘ardent, fully aware, and mindful’. This
refers to right effort (<em>sammā-vāyāma</em>), right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>),
and right mindfulness (<em>sammā-sati</em>), the three constant factors of the
Noble Eightfold Path, which must always be applied in conjunction with
the development of every aspect of the Path:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Effort energizes the mind; it prevents the mind from becoming
discouraged or depressed, from wavering, flagging, or retreating,
and it gives no opportunity for unwholesome mind states to arise. It
is a force urging the mind to press on, and it fosters the growth of
wholesome qualities. {768}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear comprehension is equivalent to wisdom, which penetrates the
true nature of those objects focused upon by mindfulness, and it
prevents delusion from arising in regard to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mindfulness is the fixing and holding of attention on an object in
each moment, preventing forgetfulness and confusion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Vineyya loke abhijjhā-domanassaṃ</em>: ‘free from covetousness and grief in
the world’. This phrase refers to a freedom from desire and aversion,
likes and dislikes. By practising in this way, the mind is spacious and
bright; neither attachment nor aversion can overwhelm the mind.</p>
<p><em>Atthi kāyoti vā panassa sati paccupaṭṭhitā hoti yāvadeva ñāṇamattāya
paṭissatimattāya</em>: ‘He establishes mindfulness in front of him that
“there is a body”, to the extent necessary for knowledge and
recollection.’ A mindful person knows clearly and accurately that the
body is merely the body; one does not mistake it for a being, a person,
a man, or a woman, as a ‘self’, as ‘mine’ or ‘yours’. The purpose of
this reflection is for the sake of knowledge and recollection, for the
development of mindfulness, clear comprehension, and wisdom, and to ward
against fanciful proliferations. The same reflection applies to
feelings, the mind, and mind objects.</p>
<p><em>Anissito ca viharati</em>: ‘He dwells independently.’ This refers to a mind
that is free, not tied to any condition; one need not entrust oneself to
anything or anyone else. Technically speaking, one does not take refuge
in or rely on craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) and views (<em>diṭṭhi</em>). When cognizing
something one experiences it directly, according to how it actually
exists. One does not resort to craving and views in order to colour and
embellish the experience, to lull oneself into forgetfulness, or to
dictate one’s thoughts, reflections, and general wellbeing.</p>
<p><em>Na ca kiñci loke upādiyati</em>: ‘He does not cling to anything in the
world.’ One does not grasp at or attach to anything at all, whether
form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, or consciousness as
being self or belonging to self (<em>attaniya</em>).</p>
<p><em>Ajjhattaṃ vā... bahiddhā vā....</em>: ‘either internally or externally’.
Scholars have differed in their explanations of this phrase, but the
consensus of the commentators is that ‘internal’ refers to oneself and
‘external’ refers to others.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup> Such an interpretation corresponds
with the Abhidhamma texts, which elucidate the meaning of these terms,
for example: ‘And how does a monk see the mind in the mind externally?
Here, when another person’s mind is lustful, he clearly perceives that
that is so.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Some people may question whether it is appropriate to intrude and probe
into someone else’s mind, and whether this is even possible. A brief
answer to this question is that the Buddha encouraged us to apply
mindfulness to all things that we encounter, and to simply see these
things as they are. {769} In daily life we must interact with other
people, and we should do so mindfully. We should be aware of people as
they are, as they clearly manifest to us in our direct, personal
experience. (If one possesses the ability to read another person’s mind,
one knows directly according to this ability; if one does not have this
power then one need not be inquisitive.) This way one will not obsess
over other people and give rise to such unwholesome qualities as lust
and aversion. There is no obligation to monitor or pry into the affairs
of others. If, however, while say speaking to someone else who shows
signs of anger, one is unaware of his or her emotional state, how can
one claim to be practising the Foundations of Mindfulness and applying
them in daily life?</p>
<p>To summarize, the development of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness
entails living with mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) and clear comprehension
(<em>sampajañña</em>), which prevents any fixed perceptions of self generated
by ignorance to interfere with one’s thoughts and to cause problems.</p>
<p>Some Western scholars have compared the practice of the Four Foundations
of Mindfulness with contemporary methods of psychotherapy, and have come
to the conclusion that the former provides better results and greater
benefits, because everyone is able to apply this practice by him- or
herself, and can do so in everyday circumstances in order to maintain a
healthy state of mind.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Here, let us return to a summary of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness,
yet this time by using a contemporary mode of analysis.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#four-foundations-of-mindfulness-way-of-practice" id="four-foundations-of-mindfulness-way-of-practice">Four Foundations of Mindfulness: Way of Practice</a></h3>
<p>The constituent factors in the practice of the Four Foundations of
Mindfulness are twofold: the passive (that which is focused on,
observed, discerned), and the active (the act of observing, paying
attention, insight).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The passive constituents are those ordinary, mundane things common
to all of us: the body and its movements, thoughts, feelings, etc.,
which exist or manifest in the present moment of awareness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The active constituents are mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) and clear
comprehension (<em>sampajañña</em>), which are the principal factors in the
practice of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. These two agents
focus on and observe those things present in the mind, unfalteringly
and free from distraction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) is that which keeps hold of the chosen object;
clear comprehension (<em>sampajañña</em>) is the wisdom faculty, which clearly
discerns the nature and purpose of the object under investigation. For
example, while walking one is mindful of and fully present with the
movements of the body, and simultaneously one knows clearly the reason
for walking, the intended destination, and the factors related to
walking. Moreover, clear comprehension understands the object or the
action as it is, without coating it with preferences and aversions.</p>
<p>There is a matter of linguistics here that needs to be addressed. Some
people misconstrue the common definition of <em>sati</em> as ‘recollection’ and
the definition of <em>sampajañña</em> as ‘self-awareness’, leading to misguided
practice. They establish mind-fulness on the sense of self and then have
the impression that they are the agents for various actions, thinking,
‘I am doing this’, ‘I am doing that’; as a result they create or
reinforce the concept of self. They become preoccupied with this
self-image and develop a rigidity of mind. At the very least, their
minds are not truly focused on the activity and their efforts thus do
not come to fruition. {770}</p>
<p>Someone prone to such misunderstanding should recall the definition of
<em>sati</em> as ‘bearing in mind’, ‘sustaining attention on the object or task
at hand’, and ‘sustaining attention on the flow of events’. Similarly,
one should recall the definition of <em>sampajañña</em> as ‘clear comprehension
of an object of attention’ or ‘clear comprehension of one’s current
activity’. In other words, it is not a matter of focusing on the sense
of self (’I am doing this’). Rather than focusing on the ‘performer’ of
the task, one focuses on the task itself. One’s attention is so present
and focused that eventually there is no opportunity for a sense of self
to interfere in the process.</p>
<p>The essential feature of mindfulness is an accurate, undistorted
perception of things. One sees and understands what the object of
awareness is, how it manifests, and what effects it has in each moment.
This entails a constant acknowledging, observing, contemplating, and
understanding. One does not react to the object, evaluate it, criticize
it, or judge it as being good or bad, right or wrong, etc. One does not
paste one’s emotions, biases, or attachments onto the object, say as
being agreeable or disagreeable, satisfactory or unacceptable. One
merely discerns how that object, condition, or quality actually is,
without supplementing one’s perception with such thoughts as ‘mine’,
‘his’, ‘us’, ‘them’, ‘Mr. Crabtree’, ‘Mrs. Simpkins’, etc.</p>
<p>Take the example of mindfulness of feelings (<em>vedanā</em>): in this very
moment, one knows, for instance, that mental discomfort exists; one
knows that it has arisen, one knows the way in which it came about, and
one knows how it is gradually dissipating. Similarly, one is mindful of
‘mind objects’ (<em>dhammārammaṇa</em>): if worry or anxiety arises, one
observes such emotions and contemplates how they have come about and how
they unfold. If anger arises, the very awareness of this anger leads to
its dissipation. One then reflects on that past anger, contemplating its
advantages, its ill-effects, its causes, and its ending. Eventually, it
can become enjoyable to study, reflect on, and investigate one’s own
suffering!</p>
<p>When it is pure, unadulterated suffering arising and passing away, and
there is no trace of ‘my suffering’ or ‘I am suffering’, then that
suffering is robbed of all its power to harm the one who contemplates
it. Whatever form of virtue or vice exists externally or is present in
the mind, one faces up to it, without any evasion or avoidance. One pays
close attention to it, from the moment of its arising until it reaches
its natural end. It is similar to watching actors perform a play or to
being a bystander at some event. It is an attitude comparable to that of
a doctor performing an autopsy or that of a scientist analyzing a
subject of research, rather than that of a judge settling a case between
plaintiff and defendant. It is an objective rather than a subjective
approach.</p>
<p>The constant application of mindfulness and clear comprehension implies
living in the present moment. One is aware in each moment of what is
arising, what is happening, or what one is doing; attention does not
slip. One does not attach to or linger over past events, and one does
not drift off into the future in search of things that do not yet exist.
If some unresolved matter from the past or some future obligation should
be considered, mindfulness lays hold of the relevant details and the
wisdom faculty reflects on them in a purposeful way, so that these
matters become the present object of awareness. One does not get caught
up in aimless thought, nostalgic reminiscence, or fantasies of the
future. By dwelling in the present moment, one is not enslaved, seduced,
or driven by craving. One lives wisely, freed from various forms of
suffering, such as grief, regret, worry, and depression. This way of
life leads to an awareness accompanied by spaciousness, clarity and
ease. {771}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#fruits-of-mindfulness-practice" id="fruits-of-mindfulness-practice">Fruits of Mindfulness Practice</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Purity: when mindfulness is focused on a chosen object and when
clear comprehension understands that thing in its true light, then
the stream of cognition and thought is purified, for there will be
no room for mental defilements to arise. When one discerns phenomena
simply as they are, without colouring the experience by emotions or
reacting from personal prejudices and preferences, there is no
clinging. This is a way to eliminate existing mental taints
(<em>āsava</em>) and to prevent newly-founded taints from arising.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liberation: when the mind is purified as described above it is also
liberated; it is not shaken or disturbed by sense impressions,
because they are used as food for contemplation in a purely
objective way. When these things are not misinterpreted by
subjective mental taints they have no power over people, and one’s
behaviour is freed from the controlling influence of unconscious
drives and motivations. This is what is referred to by the passage:
‘One abides independently, not clinging to anything in the
world.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wisdom: when the mind is thus purified and liberated, wisdom
functions most effectively, because the mind is not ‘coated over’ or
detracted by emotions, prejudices, and biases. One then sees things
as they are, according to the truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom from suffering: when this state of vigilance and true
understanding of things is sustained, prejudicial responses, either
in a negative or a positive sense, which do not accord with pure
reasoned discernment, cannot arise. There are no feelings of
covetousness (<em>abhijjhā</em>) or resentment (<em>domanassa</em>), and there is
a liberation from all forms of anxiety. This is called freedom from
suffering, which is marked by unbounded clarity, ease, peace, and
contentment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, these four fruits of practice are interrelated, or they are
aspects of the same thing. From the perspective of the teachings on
Dependent Origination (<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>) and on the Three
Characteristics (<em>tilakkhaṇa</em>), one can conclude the following: at
first, most people are ignorant of the fact that the so-called ‘self’
they cling to is ultimately non-existent. People exist merely as a
continuum of myriad interrelated and interdependent physical and mental
phenomena, which continually arise, transform, and disperse.</p>
<p>When one is unaware of this truth, one repeatedly clings to emotions,
thoughts, desires, habits, opinions, beliefs, perceptions, etc. and one
identifies with these. Although the resulting sense of self undergoes a
constant transformation, one thinks: ‘I was that; now, I am this’, ‘I
felt that way; now, I feel this way.’</p>
<p>To engage in such self-identification is to be deceived by such things
as thoughts and feelings, which are merely subsidiary mental factors
(<em>nāma-dhamma</em>) active in that particular moment. This deception is the
source of wrong thinking. As a consequence, one’s thoughts, feelings,
and actions are motivated and driven by the exigencies of whatever is
being clung to as self at the moment.</p>
<p>When one practises in line with the Foundations of Mindfulness, one sees
each material and mental component within a specific process as arising
and ceasing according to its own nature. By analyzing and distinguishing
each factor of this moment-to-moment continuum, one is not deceived into
grasping onto things and identifying with them as ‘self’. These things
thus lose their power of coercion. {772}</p>
<p>If this insight attains an optimum profundity and clarity, one realizes
liberation. The mind is established in a new mode of being, which is
pure, spacious, free from mental bias and attachment. Even one’s
personality is altered.</p>
<p>This is a state of perfect mental health. It is comparable to a body
which is in perfect health, when, in the absence of disease, all of its
organs function smoothly and normally. Indeed, the practice of the Four
Foundations of Mindfulness is a method of cleansing the mind of mental
illness, of completely eliminating those things that restrict, obstruct,
and impede the mind. A person is then prepared to face and deal with all
things in the world resolutely and with joy.</p>
<p>This matter can be summarized with the following teachings by the
Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are two kinds of illness: physical illness and mental
illness. There are to be seen beings who can assert to be without
illness of the body for an entire year. There are to be seen beings
who can assert to be without illness of the body for two years...
three years... four years... five years... ten years... twenty
years... thirty years... forty years... fifty years... a hundred
years. But beings who can assert to be without illness of the mind,
even for an instant, are difficult to find in the world, with the
exception of those who are free from the taints.</p>
<p><em>A. II. 143.</em></p>
<p><em>Ven. Sāriputta:</em> ‘Householder, your faculties are bright, your facial
complexion is pure and radiant. Did you get to hear a Dhamma talk
today in the presence of the Blessed One?’</p>
<p><em>Nakulapitā:</em> ‘Why not, venerable sir? Just now I was anointed by the
Blessed One with the ambrosia of a Dhamma talk.’</p>
<p><em>Ven. Sāriputta:</em> ‘In what manner did the Blessed One anoint you with
the ambrosia of a Dhamma talk?’</p>
<p><em>Nakulapitā:</em> ‘Here, venerable sir, I approached the Blessed One, paid
homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: “I am old,
venerable sir, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, afflicted
in body, often ill. I rarely get to see the Blessed One and the
bhikkhus who are a cause for delight. Let the Blessed One exhort me,
venerable sir, let him instruct me, since that would lead to my
welfare and happiness for a long time.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha replied]: “So it is, householder, so it is! This body is
afflicted, like an egg which is covered by a shell. If anyone carrying
around this body were to claim to be without illness even for a
moment, what would this be other than foolishness? Therefore,
householder, you should train yourself thus: ‘Even though I am
afflicted in body, my mind will be unafflicted.’ “</p>
<p>‘It was with the ambrosia of such a Dhamma talk, venerable sir, that
the Blessed One anointed me.’ {773}</p>
<p><em>S. III. 2.</em></p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#momentary-awareness-is-essential-for-insight-meditation" id="momentary-awareness-is-essential-for-insight-meditation">Momentary Awareness Is Essential for Insight Meditation</a></h3>
<p>People’s most ordinary, mundane activity, one that is going on
constantly in their daily lives, is the cognition of sense impressions
through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. Cognition is
always accompanied by a feeling – either of pleasure, pain, or a
neutral feeling. In response to feelings, the mind reacts: if the object
is pleasant there arises desire and delight; if the object is unpleasant
or painful, there arises annoyance and aversion.</p>
<p>When there is liking of something, one wishes to experience more of it,
to repeat the enjoyment, to obtain or possess the object. When there is
dislike of something, one wishes to escape from it, to rid oneself of it
or destroy it. This process is continuing all the time, both on subtle
levels which tend to remain unobserved, and, on occasion, with an
intensity which is plainly recognizable and which inflicts clearly
discernible and lasting effects on the mind. These powerful or
unsettling experiences tend to generate long and involved mental
proliferations, and if they are not resolved they intrude into the whole
range of one’s speech and actions.</p>
<p>People’s lives, their roles in society, and their interactions with
others, issue primarily from this incessant contact with sense
impressions which is present in every moment of human existence.</p>
<p>Heedlessly abandoning the mind to the process of delighting in pleasure
and comfort and resisting pain and discomfort impedes the development of
wisdom. One will be prevented from discerning the true nature of things.
A lack of restraint in this matter creates the following obstacles:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The mind falls under the sway of liking and disliking and it gets
stuck at these points of reaction. One’s vision is thus obscured and
one sees things from a biased perspective, not according to how they
truly are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mind falls into the past or drifts into the future. When one
experiences a sense impression and either delight or aversion
arises, the mind gets stuck at the point or feature of that object
that is considered agreeable or disagreeable. One then makes a
mental image of these agreeable or disagreeable features, nourishes
it, and proliferates over it. Dwelling on particular agreeable or
disagreeable aspects of something, and clinging to concepts or
images of it, is equivalent to slipping into the past. The ensuing
mental proliferations over these images entail drifting off into the
future. A person’s understanding of the object – the mind-created
images based on likes and dislikes, or the embellished ideas about
it – is in fact not a true understanding of the object as it truly
exists in the present moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mind is subject to proliferated thinking, which interprets the
meaning of what is sensed or experienced in the light of one’s
personal history or ingrained habits, e.g. according to one’s
cherished views, values, and opinions. The mind is at the mercy of
these proliferations; it is unable to see things objectively and
purely as they are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mind adds embellished mental images of new experiences to one’s
preexisting mental biases and habits, thus compounding one’s
habitual patterns of reaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The negative characteristics of mind mentioned above do not pertain only
to the coarse and shallow matters of one’s daily life and general
affairs. The Buddhist teachings emphasize their manifestation at the
subtle and profound level of the mental continuum. It is through their
presence that ordinary, unawakened beings are led to see things as
stable and substantially real, to perceive inherent beauty or ugliness
in them, to attach to conventional truths, and to to overlook the
all-encompassing law of causality. {774}</p>
<p>People accumulate habits and conditioned tendencies of misperceiving
existence almost from the day they are born, and go twenty or thirty
years, forty or fifty years, even longer than that, without ever
training themselves to break the cycle of wrong thinking. Dealing with
and rectifying this situation is thus not easy. At the very moment that
one becomes conscious of an object, before one has had time to steady
oneself to check the process, the mind has already switched into an
habitual response.</p>
<p>The remedy in this case is not simply a matter of cutting a cycle of
reactivity and abrogating a conditioned process, but also necessitates
curbing the habitual tendencies and dispositions of the mind that flow
strongly along fixed channels.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is an essential factor here for clearing the way and for
marshalling other spiritual factors. The practice of the Four
Foundations of Mindfulness has the following objectives: through
mindfully keeping pace with experience and seeing things in their bare
actuality, one breaks the circuit of deluded thought, destroys
unwholesome mental dynamics, modifies old conditioning, and cultivates
new dispositions in the mind.</p>
<p>A mind possessing such moment-to-moment awareness is endowed with
characteristics which are the complete antithesis of those shown by a
mind caught up in the flow of unwholesome conditioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Attachment and aversion have no opportunity to arise in the mind,
because their presence is dependent on the mind seizing on and
lingering over a particular point or aspect of an object, and thus
being caught up in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachment and aversion exist when there is a falling away from the
present moment. A consequence of a free, unentangled mind, which
observes things as they arise from moment to moment, is that it does
not slip into the past or drift off into the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mind is not subject to mental proliferations based on past
conditioning, which lead to a biased, distorted, and coloured
experience of phenomena; the mind is prepared to see things as they
truly are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mind does not compound or intensify bad habits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one pays attention to phenomena as they arise in each moment,
one perceives certain character traits in oneself which are
unwelcome or unacknowledged. With mindfulness, one can face up to
these qualities as they are, without seeking to avoid them and
without any self-deception. One is thus able to cleanse such
impurities from the mind and to solve personal difficulties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mind endowed with constant mindfulness is unconstricted and
untarnished; it is pure, radiant, spacious, joyous, and free.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All things exist and proceed according to their own nature. Figuratively
speaking, the truth is revealing itself at all times, yet people tend to
shut themselves off from it; alternatively they see things in a
distorted manner or deceive themselves as to the nature of truth
altogether. The cause for this concealment, distortion, and deception is
the immersion in the conditioned stream of heedless abandon to pleasure
and discomfort detailed above. The factors for distortion and delusion
are strong in themselves; add to these the compulsive and misleading
power of habit, and the chance to really know the truth is almost
non-existent.</p>
<p>Because personal habits and dispositions have been accumulated steadily
over an extremely long period of time, the practice to remedy them and
to create a new mode of relating to the world is also likely to require
a long time. {775}</p>
<p>Whenever mindfulness is consistent and proficient – when one does not
evade the truth, does not distort the things one sees, and escapes the
power of old conditioning – one is prepared to see things as they are
and to understand the truth. At this point, if other spiritual
faculties, especially wisdom, are well-developed, they will join forces
with mindfulness by relying on it to operate in the most effective way,
giving rise to ‘knowledge and vision’ (<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>), which is the
goal of insight meditation. To gain mastery in wisdom (and in other
spiritual faculties), however, depends on gradual training and on basic
study. Study and reasoned analysis therefore are supportive for the
realization of truth.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-foundations-of-mindfulness-nourish-the-enlightenment-factors" id="the-foundations-of-mindfulness-nourish-the-enlightenment-factors">The Foundations of Mindfulness Nourish the Enlightenment Factors</a></h3>
<p>Mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) is not the same as insight (<em>vipassanā</em>); indeed,
it is wisdom or the application of wisdom that is equivalent to insight.
Wisdom, however, operates in a reliable, fully proficient way when
supported and guided by mindfulness, as described above. The development
of mindfulness is thus of great importance for insight meditation. In
other words, mindfulness is developed simultaneously with wisdom, or the
practice of mindfulness is performed in order to gain proficiency in
wisdom. In the terminology of spiritual practice, the mention of
mindfulness usually includes the joint factor of ‘clear comprehension’
(<em>sampajañña</em>), which is equivalent to wisdom, and the strength and
fluency of mindfulness depends on the participation by wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>The wisdom that accompanies mindfulness in everyday activities is
generally referred to as ‘clear comprehension’ (<em>sampajañña</em>). At this
stage wisdom is only a supporting factor in practice, cooperating and
collaborating with mindfulness. Here, mindfulness is viewed as the
principal or prominent factor. When it comes to more subtle levels of
investigation, however, prominence shifts to wisdom, and mindfulness is
relegated to a role of serving wisdom. An example of wisdom functioning
on this level is ‘investigation of Dhamma’ (<em>dhamma-vicaya</em>) contained
in the Seven Factors of Enlightenment.</p>
<p>It seems appropriate here to review the teaching mentioned at the
beginning of the chapter introducing the Middle Way, which describes how
the Four Foundations of Mindfulness nourish and support the seven
factors of enlightenment (<em>bojjhaṅga</em>), which in turn nourish and
support true knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>) and liberation (<em>vimutti</em>), as
confirmed by this passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, liberation and supreme knowledge have their nutriment, I
declare; they are not without a nutriment. And what is the nutriment
of liberation and supreme knowledge? ‘The seven factors of
enlightenment’ should be the answer. The seven factors of
enlightenment, too, have their nutriment; they are not without a
nutriment. And what is the nutriment of the seven factors of
enlightenment? ‘The Four Foundations of Mindfulness’ should be the
answer....</p>
<p>When the Four Foundations of Mindfulness are fulfilled, they bring
about the fulfilment of the seven factors of enlightenment. When the
seven factors of enlightenment are fulfilled, they bring about the
fulfilment of liberation and supreme knowledge. Such is the
nourishment and fulfilment of liberation and supreme knowledge.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. V. 114.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>From this passage it is clear that the seven factors of enlightenment
generate true knowledge and liberation; they enable the realization of
Path and Fruit. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness help by nourishing
the seven factors of enlightenment. {776}</p>
<p>This passage elucidates the process of insight meditation. In the
practice of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) is
the constant, basic factor, while wisdom, under the name of clear
comprehension (<em>sampajañña</em>), operates in tandem, by understanding
everything that mindfulness observes or engages with. Mindfulness
focuses on things in order for clear comprehension to understand them,
just as one may grasp an object in one’s hand in order to look at it
closely with one’s eyes.</p>
<p>The Four Foundations of Mindfulness act as a basis for the seven factors
of enlightenment. Mindfulness focuses on an object and submits it to
wisdom, which here is called ‘investigation of truth’ (<em>dhamma-vicaya</em>).
At this stage wisdom is the predominant factor, investigating the object
just as one uses one’s eyes to thoroughly inspect something. This is the
process of wisdom as an enlightenment factor.</p>
<p>In any case, whether wisdom is referred to as ‘clear comprehension’,
‘investigation of truth’, or by any other designation, if it leads to a
realization of things as they truly are and to the deliverance of the
heart, then it is encompassed in the meaning of the term <em>vipassanā</em>
(’insight’).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Mindfulness plays an important role in both tranquillity meditation
(<em>samatha</em>) and in insight meditation (<em>vipassanā</em>). An examination of
the role of mindfulness in these two forms of meditation sheds light on
the subject described above.</p>
<p>In tranquillity meditation, mindfulness keeps attention focused on a
single object, or it holds an object in awareness, in order to achieve
one-pointed concentration. The mind then becomes peaceful and still; it
is free from distraction and agitation. When the mind has reached this
one-pointed, unwavering, and steady concentration, tranquillity
meditation is accomplished.</p>
<p>In insight meditation, mindfulness similarly holds an object in
awareness or directs attention to an object, but it uses the mind as the
platform on which an object is placed for inspection by wisdom. Here,
one takes hold of the object in order to let wisdom investigate and
analyze it, using the firm and stable mind as one’s laboratory.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>The practice of tranquillity meditation is like tying a wild young bull
to a post with a rope. All it can do is circle around the post to which
it is bound, until, eventually, when its stubbornness has abated, it
lies down meekly at the foot of the post. Here, the mind is compared to
the wild young bull, the meditation object to the post, and mindfulness
to the rope.</p>
<p>The practice of insight meditation is like fixing a specimen onto a flat
surface to allow a subsequent examination to proceed smoothly and with
precision. Here, the means used to pin down the specimen is compared to
mindfulness, the specimen to the meditation object, the surface to a
concentrated mind, and the examination to wisdom.</p>
<p>So far, the primary principles of these two forms of meditation have
been discussed. In this context, there are a few additional observations
and distinctions to make:</p>
<p>The objective of tranquillity meditation is to make the mind calm. In
this context, when mindfulness directs attention to an object, it
fastens onto it with the sole aim of producing a firm and unswerving
concentration on the object, preventing even the slightest deviation of
awareness, until the mind dwells unwaveringly on a ‘mental image’
(<em>nimitta</em>; ‘sign’) of the meditation object. Tranquillity meditation
thus involves fixing attention on an object that is merely a perception
created in the mind by the meditator.</p>
<p>In insight meditation, on the other hand, the aim is towards knowledge
and understanding of the way things are. Here, mindfulness focuses only
on truly existent phenomena, in order for wisdom to fully and clearly
comprehend the nature of their existence. It focuses on things from the
moment of their arising through their gradual decline and eventual
disintegration, enabling wisdom to gain a thorough understanding of
them.</p>
<p>Insight meditation demands an awareness of every kind of sense
impression which impinges on consciousness so that wisdom can comprehend
each one in its actuality. Thus the object in focus is not a fixed one,
and to ensure an accurate and authentic comprehension, one must be
mindful of the changing nature of phenomena in every moment, to prevent
one’s attention from lingering on any one object or aspect of an object.
{777}</p>
<p>In tranquillity meditation, mindfulness focuses on an object that is
either stationary or moves within a repetitive and fixed pattern. In
insight meditation, mindfulness focuses on an object in whatever state
of movement or change it may exist, without restriction.</p>
<p>In tranquillity meditation one selects a certain defined object that is
considered conducive for calm and concentration. In insight meditation,
one may focus on any object without exception; whatever manifests in the
mind and lends itself to investigation; whatever permits a glimpse of
the truth is valid. In the context of insight meditation, these objects
may be summarized as mental objects (<em>nāma-dhammā</em>) and physical objects
(<em>rūpa-dhammā</em>), or as body, feelings, mind, and mind objects – the
Four Foundations of Mindfulness.</p>
<p>Another crucial factor for spiritual practice, an examination of which
helps to clarify the unique qualities distinguishing insight meditation
from tranquillity meditation, is analytical reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>; ‘wise reflection’). Analytical reflection gives
rise to wisdom and is thus essential to insight meditation.</p>
<p>In tranquillity meditation, although analytical reflection may be
supportive in many circumstances, it is of lesser significance. In some
cases it need not be applied at all, or else ordinary contemplation
(<em>manasikāra</em>) is sufficient. In this context, mindfulness is used to
direct attention to an object until the mind becomes one-pointed. Here,
if all goes smoothly and results are duly experienced, there is no need
to make use of analytical reflection.</p>
<p>In some situations, however, when the mind does not sustain an interest
in the meditation object, when attention wavers and becomes distracted,
or else with those meditation themes, e.g. lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>),
which require a certain measure of reflective thought, one may need a
skilful means to guide the mind. In such a case, one needs to apply wise
and systematic reflection, to manage the thought-process, and to lead
the mind in a correct direction. An example is knowing how to reflect so
as to reduce anger and replace it with lovingkindness.</p>
<p>In any case, in tranquillity meditation the kind of wise reflection that
may be required is limited to that used for rousing wholesome
qualities.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup> It is not necessary to apply the kind of wise reflection
used for promoting realization of the truth.</p>
<p>In insight meditation, on the other hand, the application of analytical
reflection is a singularly important step on the path to wisdom and is
thus an essential factor. Analytical reflection paves the way for wisdom
and is conducive to its further development. (See
Note <a href="#note-wisdom-faith">Wisdom, Faith and Reflection</a>) Its function and characteristics are so
similar to wisdom that these two Pali terms – <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em> and
<em>paññā</em> – are often used interchangeably, which often causes students
of Buddhism to have difficulty in distinguishing between them. {778}</p>
<p>Analytical reflection acts as a link between mindfulness and wisdom. It
is the vanguard of wisdom; it facilitates a form of thinking that
promotes the effective functioning of wisdom. In other words, analytical
reflection provides wisdom with a mode of operation; it is a method of
applying wisdom in the most effective way.</p>
<p>The reason why some people are confused by these terms is that, in
general parlance, <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em> refers both to the methods of
contemplation, which comprise the very factor of <em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>,
and to the subsequent application of wisdom in line with these methods.
This ambiguity may also occur when discussing the practical expressions
of wisdom. For instance, when using the term ‘investigation of truth’
(<em>dhamma-vicaya</em>), there is a tacit understanding that in this context
the wisdom faculty investigates by relying on one of the methods
provided by analytical reflection. In general, the meaning of the term
<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em> implies both reflection and wisdom – reflection
accompanied by wisdom – i.e. ‘wise reflection’.</p>
<p>As a sequence of events, this process unfolds in this way: when
mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) lays an object down in full view of the mind,
analytical reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) holds this object in
attention and turns it over so that wisdom (<em>paññā</em>) can investigate it.
Wisdom attends to the object according to the manner and direction
determined by analytical reflection. If analytical reflection lays the
foundation and sets the direction correctly, then wisdom bears fruit.
Mindfulness is present at every stage of this process; it does not
disappear or slip away. Whenever analytical reflection is functioning,
mindfulness is present. These two factors are mutually supportive in
insight meditation.</p>
<p>A comparison may be made to a person in a rowboat out on a fast-flowing,
choppy river, collecting flowers or greens along the shore. First, that
person ties up the boat or anchors it in such a way that it will remain
stationary at the spot where the plants grow. Then, with one hand he
grasps hold of the stems, gathering them together and exposing them as
conveniently as possible for harvesting. With the other hand, using the
tool he has prepared for the job, he cuts them off.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Wisdom, Faith and Reflection</span><a id="note-wisdom-faith"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In relation to wisdom, faith (<em>saddhā</em>) and analytical reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) lead to different results.</p>
<p>The establishment of some kinds of faith is like digging a fixed
channel through which thought processes move. Analytical reflection,
on the other hand, paves a way for wisdom to function effectively in
each new situation.</p>
<p>The Buddhist teachings promote a faith that is linked to wisdom: a
faith that provides an opportunity for wise reflection. An example of
faith as a fixed channel is the belief that all things are
predestined; a person does not contemplate any further than this. An
example of faith leading to wise reflection is that of someone, who,
although he has not yet fully realized the truth, has faith in the
Buddha’s teaching that all things exist according to causes and
conditions. This faith leads the person to apply wise reflection in
different circumstances, to inquire into the relevant causes and
conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Here, mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) is compared to the rope or anchor which
stabilizes the boat, enabling the person to remain within reach of the
plants. The boat (or person in the boat), held steady at a given spot,
is compared to the mind. The hand which grasps the plant stems and holds
them in a convenient way is like analytical reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>). The other hand, using a sharp tool to cut off the
stems, is like wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup> {779}</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#right-concentration-sammā-samādhi" id="right-concentration-sammā-samādhi">Right Concentration (sammā-samādhi)</a></h2>
<p>Right concentration is the final factor in the Eightfold Path. Because
concentration is connected to the cultivation of the mind in its
entirety, there is a great deal of material for study in relation to
this factor. Concentration involves refined states of mind and its
development is highly detailed and complex. One may say that
concentration marks the point where all eight factors of the Path
converge and engage in unison.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#definition-of-samādhi" id="definition-of-samādhi">Definition of Samādhi</a></h3>
<p>The term <em>samādhi</em> refers to ‘mental concentration’ or ‘one-pointed
attention’. A common definition for <em>samādhi</em> is <em>cittassekaggatā</em>, or
simply <em>ekaggatā</em>, which literally means ‘the state of focused attention
on one object’. The mind is firmly established on one object; attention
is not distracted and does not waver.</p>
<p>The commentaries define <em>samādhi</em> as a wholesome mind attentive on one
object, balanced and well-steadied, or simply as a steadfast mind.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn30">30</a></sup>
They describe the essence of concentration as non-distraction and
non-wavering. Concentration helps to gather together accompanying
spiritual factors, just as water helps to bind flour together and
prevent it from being dispersed. Concentration manifests as tranquillity
and it possesses happiness as its unique proximate cause. A concentrated
mind is steadfast and still, like a candle flame in a location free of
wind. The candle burns in a steady, even way; it is not immobile, but it
is tranquil.</p>
<p>In the suttas ‘right concentration’ is defined in terms of the four
jhānas:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, what is right concentration? Here, a monk in this Dhamma and
Discipline:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states,
he enters upon and abides in the first jhāna, which is accompanied
by applied &amp; sustained thought, (vitakka &amp; vicāra; ‘initial &amp;
sustained attention’), with rapture (pīti) and pleasure (sukha)
born of seclusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He enters upon and abides in the second jhāna, which has clarity
of mind and one-pointedness (ekaggatā), without applied and
sustained thought, which have been stilled, with rapture and
pleasure born of concentration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the fading away of rapture, he abides in equanimity, mindful
and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with the body,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup> he
enters upon and abides in the third jhāna, on account of which the
noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding, equanimous and
mindful.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous
disappearance of joy and grief, he enters upon and abides in the
fourth jhāna, which has neither pleasure nor pain and purity of
mindfulness due to equanimity (upekkhā).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>E.g.: D. II. 312-13; M. I. 62; M. III. 252; Vbh. 105.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This definition for concentration should be considered as a way to
describe the fulfilment of concentration. This is because the suttas
sometimes define the faculty of concentration simply as ‘one-pointedness
of mind’ (<em>cittassekaggatā</em>), for example: {780}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, what is the faculty of concentration? Here, the noble disciple
gains concentration, gains one-pointedness of mind, having made
relinquishment the object of attention. The is called the faculty of
concentration.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 198, 200.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The commentaries offer this definition for right concentration:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>What is right concentration? The establishment of the mind, the
steadfastness of the mind, the stability of the mind, the
non-wavering, non-distraction of the mind, the non-swaying of the
mind, tranquillity (samatha), the faculty of concentration, the power
of concentration, balanced concentration, the enlightenment factor of
concentration, which is a factor of the Path, connected to the Path.
This is called right concentration.</p>
<p><em>Vbh. 107, 238.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In sum, right concentration is applied for the goal of liberation and
developed to support wisdom, which understands things as they truly
are.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup> It is not used to satisfy worldly desires, for example by
becoming an accomplished meditator in order to boast about one’s psychic
abilities. There are teachings in the scriptures confirming that Dhamma
practitioners can develop insight by using only a basic level of
concentration (referred to as ‘insight concentration’ –
<em>vipassanā-samādhi</em>): a concentration accompanied by wisdom or a
concentration applied for developing penetrative insight, which lies
between ‘momentary concentration’ (<em>khaṇika-samādhi</em>) and ‘access
concentration’ (<em>upacāra-samādhi</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn34">34</a></sup></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#levels-of-concentration" id="levels-of-concentration">Levels of Concentration</a></h3>
<p>The commentaries divide concentration into three stages:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn35">35</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Khaṇika-samādhi</em>: momentary concentration. This is an elementary
stage of concentration, which people can apply and benefit from in
everyday work and activities. It is also the starting point for the
development of insight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Upacāra-samādhi</em>: ‘access’ or ‘neighbourhood’ concentration. This
level of concentration suppresses the five hindrances, and occurs
before the mind accesses a state of jhāna; it is the initial stage
of ‘attainment concentration’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Appanā-samādhi</em>: ‘attainment’ concentration; established
concentration. This is the highest stage, the fulfilment of
concentration, which is present at all levels of jhāna.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The second and third kinds of concentration are mentioned frequently in
the scriptural explanations of formal meditation techniques
(<em>kammaṭṭhāna</em>), and they are defined in a clear fashion. Access
concentration occurs when the mind relinquishes the five hindrances.
When a person is focusing on an object of meditation, access
concentration occurs with the arising of a ‘counterpart sign’
(<em>paṭibhāga-nimitta</em>; a mental image of the object of meditation. This
image is more refined and profound than an ordinary mental impression;
it arises from pure perception and is free from both colour and blemish;
a person is able to enlarge or minimize it at will).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn36">36</a></sup> Access
concentration is on the verge of complete concentration; the mind is
just about to reach jhāna. {781} Skill and proficiency in access
concentration results in a settled state of mind, which develops into
attainment concentration. (See
Note <a href="#note-access-concentration">Access Concentration</a>) From this point the jhāna
factors are fully present.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Access Concentration</span><a id="note-access-concentration"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In access concentration the five hindrances are abandoned and the
jhāna factors begin to arise, similar to attainment concentration. The
difference is that here the jhāna factors are not strong enough: a
person obtains a mental sign (<em>nimitta</em>) for a short period of time
but then the mind drops into subliminal consciousness (<em>bhavaṅga</em>) –
attention rises and drops, rises and drops.</p>
<p>It is like training an infant to stand – he props himself up and then
falls again. In attainment concentration on the other hand the jhāna
factors have adequate power; the mind is removed from the stream of
subliminal consciousness for a stretch of time; it can be established
in this state continuously. This is like a strong adult person, who
gets up from a seat and is able to work all day (see: Vism. 126-7,
146-7).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The scriptures, however, do not seem to provide a clear definition for
the first level of concentration. To help here, an outline of momentary
concentration, describing its essential features, may be formed from the
following sources:</p>
<p>The Paramatthamañjusā<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn37">37</a></sup> claims that momentary concentration
(<em>khaṇika-samādhi</em>) is comprised of <em>mūla-samādhi</em> (’basic
concentration’, ‘initial concentration’) and <em>parikamma-samādhi</em>
(’preparatory concentration’, ‘initial application concentration’),
which are mentioned in the Visuddhimagga.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentaries give examples from the Pali Canon describing how ‘basic
concentration’ (<em>mūla-samādhi</em>) is equivalent to momentary
concentration:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monk, you should train yourself thus: ‘Inwardly, my mind shall become
firmly established and well-composed; and evil, unwholesome states
shall find no footing in the mind.’ Thus should you train yourself.</p>
<p>When inwardly your mind is firmly established and well-composed, and
evil, unwholesome states find no footing in the mind, then you should
train yourself thus: ‘I will develop and cultivate the liberation of
mind by lovingkindness, make it my vehicle, make it my basis,
stabilize it, become proficient in it, and fully perfect it.’ Thus
should you train yourself.</p>
<p>When this concentration has been developed and cultivated by you, then
you should develop the concentration which has both applied and
sustained thought, or which is without applied thought and has only
sustained thought, or which is without both applied and sustained
thought, or which has rapture, or which is without rapture, or which
is accompanied by great happiness, or which is accompanied by
equanimity....<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn39">39</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. IV. 299-300.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The commentaries explain that the state described in the first passage
above, in which the mind is firmly established and well-composed, and
evil, unwholesome states cannot overwhelm the mind, is ‘basic
concentration’. The mind sustains attention on a single object and is
independent. The second passage describes the cultivation and
strengthening of this basic concentration, through the practice of
lovingkindness meditation.</p>
<p>The commentaries compare basic concentration to a fire that has been
ignited by rubbing two sticks together or by using a flint; and they
compare the cultivation of this basic concentration, say by developing
lovingkindness, to adding fuel or kindling to this fire so that it
blazes further. The third passage describes the increased cultivation of
basic or momentary concentration so that it becomes ‘attainment
concentration’ (passing over access concentration) at the level of
jhāna, by focusing on another meditation object, for example one of the
ten <em>kasiṇa</em> objects.</p>
<p>Another example is the Buddha’s description of his own efforts in
meditation: {782}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>As I abided thus, diligent, ardent, and resolute, a thought of
renunciation arose in me... a thought of non-ill-will arose in me... a
thought of non-cruelty arose in me. I understood thus: ‘This thought
of renunciation... this thought of non-ill-will... this thought of
non-cruelty has arisen in me. This kind of thought does not lead to my
own affliction, or to others’ affliction, or to the affliction of
both; it aids wisdom, does not cause difficulties, and leads to
Nibbāna. If I think and contemplate upon this thought even for a
night, even for a day, even for a night and a day, I see no danger
that may result from it. But with excessive thinking and contemplation
the body will become tired, and when the body is tired, the mind is
disturbed, and when the mind is disturbed, it is far from
concentration.’ So I steadied my mind internally, quietened it,
brought it to one-pointedness, and concentrated it. Why is that? So
that my mind should not be disturbed....</p>
<p>Tireless energy was aroused in me and unremitting mindfulness was
established, my body was relaxed and untroubled, my mind concentrated
and unified.</p>
<p>Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome
states, I entered upon and abided in the first jhāna....<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn40">40</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. I. 115-17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The commentaries explain that the phrase, ‘to steady the mind
internally, quieten it, bring it to one-pointedness, and concentrate
it’, and the phrase, ‘the mind concentrated and unified’, both refer to
‘basic concentration’ (i.e. to ‘momentary concentration’), which exists
prior to the arising of attainment concentration in jhāna, as described
by the final line of this passage.</p>
<p>The commentaries also offer examples for ‘preparatory concentration’
(<em>parikamma-samādhi</em>), such as a person who develops the ‘divine ear’
(<em>dibba-sota</em>): when this person exits from jhāna, he focuses attention
on various sounds, beginning with loud, distant sounds, like the roar of
a tiger, the rumbling of a wagon, or the blare of a horn. He then
gradually focuses on less conspicuous sounds, say of a drum, a gong, the
sound of music, the sound of chanting, the sound of two people
conversing, the sound of birds chirping, the sound of the wind, or the
sound of rustling leaves. Ordinary people can hear these sounds, but
someone with ‘preparatory’ or ‘momentary’ concentration will hear these
sounds much more clearly and distinctly. Momentary concentration should
be understood according to these explanations.</p>
<p>Some texts add ‘insight concentration’ (<em>vipassanā-samādhi</em>) to the
list, inserting it between momentary concentration and access
concentration.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup> Insight concentration is momentary concentration
which has been applied in the development of insight and which is
refined through this form of meditation. {783}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#adversaries-to-concentration" id="adversaries-to-concentration">Adversaries to Concentration</a></h3>
<p>The following qualities stand in opposition to concentration. They must
be eliminated in order for concentration to arise, or one can say that
they must be eliminated by concentration.</p>
<p>These factors have the special Pali name <em>nīvaraṇa</em>, which is translated
as ‘hindrance’ or ‘obstacle’. Technically speaking, they are things
which hinder the functioning of the mind, obstruct the goodness of the
mind, and sap the strength from wisdom. They are negative, unwholesome
qualities that prevent the development of virtue and sully the mind.</p>
<p>The Buddha described the five hindrances in the following ways:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>These five qualities, monks, are obstructions [to wholesome states],
hindrances [to spiritual growth]; they constrict the mind and weaken
wisdom.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 96.</em></p>
<p>[These five hindrances] are impurities of the mind, weakeners of
wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn42">42</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 94.</em></p>
<p>These five qualities are hindrances, makers of blindness, causing lack
of vision, causing lack of knowledge, detrimental to wisdom,
increasing distress, not conducive to Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn43">43</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 97.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>It is important to recognize these hindrances when they arise and not to
confuse them with tranquillity (<em>samatha</em>) or with concentration
(<em>samādhi</em>). The five hindrances are as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn44">44</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Kāma-chanda</em>: the desire to obtain; the desire to acquire;
literally, ‘delight in sense pleasures’; covetousness (<em>abhijjhā</em>);
a desire for the five objects of sensual enjoyment (<em>kāma-guṇa</em>):
sights, sounds, odours, tastes, and tangible objects, which are
pleasurable, delightful, alluring. <em>Kāma-chanda</em> is a defilement
related to greed. When the mind is captivated by sense objects,
caught up in desires and attachments, easily distracted and
preoccupied by sense impressions, it will not become firmly
established, composed, and concentrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Byāpāda</em>: anger and resentment; indignation, hatred, ill-will,
spite, and malevolence; seeing others as adversaries; irritation,
peevishness, aversion, and displeasure. When the mind is continually
in conflict and disturbed, unbalanced and lacking fluency, it will
not become concentrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Thīna-middha</em>: despondency and drowsiness; sloth and torpor;
boredom and apathy. This hindrance is separated into two
sub-factors: <em>thīna</em> – despondency, dejection, discouragement,
dispiritedness, and listlessness, which are symptoms of the mind;
and <em>middha</em> – drowsiness, inertia, sleepiness, doziness,
sluggishness, and dullness, which are symptoms of the body.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn45">45</a></sup> The
mind overcome by these mental and physical symptoms is weak,
constricted, and not suited for application; it thus will not become
concentrated. {784}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Uddhacca-kukkucca</em>: restlessness and worry. This hindrance too is
separated into two sub-factors: <em>uddhacca</em> – mental restlessness,
agitation, vacillation, confusion, and turbulence; and <em>kukkucca</em> –
mental anxiety, distress, disturbance, turmoil, and worry. The mind
overcome by these factors is restless and drifts aimlessly; it is
not peaceful and does not become concentrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vicikicchā</em>: doubt: uncertainty and scepticism about the Buddha,
the Dhamma, the Sangha, or about the spiritual training; doubt and
scepticism about wholesome qualities; an inability to determine
whether a specific quality (or a specific kind of meditation, etc.)
is valuable, worthy of practice, or effective. There is
equivocation, hesitation, and indecision. The mind, obstructed,
disturbed, and confused by such doubts, is unable to become
concentrated.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="header" href="#attributes-of-a-concentrated-mind" id="attributes-of-a-concentrated-mind">Attributes of a Concentrated Mind</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the purpose of training in higher mind
(<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>) is to generate and increase the quality and
capability of the mind. Concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), which is the aim of
such training, refers to a state of mind with an optimal capability and
efficiency. A concentrated mind has the following crucial attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is strong and powerful. This quality is compared to a strong
current of water which is guided through a single channel; it will
have far greater pressure than if left to disperse in all
directions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is profoundly tranquil and peaceful. The mind is like a still
lake; no wind rustles its surface and nothing churns the water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is clear and pristine; things in the mind can be seen clearly.
This is like a still body of water, not streaked by waves, in which
any remaining dust has settled to the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is malleable, adept, and well-suited for the work of insight,
because it is free from stress, rigidity, disturbance, confusion,
agitation, and anxiety.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned above, one synonym for <em>samādhi</em> is <em>ekaggatā</em>, which is
sometimes translated as a ‘focus on a single object’. But if we look at
the literal meaning of this word – as <em>eka</em> + <em>agga</em> + <em>tā</em> – we see
an attribute of the mind that is similar to that described in item #1
above (of mental strength). Although the commentators translate the term
<em>agga</em> here as ‘object of awareness’ (<em>ārammaṇa</em>), the original meaning
of this term is ‘point’, ‘tip’, or ‘summit’. According to this meaning,
a concentrated mind is sharp and ‘one-pointed’; it can easily pierce and
penetrate things and can easily become absorbed in something.</p>
<p>The commentaries say that complete concentration, especially the
concentration of jhāna, is fully endowed with eight qualities
(<em>aṭṭhaṅgasamannāgata-citta</em>), which they derive from various teachings
by the Buddha. These eight qualities are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Steadfastness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brightness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom from defilement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Malleability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dexterity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom from distraction and vacillation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The commentaries add that a mind endowed with these qualities is best
suited for spiritual practice, whether it be the practice of applying
wisdom in order to gain clear insight and understanding, or the practice
of developing mental power in order to gain higher psychic
attainments.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn46">46</a></sup> {785}</p>
<p>The most outstanding attribute of a concentrated mind, which is
connected to the true objective of developing concentration, is
dexterity – a readiness and suitability for work and for application.
According to the Buddhist teachings the most legitimate or appropriate
work is in the area of wisdom. One applies this state of mental
readiness and dexterity to create a suitable arena of practice, in order
to contemplate reality and to give rise to true realization. And here it
should be stressed that right concentration is not a state free from
feeling and awareness – a vanishing into some altered state of
consciousness – but rather it is a state of mental brightness,
spaciousness, independence, wakefulness, and joy – a freedom from
obscuring, oppressive, and obstructive qualities, and a readiness to
apply wisdom.</p>
<p>Consider the following teachings by the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, these five things are obstructions and hindrances; they
overwhelm the mind and weaken wisdom. These five things are sensual
desire ... ill-will ... sloth &amp; torpor ... restlessness &amp; worry ...
and doubt. When a monk has not abandoned these five obstacles,
hindrances that overwhelm the mind and weaken wisdom, when his wisdom
is weak and ineffective, for him to understand what is for his own
benefit, to understand what is for the benefit of others, to
understand what is for the benefit of both, or to realize a superhuman
distinction in knowledge and vision conducive to being a noble one:
that is impossible.</p>
<p>Suppose there were a river flowing down from the mountains – winding
far, its current swift, carrying everything with it – and a man would
open channels leading away from it on both sides, so that the current
in the middle of the river would be dispersed, diffused, and
dissipated; it would not travel far, its current would not be swift,
and it would not carry everything with it.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn47">47</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. III. 63-4.</em></p>
<p>The Brahman Saṅgārava approached the Blessed One and said to him:
‘Master Gotama, what is the cause and reason why sometimes even those
sacred hymns that have been recited over a long period do not become
clear to the mind, let alone those that have not been recited? What is
the cause and reason why sometimes those hymns that have not been
recited over a long period become clear to the mind, let alone those
that have been recited?’</p>
<p>The Buddha replied: ‘Brahman, when one dwells with a mind besieged by
sensual lust, overwhelmed by sensual lust, and one does not understand
as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust, on that occasion
one neither knows nor sees as it really is one’s own good, or the good
of others, or the good of both. Then even those hymns that have been
recited over a long period do not become clear to the mind, let alone
those that have not been recited.’</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>(This is the same for one who is besieged by ill-will, sloth &amp; torpor,
restlessness &amp; worry, and doubt.) The Buddha goes on to mention five
similes for the mind overwhelmed by the five hindrances: {786}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>The mind overwhelmed by sensual lust</em> is like a bowl of water
mixed with lac, turmeric, green dye, or red dye. If a man with
good sight were to examine his own reflection in it, he would
neither know nor see it as it really is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The mind overwhelmed by ill-will</em> is like a bowl of water heated
over a fire, bubbling and steaming. If a man with good sight were
to examine his own reflection in it, he would neither know nor see
it as it really is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The mind overwhelmed by sloth &amp; torpor</em> is like a bowl of water
covered over by water plants and algae. If a man with good sight
were to examine his own reflection in it, he would neither know
nor see it as it really is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The mind overwhelmed by restlessness &amp; worry</em> is like a bowl of
water stirred by the wind, quivering, rippling, churned into
wavelets. If a man with good sight were to examine his own
reflection in it, he would neither know nor see it as it really
is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The mind overwhelmed by doubt</em> is like a bowl of water that is
turbid, unsettled, muddy, placed in the dark. If a man with good
sight were to examine his own reflection in it, he would neither
know nor see it as it really is.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>‘When one dwells with a mind that is not besieged by sensual lust ...
and one understands as it really is the escape from arisen sensual
lust, on that occasion one knows and sees as it really is one’s own
good, and the good of others, and the good of both. Then even those
hymns that have not been recited over a long period become clear to
the mind, let alone those that have been recited.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn48">48</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 121-6; A. III. 230.</em></p>
<p>Monks, there are these five corruptions of gold, corrupted by which
gold is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant, but brittle and not
properly fit for work. What five? Iron, copper, tin, lead, and
silver.... But when gold is free of these five corruptions, it is
pliable, wieldy, radiant, not brittle, and properly fit for work.
Whichever ornament a goldsmith desires to make, whether it be a ring,
an earring, a necklace, or a gold chain, it can be successfully used
for that.</p>
<p>So too, there are these five corruptions of the mind, corrupted by
which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant, but weak
and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. What
five? Sensual desire, ill-will, sloth &amp; torpor, restlessness &amp; worry,
and doubt.... But when the mind is free of these five corruptions, it
is pliable, wieldy, radiant, not fragile, and rightly concentrated for
the destruction of the taints. Furthermore, when you incline your mind
towards the realization of whichever things there are to be realized
through direct knowledge, you attain the ability to witness these
things, there being a suitable basis. {787}</p>
<p><em>A. III. 16-17; cf.: S. V. 92.</em></p>
<p>If a monk is free from the five hindrances and makes tireless effort,
possesses unremitting mindfulness, with body calm and at ease, his
mind concentrated and unified, irrespective of whether he is walking,
standing, sitting, or lying down, he is called energetic and endowed
with a fear of wrongdoing (ottappa). He makes resolute and consistent
effort, and devotes himself in a determined manner.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn49">49</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. II. 14-15; It. 118-19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the commentaries offer these interesting
analogies: concentration causes the mind to be established on an object
in a steady, consistent way, and brings about an integration of
associated spiritual factors – they are not dispersed and dissipated –
like water which binds flour into a single mass of dough. Similarly,
concentration causes the mental processes to be composed and steadfast,
like a candle flame in a still room: the flame is unswerving, constant,
and uniformly bright.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn50">50</a></sup></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#general-objectives-and-benefits-of-concentration" id="general-objectives-and-benefits-of-concentration">General Objectives and Benefits of Concentration</a></h3>
<p>As has been emphasized above, the aim of correct or ‘right’ (<em>sammā</em>)
concentration is to prepare the mind for the successful application of
wisdom. Put simply, the purpose of concentration is to assist wisdom, as
explained in the following sutta passages:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Concentration is for the goal of knowing and seeing the truth.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn51">51</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Vin. V. 164.</em></p>
<p>The objective and reward of concentration is knowledge and vision of
things as they really are.</p>
<p><em>A. V. 1-2.</em></p>
<p>Purification of mind is for the sake of reaching purification of view.
(The development of concentration to purify the mind is for the sake
of purification of knowledge and discernment.)</p>
<p><em>M. I. 149.</em></p>
<p>Concentration, when imbued with morality, has great rewards and
blessings. Wisdom, when imbued with concentration, has great rewards
and blessings. The mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free
from the taints, that is from the taint of sense desire, the taint of
becoming, and the taint of ignorance.</p>
<p><em>D. II. 84.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Apart from these objectives mentioned above, the practice of
concentration has further benefits. Some of these benefits are
by-products resulting from developing concentration in order to reach
the goal of wisdom. Others are exceptional benefits which require
special forms of training. And still others assist those individuals who
have already attained the final goal of concentration. {788}</p>
<p>The benefits of concentration can be classified as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The final goal or ideal: in Buddhism the true goal of concentration
– with concentration being an essential factor of realizing this
goal – is freedom from all suffering and mental impurity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The precise benefit here of concentration is to prepare the mind
for wisdom, in order to reflect on and gain insight into the
true nature of reality; concentration acts as a foundation for
wisdom. In other words, concentration leads to ‘knowledge and
vision of things as they really are’ (<em>yathābhūta-ñāṇadassana</em>),
which in turn leads to true knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>) and liberation
(<em>vimutti</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although not considered the true goal of concentration practice,
a subsidiary benefit is the attainment of temporary states of
liberation, that is, ‘revocable’ deliverance of mind
(<em>cetovimutti</em>). This is a liberation from mental defilement
through the power of the mind, especially through the power of
jhāna. The defilements are suppressed or checked by the strength
of concentration for the duration of these concentrated states.
Technically, this liberation is referred to as ‘liberation by
suppression’ (<em>vikkhambhana-vimutti</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of exceptional psychic abilities: the benefits of
higher psychic attainments (<em>abhiññā</em>); the use of concentrative
attainments (<em>jhāna-samāpatti</em>) to generate psychic powers and other
mundane psychic attainments, like the ‘divine ear’, clairvoyance,
telepathy, and recollection of past lives, which are sometimes
referred to as extrasensory perception (ESP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits to mental health and to a healthy personality:
concentration has positive effects on a person’s mind and
disposition; it induces such qualities as inner strength,
decisiveness, vigour, resilience, tranquillity, cool-headedness,
joy, lovingkindness, compassion, and wise discernment. This is in
contrast to a people overcome by the hindrances, who tend to be
thinskinned, rude, irascible, aggressive, agitated, easily
infatuated, hasty, intrusive, suspicious, lethargic, depressed, and
indecisive.</p>
<p>Concentration prepares the mind for the development of other
spiritual qualities and for the cultivation of good habits. A person
with concentration knows how to calm the mind and to both control
and ease any mental suffering. One is able to keep one’s emotions in
check and one has a strong mental immune system. These advantages
increase when one applies concentration as a basis for the practice
of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, by mindfully paying
attention to one’s words and deeds, and to one’s emotions and
thoughts. One determines to use this knowledge only for beneficial
purposes and to prevent any danger or harm to arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefits to everyday life:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Concentration brings about mental relaxation, inner peace, and
happiness; it reduces stress, anxiety, and depression, and it
also relaxes the body. One can practise mindfulness of
breathing, say while waiting for the next activity to begin,
while stuck in traffic, or as a break from taxing mental work.
{789} This benefit in its complete form refers to the
concentrative attainment used by the Buddha and the arahants for
resting the mind and body, to be at ease during periods free
from other activities. This form of concentration is given the
special term ‘abiding at ease in the present’
(<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concentration enhances a person’s capability in work, study, and
all forms of activity. A concentrated mind one-pointed on an
activity – not disturbed, distracted, or forgetful – leads to
successful work, study, and contemplation. A person works with
circumspection and is careful to prevent mishaps. This is
because concentration is usually combined with the guiding
factor of mindfulness; the mind is dextrous (<em>kammanīya</em>) – it
is ready and suitable for work. If combined with the benefits
mentioned in #1 above (of mental relaxation, etc.), the success
of one’s activities will be even more greatly enhanced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concentration promotes physical health and aids in curing
illness. The mind and body are interdependent and have a bearing
on one another. When ordinary people have a physical illness,
their mind too tends to become weak and depressed; and when a
person is discouraged, the illness often gets worse. Even when
the body is healthy, if people encounter an intensely upsetting
situation they may fall ill. On the other hand, when those
individuals whose minds are strong (especially those persons who
are liberated) have a physical illness, only the body is unwell;
the mind remains at ease. Moreover, such persons can use this
strong and contented mind to alleviate the symptoms, reduce the
severity of the illness, and facilitate the healing process.
They can also use the power of concentration to reduce physical
pain.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>When the mind is bright and joyous, the body tends to be at ease
and healthy; a joyful mind boosts the immune system. This
relationship also has a bearing on the body’s physical needs and
metabolism. When the mind is happy and at ease, less food is
required for the body to be healthy. For example, a person who
is delighted by something often feels no hunger, or a monk who
has a realization of truth is nourished by bliss (<em>pīti</em>);
although he eats only one meal a day his complexion is bright,
because he does not hanker after the past or fantasize over the
future.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn53">53</a></sup> The converse is also true: many physical illnesses
are psychosomatic and are caused by mental imbalance. Anger and
anxiety, for example, can be a source of headaches and stomach
ulcers. Developing wholesome mind states helps in curing these
illnesses. This benefit of enhancing physical health is brought
to perfection when wisdom is also engaged.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn54">54</a></sup> {790}</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#aims-and-benefits-of-different-kinds-of-concentrative-meditation" id="aims-and-benefits-of-different-kinds-of-concentrative-meditation">Aims and Benefits of Different Kinds of Concentrative Meditation</a></h3>
<p>The Pali Canon contains this summary of the aims of concentration:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these four developments of concentration:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The development of concentration, cultivated and deepened, that is
conducive to dwelling happily in the present
(diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of concentration, cultivated and deepened, that is
conducive to knowledge and vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of concentration, cultivated and deepened, that is
conducive to mindfulness and clear comprehension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of concentration, cultivated and deepened, that is
conducive to the end of all mental taints.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>A. II. 44-5; D. III. 222-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Development #1</strong>: the Pali Canon explains this as the four jhānas.
This refers to developing the jhānas as one way of experiencing
happiness, corresponding to the teaching on the ten levels of
happiness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn55">55</a></sup> From coarse to refined, these levels are: sensual
pleasure, bliss in the four stages of fine-material jhāna, bliss in the
four stages of immaterial jhāna, and bliss in the ‘attainment of
cessation’ (<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>). The Buddha and the arahants develop
the jhānas when they are not engaged in other activities, for ease and
relaxation (’abiding at ease in the present’ –
<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Development #2</strong>: the Pali Canon explains this as the meditation on
the perception of light (<em>āloka-saññā</em>), by establishing the perception
‘it is day’ (<em>divā-saññā</em>), irrespective of whether it is day or night,
with a bright, spacious mind, unencumbered by the hindrances. The
commentaries say that ‘knowledge and vision’ (<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>) here
refers to the divine eye, which they claim is the apex of the five
mundane higher psychic attainments.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn56">56</a></sup> In some places the commentaries
claim that the single word <em>ñāṇa-dassana</em> refers to all of the five
mundane higher psychic attainments. This benefit thus refers to the
application of concentration in order to generate special psychic
attainments and powers.</p>
<p><strong>Development #3</strong>: paying attention to and thoroughly knowing thoughts
and feelings which arise and pass away in one’s daily life; the Pali
Canon explains this as knowing clearly the sensations (<em>vedanā</em>),
perceptions (<em>saññā</em>), and thoughts (<em>vitakka</em>), which arise, are
established, and pass away.</p>
<p><strong>Development #4:</strong> the Pali Canon explains this as the possession of
wisdom, of constantly discerning the rising and ceasing of the ‘five
aggregates of clinging’; to reflect in the following ways: the body is
this way, the arising of the body is this way, the decline of the body
is this way (similarly with feeling, perception, volitional formations,
and consciousness). Generally speaking, this refers to applying
concentration to assist wisdom, to act as a support or a foundation for
the development of insight, in order to realize the supreme goal:
knowledge of the destruction of the taints – knowledge of
liberation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the commentaries the first and second developments pertain
to tranquillity (<em>samatha</em>), while the third and fourth developments
pertain to insight (<em>vipassanā</em>). {791} Although not specifically
mentioned in this canonical passage, the other benefits of concentration
mentioned earlier are obtained while developing these four ways of
concentration.</p>
<p>The commentaries provide a similar summary of the benefits of developing
concentration. The Visuddhimagga outlines five such benefits:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn58">58</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A means of resting at ease in the present
(<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>): this is a benefit of ‘attainment
concentration’ (<em>appanā</em>, i.e. of jhāna) experienced by arahants,
who have completed all necessary tasks for liberation and who do not
need to use jhāna for achieving specific states of realization.
Here, the commentaries cite the Buddha’s words: <em>These jhānas are
called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the noble ones’
discipline</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn59">59</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A basis or proximate cause (<em>padaṭṭhāna</em>) for insight: this is a
benefit of attainment concentration, or even of ‘access
concentration’, but this degree of concentration is not
exceptionally bright or spacious; it is experienced both by a
‘person in training’ (<em>sekha</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn60">60</a></sup> and by ordinary people. Here,
the commentaries cite the Buddha’s teaching: <em>Bhikkhus, develop
concentration. A bhikkhu who is concentrated understands things as
they really are</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn61">61</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A basis or proximate cause for higher psychic attainments
(<em>abhiññā</em>): this is a benefit of attainment concentration
experienced by a person who has obtained the eight ‘concentrative
attainments’ (<em>samāpatti</em>); such a person can generate the higher
psychic attainments as desired. Here, the commentaries cite the
Buddha’s teaching: <em>The mind is pliable, wieldy ... when he inclines
his mind towards the realization of whichever things there are to be
realized through direct knowledge, he attains the ability to witness
these things, there being a suitable basis</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn62">62</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ability to reach exceptional planes of existence; a person is
born in fortunate and lofty realms of existence. This is a benefit
of attainment concentration experienced by an unawakened person who
has attained and not fallen away from jhāna; such a person is reborn
in the Brahma realm. Here, the commentaries cite the teaching:
<em>Having developed the first jhāna to a limited degree
(paritta-kusala), where is a person reborn? He joins the divine
company of Brahma’s retinue.</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn63">63</a></sup> Even access concentration can
lead to the higher realms of the six sense-sphere heavens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An ability to enter the ‘attainment of cessation’
(<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>): this is a merit of attainment concentration
experienced by an arahant or a non-returner who has reached the
eight ‘concentrative attainments’; such a person can experience
bliss in a state free from perception and feeling for up to seven
days. Here, the commentaries cite the teaching in the
Paṭisambhidāmagga on knowledge connected to the attainment of
cessation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn64">64</a></sup> {792}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="header" href="#preventing-misunderstandings-about-the-aims-and-benefits-of-concentration" id="preventing-misunderstandings-about-the-aims-and-benefits-of-concentration">Preventing Misunderstandings about the Aims and Benefits of Concentration</a></h3>
<p>An understanding of the benefits and objectives of concentration helps
to prevent and dispel misunderstandings about the proper role of
concentration in Buddhism and about the life of the monastic community.
Such misunderstandings include the belief that meditation is a matter of
retreat from the world and a disregard for social affairs, or the idea
that the life of a monk is one of total isolation and a disregard for
social responsibility. The following considerations may help to prevent
such misunderstandings:</p>
<p>Concentration is simply a means to an end; it is not the goal of
Buddhist spiritual practice. Beginning practitioners may separate
themselves from society in order to engage in a form of training for a
special, limited period of time, but later they return to take an active
role in society suitable to their circumstances. Moreover, the
development of concentration generally does not require sitting immobile
all day and night; there are many meditation techniques available to
choose from.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s teaching on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness reveals how
some people are able to realize arahantship after practising these
factors for only seven days. After this realization these awakened
individuals generally apply concentration for the benefit of dwelling at
ease in the present. They can dedicate the large remainder of their time
to live according to the Buddha’s original exhortation: ‘Bhikkhus,
wander forth for the welfare and happiness of the manyfolk, for the
compassionate assistance of the world’ (<em>caratha bhikkhave cārikaṃ
bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya lokānukampāya</em>).</p>
<p>The way of practice for an individual monk depends on suitability,
aptitude, personality traits, and interests. Some monks wish to live
alone in the forest and this is suitable for them; for others it is
inappropriate for them to live in the forest, even if they desire to do
so. There are examples in which the Buddha did not give his permission
for particular monks to practise on their own in the forest.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn65">65</a></sup> Even
if a monk lives in the forest, the monastic discipline forbids a monk
from cutting himself off entirely from social responsibilities in the
manner of a rishi or a hermit.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>In Buddha-Dhamma the desired benefit of concentration and of jhāna is a
state of mind that is ‘pliable and wieldy’, which is conducive to the
application of wisdom, as mentioned earlier. The other benefits obtained
from concentration and from jhāna are considered supplementary or
special, and they are sometimes even undesirable, in which case the
Buddha did not condone these. For example, a person who cultivates
concentration with the desire for psychic powers is deemed as
establishing wrong intention. Psychic powers can generate many ill
effects, are subject to decline, and are unable to lead to the
realization of the goal of Buddha-Dhamma.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn67">67</a></sup> {793} Having said this,
someone who practises for the purpose of wisdom, and who obtains psychic
powers through the development of concentration, is considered to
possess exceptional abilities.</p>
<p>In any case, even if a person develops concentration with the proper
objective, as long as he or she has not yet realized the true goal, the
acquisition of psychic powers will always be a danger.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn68">68</a></sup> This is
because these powers may cause infatuation and attachment, both for the
person who has these powers and for others, and because they can lead to
an increase of mental defilement and thus impede spiritual progress.
Although the Buddha possessed numerous psychic powers, he did not
encourage the use of such powers, because they are not the path of
wisdom and deliverance. From the Buddha’s life story we see that he used
psychic powers in certain situations in order to subdue psychic powers
or to subdue an attachment to such powers.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn69">69</a></sup></p>
<p>Those individuals who have progressed on the Path or who have reached
the goal tend to use concentration on the level of jhāna as a means for
abiding at ease in times free from activity. Although the Buddha
travelled around teaching many people, interacting with people at all
levels of society, and looked after the large monastic community, he
possessed the attributes of <em>jhāyī</em> and <em>jhāna-sīlī</em>: he was devoted to
jhāna; he was content to abide in jhāna instead of resting during his
spare time.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn70">70</a></sup> This is similarly the case for many of the Buddha’s
disciples: they used jhāna to dwell at ease in the present moment
(<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>). On one occasion the Buddha sought a place
of solitude for three months in order to abide in a state of
concentration.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn71">71</a></sup></p>
<p>The ability to find jhānic happiness to any degree is a form of
individual freedom. However, if the interest in jhāna leads to a neglect
for communal responsibilities, such conduct is blameworthy, even if the
fascination is to a refined level of consciousness. According to the
fundamental principles contained in the monastic discipline, the way of
life for the monks emphasizes the importance of communal responsibility.
The prosperity or the decline of the monastic sangha hinges on this
essential principle of communal responsibility. For the Buddha and for
those who practise correctly, concentration on the whole assists in
those activities aiming for the welfare of all beings. {794}</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#important-results-and-limitations-of-concentration" id="important-results-and-limitations-of-concentration">Important Results and Limitations of Concentration</a></h3>
<p>The development of concentration becomes increasingly refined. The state
of mind of a person who has reached attainment concentration
(<em>appanā-samādhi</em>) is referred to as jhāna (’absorption’), of which
there are many levels. The higher is the level of jhāna the fewer are
the remaining mental factors or attributes determining each level
(<em>jhānaṅga</em>). States of jhāna are generally classified into two main
groups, and each group is further divided into four sub-groups,
resulting in eight levels. These are referred to as the eight jhānas or
the eight concentrative attainments (<em>samāpatti</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Four fine-material jhānas (<em>rūpa-jhāna</em>):</p>
<div class="list-decimal">
<ol>
<li>
<p>First jhāna (<em>paṭhama-jhāna</em>): containing five factors: initial
application of thought (<em>vitakka</em>), sustained application of
thought (<em>vicāra</em>), bliss (<em>pīti</em>), joy (<em>sukha</em>), and
one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second jhāna (<em>dutiya-jhāna</em>): containing three factors: bliss
(<em>pīti</em>), joy (<em>sukha</em>), and one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third jhāna (<em>tatiya-jhāna</em>): containing two factors: joy
(<em>sukha</em>) and one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fourth jhāna (<em>catuttha-jhāna</em>): containing two factors:
equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>) and one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four formless jhānas (<em>arūpa-jhāna</em>):</p>
<div class="list-decimal">
<ol>
<li>
<p>Awareness of infinite space (<em>ākāsānañcāyatana</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awareness of infinite consciousness (<em>viññāṇañcāyatana</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awareness of the sphere of nothingness (<em>ākiñcaññāyatana</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enter the state of neither-perception-nor-non-perception
(<em>nevasaññānāsaññāyatana</em>), in which one ceases to focus on
anything at all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Abhidhamma, especially in the post-canonical sub-commentaries to
the Abhidhamma, the fine material jhānas are usually divided into five
levels.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn72">72</a></sup> These five are derived from the original group of four
jhānas: a new second jhāna is inserted between the original first and
second jhānas. This new jhāna contains four factors: sustained
application (<em>vicāra</em>), bliss (<em>pīti</em>), joy (<em>sukha</em>), and
one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>); in other words, it is a jhāna which has
sustained application of thought but no initial application. The
original second jhāna is shifted to the position of third jhāna, the
original third is shifted to fourth, and the fourth is shifted to fifth
jhāna, respectively. Students of Buddhism should therefore not be
confused or surprised when they encounter the terms <em>jhāna-pañcakanaya</em>,
<em>pañcakajjhāna</em>, and <em>pañcama-jhāna</em>. They should realize that this
group of five stems from the original group of four.</p>
<p>The scriptures refer to any method of determined effort for developing
concentration in order to generate these aforementioned attainments as
tranquillity meditation (<em>samatha</em>). The efforts by unawakened persons
to develop concentration can lead no further than to the eight
concentrative attainments mentioned above. The highest attainment
possible by way of tranquillity meditation is thus the state of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. {822}</p>
<p>Those individuals who have realized the fruits of both tranquillity and
insight meditation (<em>samatha</em> and <em>vipassanā</em>) – who are either
non-returners or arahants – are able to reach a ninth, supremely
refined state called ‘cessation of perception and feeling’
(<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>) or the ‘attainment of cessation’
(<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn73">73</a></sup></p>
<p>However vital concentration is for spiritual practice and for reaching
liberation, which is the final goal of Buddhism, its importance is
limited, as can be explained as follows:</p>
<p>The importance of concentration for the practice of liberation is
determined by the relationship between concentration and wisdom (that
is, to make the mind fit for work). Moreover, the concentration required
for the optimal functioning of wisdom does not need to be of the most
refined level. Although concentration may be developed to the highest
level of jhāna, if it is not integrated into the development of wisdom
there is absolutely no way for concentration alone to lead to the
highest goal of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Although the eight levels of jhāna are extremely refined states of mind,
if they are solely the results of tranquillity meditation they are still
mundane phenomena and should not be confused with the goal of Buddhism.</p>
<p>In states of jhāna resulting from tranquillity meditation, mental
defilements (<em>kilesa</em>) are allayed, and therefore these states are also
referred to as a form of liberation. This liberation, however, is only
temporary, existing for as long as a person remains in that state of
concentration. It is uncertain and subject to regression. The scriptures
thus refer to this form of liberation as ‘mundane liberation’
(<em>lokiya-vimokkha</em>), ‘unstable liberation’ (<em>kuppa-vimokkha</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn74">74</a></sup> and
‘liberation through suppression’ (<em>vikkhambhana-vimokkha</em>; defilements
are allayed through suppression by concentration, similar to placing a
stone on grass – when the stone is removed the grass can sprout
again).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn75">75</a></sup></p>
<p>From the preceding observations we can see that in Buddhist practice,
the crucial and decisive factor is wisdom. The wisdom used at this final
stage of practice is referred to specifically as ‘insight’
(<em>vipassanā</em>). Therefore, for spiritual practice to be truly effective
it must reach the stage of insight.</p>
<p>Concentration is a vital factor for making the mind fit for work, yet
there is some flexibility regarding this factor: one can apply different
levels of concentration, beginning with initial levels like
‘insight-concentration’ (<em>vipassanā-samādhi</em>; existing at the same level
as ‘momentary concentration’ – <em>khaṇika-samādhi</em>) or access
concentration (<em>upacāra-samādhi</em>).</p>
<p>Although one’s spiritual practice must be endowed with all eight factors
of the Eightfold Path in order to reach the highest goal of Buddhism, it
is possible to divide the specific methods of concentration applied in
this context into two main ways of practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The method of ‘one who uses insight as a vehicle’
(<em>vipassanā-yānika</em>): this method emphasizes mindfulness and was
referred to earlier in the section on right mindfulness. Here, only
an initial level of concentration is applied, just enough as is
necessary as an aide for practice. Mindfulness is the principal
factor, used for holding or binding the object of attention and as a
preparation for wisdom to then investigate it. Such a person is
sometimes referred to more specifically as ‘one who practises pure
insight as a vehicle’ (<em>suddhavipassanā-yānika</em>). Tranquillity
(<em>samatha</em>) plays a role here as well, but it is not emphasized.
{823}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method of ‘one who uses tranquillity as a vehicle’
(<em>samatha-yānika</em>): this method emphasizes concentration, which
plays the pivotal role. One develops concentration until the mind is
calm and unified, leading to states of absorption (<em>jhāna</em>) or to
concentrative attainments (<em>samāpatti</em>). The mind becomes absorbed
in and firmly established on the object of attention, to the point
that the mind is automatically primed to engage in activity: the
mind is malleable, ready, and optimally suited for a chosen task. In
such a state of mind the mental defilements and taints, which
normally disturb and afflict the mind, are temporarily stilled. This
is similar to silt which settles at the bottom of a pond when the
water is still; in such a case a person can see through the water
clearly. This state of mind is excellently suited for advancing to
the stage of applying wisdom, in which mental ‘sediment’ can be
eliminated completely. Methods of practice bringing about such
unification of mind are referred to as ‘tranquillity meditation’
(<em>samatha</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If one does not stop at the second method, one advances to the stage of
wisdom (of insight – <em>vipassanā</em>) in which mental defilements and
mental taints are completely removed. This is similar to method #1,
above, but technically the task is now easier, because the mind is
prepared. This method is thus complete, containing both calm (<em>samatha</em>)
and insight (<em>vipassanā</em>).</p>
<p>In reference to persons who are awakened through these two methods of
practice, a person who is awakened by following the first method is
called a <em>paññā-vimutta</em>: ‘one liberated (solely) through wisdom’.
Strictly speaking, such a person is called a ‘dry-insight practitioner’
(<em>sukkha-vipassaka</em>), whose concentration reaches the level of jhāna at
the moment of attaining the Path (<em>magga</em>). (Within the classification
of <em>paññā-vimutta</em>, a dry-insight practitioner is considered the lowest
or the last of such individuals.)</p>
<p>Someone awakened by the second method is called an
<em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>: ‘one liberated both ways’ (i.e. liberated by way
of concentrative attainments and liberated by way of the noble path –
<em>ariya-magga</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn76">76</a></sup></p>
<p>The second method, which utilizes the complete system of tranquillity
meditation before developing insight, and which leads to being liberated
‘both ways’, contains other important attributes:</p>
<p>A person who practises this method often obtains exceptional abilities
springing from concentrative attainments, especially the abilities
referred to as the six higher psychic attainments (<em>abhiññā</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn77">77</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Iddhividhā</em>: psychic powers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dibbasota</em>: ‘divine ear’; clairaudience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cetopariyañāṇa</em>: telepathy; mind-reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dibbacakkhu</em> (or <em>cutūpapāta-ñāṇa</em>): ‘divine eye’; clairvoyance;
knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings according to
their kamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pubbenivāsānussati</em>: recollection of past lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Āsavakkhaya-ñāṇa</em>: knowledge of the destruction of the taints
(<em>āsava</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A person who is awakened by way of the first method only obtains the
knowledge of the destruction of the taints, not the other higher psychic
attainments.</p>
<p>A person who practises the second method must complete both stages of
development. Although the practice of tranquillity leads to absorption
and higher concentrative attainments, if it does not advance to the
stage of insight, or is not combined with insight practice, it is
impossible for it to lead to the final goal of Buddhism. {824}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#supporting-factors-for-concentration" id="supporting-factors-for-concentration">Supporting Factors for Concentration</a></h3>
<p>Many factors are involved in the development of concentration. Some act
as a foundation for concentration to arise, while others act both as a
support for generating concentration and as an aid for bringing it to
completion and achieving higher goals, like the development of insight.</p>
<p>Some of these factors are found in numerous contexts, making them seem
redundant. Effort (<em>viriya</em>), for example, is a road to success
(<em>iddhi-pāda</em>), a spiritual power (<em>bala</em>), a spiritual faculty
(<em>indriya</em>), and an enlightenment factor (<em>bojjhaṅga</em>). One should
understand that these factors are classified in different groups
according to their properties and functions. For instance, effort is a
road to success in circumstances when it is the main thrust behind
accomplishing a particular deed. It is a spiritual power when it acts as
a protective force, preventing opposing qualities from overwhelming and
endangering the mind. It is a spiritual faculty when it ‘governs’
proceedings, acting to eliminate antagonistic, unwholesome qualities,
like laziness, discouragement, and indifference, and to generate a
readiness for action. It is an enlightenment factor when, in association
with other factors and in an interconnected process, it leads to
realization of the truth.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-basis-proximate-cause-and-goal-of-concentration" id="the-basis-proximate-cause-and-goal-of-concentration">The Basis, Proximate Cause, and Goal of Concentration</a></h3>
<p>Virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>) is the basis for concentration. As the first
step in the threefold training, it supports the arising of concentration
in the same way that it supports the whole of spiritual practice. This
is confirmed by the Buddha’s teaching which Ven. Buddhaghosa uses as an
opening quote to explain the gist of the Visuddhimagga in its entirety:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A learned monk, well-established in virtue, developing the mind and
wisdom, one who is ardent and sagacious: he can disentangle this
tangle.</p>
<p><em>Vism. 1; original quote at: S. I. 13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha said that a person well-established in moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>)
will succeed in spiritual practice, regardless of whether one labels
this practice as the Eightfold Path, the Seven Factors of Enlightenment,
the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, or the Four Right Efforts. This is
similar to how people rely on the earth as a foundation on which to
work, or to how all creatures depend on the earth for support while
standing, walking, sitting, and lying down.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn78">78</a></sup></p>
<p>Generally speaking, moral conduct refers to virtuous behaviour and to
refraining from causing harm or distress to anyone. Immoral conduct
creates affliction and turmoil for the doer, along with a lack of
self-confidence. It is a thorn which pierces the heart and prevents a
person from being completely peaceful. As for additional levels of moral
conduct, these depend on moral codes adopted by individuals to help
guide their lives. Bhikkhus, for example, practise according to the
principles of restraint contained in the Vinaya. Beyond moral conduct,
the prominent supporting forces in spiritual practice which the Buddha
mentioned frequently are heedfulness (<em>appamāda</em>), the presence of a
virtuous friend (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>), and wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn79">79</a></sup></p>
<p>Moral conduct acts as a foundation for concentration, but it bears fruit
indirectly or from a distance.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn80">80</a></sup> The commentators claim that the
true, immediate condition giving rise to concentration is happiness
(<em>sukha</em>), and they thus state that ‘happiness is the proximate cause
for concentration’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn81">81</a></sup> To prevent misunderstandings, note that states
of mind warranting the title of <em>samādhi</em>, must, at least at initial
stages, be accompanied by happiness.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, the objective of concentration is knowledge and
vision according to reality (<em>yathābhūta-ñāṇadassana</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn82">82</a></sup> As the
Buddha said: ‘A person with a concentrated mind knows and sees according
to the truth (<em>samāhito ... yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn83">83</a></sup> This means that
concentration is the ‘domain of practice’ for wisdom; it promotes the
development and fulfilment of wisdom. In any case, in regard to the
interconnectedness between factors of the Path, wisdom – ‘right view’
– is the compass needle or the provider of light, allowing the other
Path factors to progress in the right direction. Wisdom development thus
supports the development of concentration. For instance, the clearer is
one’s discernment of things, the greater is one’s confidence and the
more powerful one’s concentration. These two vital factors –
concentration and wisdom – are thus mutually supportive and
interdependent:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A person lacking in wisdom has no concentrative absorption.<br />
A person lacking in concentrative absorption has no wisdom.<br />
Indeed, a person possessing both concentrative absorption<br />
and wisdom abides close to Nibbāna.</p>
<p><em>Natthi jhānaṃ apaññassa; natthi paññā ajhāniyo; yamhi jhānañca
paññañca sa ve nibbānasantike.</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn84">84</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Dh. verse 372.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When describing a particular spiritual quality, the commentaries
generally explain it by examining various aspects, for example:
attribute (<em>lakkhaṇa</em>), function (<em>rasa</em>), appearance (<em>paccupaṭṭhāna</em>;
visible effects), and proximate cause (<em>padaṭṭhāna</em>). In this context
the commentators state that the attribute of concentration is
non-distraction, its function is the elimination of mental distraction
or the gathering together of accompanying factors (<em>sahajāta-dhamma</em>),
its visible effects are non-wavering, tranquillity, and knowledge
(<em>ñāṇa</em>) of the truth, and its proximate cause is happiness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn85">85</a></sup></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#accompanying-factors-of-concentration" id="accompanying-factors-of-concentration">Accompanying Factors of Concentration</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, firmly established concentration is called
attainment concentration (<em>appanā-samādhi</em>). When the mind attains this
level of concentration, it enters what is called ‘concentrative
absorption’ (<em>jhāna</em>). In jhāna, concentration (also referred to as
‘one-pointedness’ – <em>ekaggatā</em>) is always accompanied by a certain
number of accompanying factors. {826}</p>
<p>There are several levels of jhāna: four levels according to the original
suttas of the Pali Canon, or five levels according to the interpretation
of the Abhidhamma. The higher the level of jhāna the more refined it is.
As mentioned in an earlier section, the higher the level of refinement
the fewer are the accompanying factors. The regular accompanying factors
of jhāna, including the factor of concentration (<em>samādhi</em> or
<em>ekaggatā</em>), are called ‘jhāna factors’ (<em>jhānaṅga</em>). In total there are
six: initial mental application (<em>vitakka</em>), sustained mental
application (<em>vicāra</em>), rapture (<em>pīti</em>), happiness (<em>sukha</em>),
equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>), and one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-jhana-factors">Jhāna Factors</a>). A summary of these six factors is as
follows:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn86">86</a></sup></p>

factors as ‘mental absorption’ (<em>jhāna</em>). They also describe a

<ol>

<p>Second jhāna: <em>sampasāda</em> (’confidence’ – <em>saddhā</em>), <em>pīti</em>,
<em>sukha</em>, and <em>cittassa ekaggatā</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third jhāna: <em>upekkhā</em>, <em>sati</em> (mindfulness), <em>sampajañña</em> (clear
comprehension), <em>sukha</em>, and <em>cittassa ekaggatā</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fourth jhāna: <em>upekkhā</em>, <em>sati</em>, and <em>cittassa ekaggatā</em>. (Vbh.
257-8, 260-61.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, access concentration (<em>upacāra-samādhi</em>) also dispels the
five hindrances and contains the same five accompanying factors as the
first jhāna, but it has less power than attainment concentration
(Vism. 146-7). In some cases, access concentration contains equanimity
instead of mindfulness &amp; bliss; in such cases access concentration
contains four factors: <em>vitakka</em>, <em>vicāra</em>, <em>upekkhā</em>, and <em>ekaggatā</em>
(Vism. 85-6).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Initial mental application (<em>vitakka</em>): ‘thinking’; to fix one’s
mind on an object; to set one’s attention to an object. This factor
is present in the first jhāna.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Sustained mental application (<em>vicāra</em>): ‘reflection’; to embrace,
sustain, and be immersed in an object of attention. This factor is
present in the first jhāna (and in the second jhāna according to the
five jhānas of the Abhidhamma).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These two factors, of fixing and sustaining attention, are linked. This
is similar to a person who polishes a tarnished bronze vessel: <em>vitakka</em>
is like the hand which grasps the vessel, <em>vicāra</em> is like the hand
holding a brush and polishing the vessel. Another simile is to a potter:
<em>vitakka</em> is like the hand which presses down on the clay, <em>vicāra</em> is
like the hand which moulds the pot.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Bliss (<em>pīti</em>): delight; rapture; contentment. Here, this term
refers specifically to bliss permeating the entire body; it is also
called all-pervasive rapture (<em>pharaṇā-pīti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn87">87</a></sup> Bliss is present
in the first and second jhānas (and in jhānas one, two, and three of
the group of five jhānas).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Happiness (<em>sukha</em>): joy; refreshment; ease; an absence of all
mental distress and agitation. This factor is present in the first
three levels of jhāna (or the first four levels in the group of
five).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The distinction between bliss and happiness can cause confusion for some
people. <em>Pīti</em> here refers to the delight in acquiring a desired sense
object. <em>Sukha</em>, on the other hand, refers to the pleasure of
experiencing this sense object. {827} Take for example a person
wandering in a desert, hot, thirsty, and exhausted. He discovers an
oasis surrounded by shady trees, or he meets someone who tells him that
such an oasis lies nearby. He then goes to this oasis, drinks, and rests
to his heart’s content. The delight in seeing or hearing of the oasis is
called <em>pīti</em>, while the satisfaction of drinking and finding relief is
<em>sukha</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.</strong> Equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>): detachment; looking on with dispassion; to
observe phenomena peacefully; to observe arising phenomena without
falling into partisanship. In the case of jhāna, this means to not
be attached even to the exceptional pleasure of jhāna. On a higher
level, <em>upekkhā</em> refers to an equanimity when everything falls into
place or reaches completion. One no longer busily searches for
results. Especially in the case of the fourth jhāna, which is
completely free of harmful mental qualities, one needs not make the
effort to eliminate these qualities. This factor is specific to the
fourth jhāna (the fifth jhāna in the group of five).</li>
</ul>
<p>Equanimity, in fact, exists at all stages of jhāna, but it is not
pronounced in the early stages. It is still suppressed by unfavourable
factors like initial mental application, sustained application, and
feelings of pleasure. This is similar to the moon during the daytime: it
is not clear and bright because of the dominant light of the sun. In the
fourth jhāna the unfavourable factors are stilled and one enters
‘night-time’: one is supported by neutral feelings (<em>upekkhā-vedanā</em>, or
<em>adukkhamasukha-vedanā</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-upekkha-factor">Two Forms of Upekkhā</a>) Equanimity is pure, clear and bright,
and it purifies and brightens accompanying factors like mindfulness.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>6.</strong> One-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>): one-pointed attention; this is
precisely the factor of concentration (<em>samādhi</em>). It is present at
all levels of jhāna.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>One thing that needs to be reiterated is that although the so-called
jhāna factors are constant to specific levels of jhāna and help to
distinguish which level of jhāna has been reached, this does not mean
that these are the only factors present in jhāna. Although they are not
used to distinguish various levels of jhāna, many other accompanying
factors (<em>sampayutta-dhamma</em>) exist, like perception (<em>saññā</em>),
intention (<em>cetanā</em>), enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>), effort (<em>viriya</em>),
mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), and reflection (<em>manasikāra</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn88">88</a></sup> Some of these
factors always accompany states of jhāna while some are occasionally in
attendance.</p>
<p>The descriptions in the Sutta Piṭaka of different stages of jhāna often
emphasize distinctive factors. For example, in the context of the third
jhāna, mindfulness and clear comprehension are emphasized; although
these factors are present in the first two jhānas, their role is more
pronounced in the third jhāna. And in the fourth jhāna an emphasis is
made on the clarity and purity of mindfulness, which is supported by
pure equanimity; accompanying factors likewise are sharpened by
equanimity.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn89">89</a></sup> This material here helps to prevent the
misunderstanding that jhāna is a state of non-awareness, a form of
trance, a fading away or absorption into some other reality. {828}</p>
<p>The Visuddhimagga cites the Peṭakopadesa, which states that the five
jhāna factors arising along with attainment concentration and the
realization of the first jhāna are adversaries to the five hindrances,
resulting in five pairs of opposing qualities: initial mental
application is the foe of sloth &amp; torpor; sustained mental application
is the foe of doubt; bliss is the foe of ill-will; happiness is the foe
of restlessness &amp; worry; and concentration or one-pointedness is the foe
of sensual desire.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn90">90</a></sup> When these jhāna factors arise they dispel the
five hindrances, and when they are present they prevent the hindrances
from resurfacing. On the contrary, if the five hindrances exercise
influence over the mind the jhāna factors cannot function. In any case,
according to the Buddha, the seven factors of enlightenment
(<em>bojjhaṅga</em>) are the direct adversaries to the five hindrances, a
subject which will be discussed below.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Two Forms of Upekkhā</span><a id="note-upekkha-factor"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To prevent confusion, note the difference between:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>upekkhā</em> as a jhāna factor, which is translated as ‘equanimity’
and is a wholesome quality classified within the aggregate of
volitional formations (<em>saṅkhāra-khandha</em>), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>upekkhā</em> as a feeling (<em>vedanā</em>), which is a neutral feeling or a
feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain (<em>adukkhamasukha-vedanā</em>),
and is neither wholesome nor unwholesome.</p>

</ul>
<p>In the fourth jhāna equanimity as a jhāna factor is accompanied by
neutral sensations – both of these kinds of <em>upekkhā</em> are present.</p>

</div>
<h3><a class="header" href="#criteria-for-preparedness" id="criteria-for-preparedness">Criteria for Preparedness</a></h3>
<p>The five spiritual faculties (<em>indriya</em>) are the criteria for
determining a person’s spiritual readiness and for indicating the rate
of a person’s spiritual development, namely: faith (<em>saddhā</em>), effort
(<em>viriya</em>), mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and wisdom
(<em>paññā</em>). These criteria are used for the whole of spiritual practice,
not just in the context of meditation.</p>
<p>The term <em>indriya</em> refers to the governing factor or principal agent in
a specific activity. In this context it refers to the governing factor
in the elimination of unwholesome, opposing qualities. Effort, for
example, eliminates laziness and leads to a preparedness for spiritual
engagement. The scriptural definitions for the five faculties can be
summarized as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn91">91</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Faculty of faith (<em>saddhā</em>; <em>saddhindriya</em>): as seen in the teaching
on the four factors of stream-entry (<em>sotāpattiyaṅga</em>), this faculty
essentially refers to faith in the Buddha’s awakening
(<em>tathāgatabodhi-saddhā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn92">92</a></sup> The function of faith is intent
devotion and determination (<em>adhimokkha</em>). A common definition for
the faculty of faith is ‘rational belief and a confidence in the
truth and goodness of something one honours and practises’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faculty of effort (or ‘energy’; <em>viriya</em>; <em>viriyindriya</em>): this
faculty is described in the teaching on the four right efforts
(<em>sammappadhāna</em>). In some places it is defined as the effort
derived from engaging in the four right efforts, or as equivalent to
the four right efforts. In other places it is defined as the effort
to abandon unwholesome qualities and to bring wholesome qualities to
completion, as diligence, courage and perseverance, and as not
neglecting wholesome actions. The function of effort is to support
and ‘lift up’ (<em>paggaha</em>) the mind. A common definition for the
faculty of effort is ‘determination, vitality, and
non-discouragement’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faculty of mindfulness (<em>sati</em>; <em>satindriya</em>): this faculty is
described in the teaching on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness
(<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em>). In some places it is defined as the mindfulness
derived from engaging in the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, or as
equivalent to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. In other places
it is defined as ‘to be attentive, to be possessed of great
mindfulness, and to be able to recall what one has previously done
or said, even from a long time in the past’. The function of
mindfulness is to attend to or oversee (<em>upaṭṭhāna</em>) the mind. A
common definition for the faculty of mindfulness is ‘to recollect,
to guide the mind in its activities, and to remember that which one
has recently done or been engaged in’. {829}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faculty of concentration (<em>samādhi</em>; <em>samādhindriya</em>): this faculty
is described in the teaching on the four jhānas. In some places it
is defined as equivalent to the four jhānas, while in other places
it is defined as making relinquishment the object of attention,
resulting in concentration and one-pointedness. The function of
concentration is to make the mind unwavering and non-distracted
(<em>avikkhepa</em>). A common definition for the faculty of concentration
is ‘to have firmly established awareness, to be concentrated on an
activity and on an object of attention’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faculty of wisdom (<em>paññā</em>; <em>paññindriya</em>): this faculty is
described in the teaching of the Four Noble Truths. It is defined as
a direct knowledge of the Four Noble Truths: to be endowed with
noble wisdom which penetrates the truth of arising and ceasing,
which eradicates mental defilement and leads to the complete ending
of suffering. The function of wisdom is discernment (<em>dassana</em>) of
the truth. A common definition for the faculty of wisdom is ‘to know
according to the truth, to know thoroughly, to know accurately what
one is doing, to have insight into the nature of reality’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Buddha confirmed the words of Ven. Sāriputta stating that the five
spiritual faculties are interconnected. Faith gives rise to effort.
Effort reinforces mindfulness. Stable mindfulness leads to
concentration. Firm concentration results in wisdom: a profound
discernment of the perils of ignorance and craving, which are the cause
of the round of rebirth (<em>saṁsāra-vaṭṭa</em>). There arises an appreciation
for Nibbāna, a state free from the darkness of ignorance and agitation
of craving, a supreme peace. When a person gains clear insight into the
truth, he or she develops great faith or transcends faith. A person’s
practice thus circles back to the faculty of faith (<em>saddhindriya</em>), as
explained in the Buddha’s ending passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Sāriputta, a noble disciple puts forth effort in such a way. When he
has put forth effort, he recollects in such a way. When he has
recollected, his mind is concentrated in such a way. When his mind is
concentrated he understands clearly in such a way. When he has
understood clearly, he goes beyond faith (abhisaddhā) thus: ‘As to
these things that previously I had only heard about, they are truly
so, as I have now contacted them myself, and realized and penetrated
them with wisdom.’</p>
<p><em>S. V. 225-7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha gave a teaching on the four different paths of spiritual
practice: some people practise with difficulty and gain insight slowly;
some practise with difficulty but gain insight quickly; some practise
with ease but gain insight slowly; while some practise with ease and
gain insight quickly. Here, the Buddha explains that the determining
factors for the rate of spiritual development are the five faculties: if
the faculties are weak, insight will come slowly; if they are keen,
insight will come quickly.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn93">93</a></sup> The five faculties even determine the
different kinds of non-returners.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn94">94</a></sup></p>
<p>Generally speaking, the potency or deficiency of the five faculties is
the criterion for measuring the stage of a person’s awakening. When
these faculties are thoroughly complete, the person is an arahant. If
the faculties are less strong than this, the person is a non-returner, a
once-returner, a ‘truth-devotee’ (<em>dhammānusārī</em>) stream-enterer, or a
‘faith-devotee’ (<em>saddhānusārī</em>) stream-enterer, respectively. If
someone is completely devoid of these faculties, he is classified as an
unawakened person ‘outside’ (of the Dhammavinaya). {830} To sum up, a
difference in the spiritual faculties leads to a difference in spiritual
results; a difference in results leads to a difference in kinds of
persons.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn95">95</a></sup></p>
<p>The Paṭisambhidāmagga describes the five unwholesome qualities which are
eliminated by the five faculties:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn96">96</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Faith is in charge of devotion or resolve, and eliminates a lack of
trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effort is in charge of supporting or raising up the mind, and
eliminates laziness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mindfulness is in charge of guarding or protecting the mind, and
eliminates heedlessness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concentration is in charge of stabilizing the mind, and eliminates
restlessness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wisdom is in charge of discerning the truth, and eliminates
ignorance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Visuddhimagga mentions the importance of bringing the faculties into
balance with one another. It stresses that if one of the faculties is
overly strong while the others are weak, these other faculties are not
capable of fulfilling their functions. For example, if faith is overly
ardent, effort is unable to uplift the mind, mindfulness is unable to
protect the mind, concentration is unable to firmly establish the mind,
and wisdom is unable to discern the truth. It is then necessary to
reduce faith by using wisdom to contemplate the nature of reality or to
reflect in a way that does not further intensify faith.</p>
<p>In general, the commentaries recommend balancing the faculties in pairs,
by matching faith with wisdom, and concentration with effort. If faith
is strong and wisdom weak, a person may gain faith in something that is
not worthy of faith. If wisdom is strong but faith weak, a person will
incline towards arrogance and will be difficult to train, similar to an
illness which is caused by taking medicine. If concentration is strong
and effort weak, indolence will take hold of the mind, because <em>samādhi</em>
shares attributes with indolence (<em>kosajja</em>). If effort is strong and
concentration weak, however, a person will become restless, because
<em>viriya</em> shares attributes with restlessness (<em>uddhacca</em>). When these
two pairs of faculties are well-balanced, Dhamma practice progresses and
bears fruit, a principle which is also applied to meditation.</p>
<p>The commentaries mention some special circumstances: when one solely
practises tranquillity meditation, even if one’s faith is extremely
ardent, one may reach attainment concentration and concentrative
absorption. Strong faith is suitable to the development of
concentration. Similarly, in insight meditation there is no problem if
wisdom is overly developed as this will lead to more comprehensive
knowledge. These are special cases, however. If one applies the general
principle of balancing the two pairs of faculties, one’s practice will
bear fruit, for example by reaching attainment concentration.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is an exception to the above principle. The texts state that
the more powerful mindfulness is, the better. Increased mindfulness aids
other spiritual factors and prevents the mind from falling into either
restlessness or indolence. Both uplifting and restraining the mind
requires mindfulness. The commentaries cite the Buddha’s teachings that
for mindfulness to be effective it must be applied at all times and in
all circumstances,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn97">97</a></sup> and that mindfulness is the shelter and refuge
for the mind.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn98">98</a></sup> {831}</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when some of the faculties are overly developed
while others are weak, this situation must be rectified by cultivating
the corresponding enlightenment factors (<em>bojjhaṅga</em>). If there is too
much effort, for example, one can reduce this faculty by cultivating the
factor of tranquillity (<em>passaddhi</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn99">99</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the aforementioned teachings a person must train in and
develop all five of the spiritual faculties in order to progress in
spiritual practice. But as confirmed by the Buddha, there are exceptions
to this rule in situations where one develops only the essential
faculties. This is especially the case in the practice for complete
realization of the truth, which is the highest goal of Buddhism. In this
case, only four faculties need to be developed, by omitting the
cultivation of faith:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, because he has developed and cultivated four faculties, a
bhikkhu who has destroyed the taints declares the fruit of
arahantship.... What four? The faculty of energy, the faculty of
mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, the faculty of wisdom.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 223.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The next faculty which can be omitted is effort:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, because he has developed and cultivated three faculties,
Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja has declared the fruit of arahantship....
What three? The faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration,
and the faculty of wisdom.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 224.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>If necessary, the next faculty which can be omitted is mindfulness:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, because he has developed and cultivated two faculties, a
bhikkhu who has destroyed the taints declares the fruit of
arahantship.... What two? Noble wisdom and noble liberation. For his
noble wisdom is his faculty of wisdom; his noble liberation is his
faculty of concentration.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 222-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The faculty which is indispensable and which with adequate power (even
without an advanced development of concentration) can lead on its own to
the final realization of Buddha-Dhamma is wisdom:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, because he has developed and cultivated one faculty, a bhikkhu
who has destroyed the taints declares the fruit of arahantship....
What is that one faculty? The faculty of wisdom.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 222.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The passages describing the practice of only four, three, two, or a
single faculty do not imply that the omitted faculties are absent.
Although they are inconspicuous they are all still present to a
necessary degree. They are developed in conjunction with the chief
factors, but need not be given special prominence, as is seen in this
teaching on wisdom: {832}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>For a noble disciple who possesses wisdom, the faith that follows from
it becomes stabilized, the energy ... mindfulness ... concentration
that follows from it becomes stabilized.</p>
<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These exceptional cases apply to specific individuals who are endowed
with exceptional abilities. For ordinary people the aforementioned
practice of cultivating all five of the faculties evenly is appropriate.</p>
<p>The following passages on the importance of the spiritual faculties
highlight the role of wisdom in Buddhism:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, just as among all animals the lion, the king of beasts, is
declared to be their chief, that is, with respect to strength, speed,
and courage, so too, among the states conducive to enlightenment
(bodhipakkhiya-dhamma) the faculty of wisdom is declared to be their
chief, that is, for the attainment of enlightenment (bodha).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn100">100</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 227.</em></p>
<p>Monks, just as in a house with a peaked roof: so long as the roof peak
has not been set in place, there is as yet no stability of the
rafters, there is as yet no steadiness of the rafters; but when the
roof peak has been set in place, then there is stability of the
rafters, then there is steadiness of the rafters. So too, so long as
noble knowledge has not arisen in the noble disciple, there is as yet
no stability of the [other] four faculties, no steadiness of the
[other] four faculties. But when noble knowledge has arisen in the
noble disciple, then there is stability of the [other] four
faculties, then there is steadiness of the [other] four faculties.
What four? The faculty of faith, the faculty of energy, the faculty of
mindfulness, the faculty of concentration. In the case of a noble
disciple who possesses wisdom, the faith that follows from it becomes
stabilized, the energy ... mindfulness ... concentration that follows
from it becomes stabilized.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 228-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3><a class="header" href="#wisdoms-task-force" id="wisdoms-task-force">Wisdom’s Task Force</a></h3>
<p>This heading, Wisdom’s Task Force, as well as the expression the ‘arena
of practice for wisdom’, refers to the seven factors of enlightenment
(<em>bojjhaṅga</em>). The enlightenment factors are both a support for
developing concentration and a way to apply concentration for achieving
higher ends, up to and including the highest goal of true knowledge
(<em>vijjā</em>) and liberation (<em>vimutti</em>). The seven factors are:
mindfulness, investigation of truth, effort, bliss, tranquillity,
concentration, and equanimity.</p>
<p>The Buddha gave a short definition for the enlightenment factors: ‘They
are called enlightenment factors because they are conducive to
awakening.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn101">101</a></sup> Based on a literal analysis of the term <em>bojjhaṅga</em>,
the commentaries translate it as either ‘attributes of an awakened
person’, ‘attributes of one about to be awakened’, or ‘factors of
awakening’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn102">102</a></sup> {833}</p>
<p>In principle the enlightenment factors are adversaries to the five
hindrances (<em>nīvaraṇa</em>). Most of the time the Buddha mentioned these
factors in combination with the hindrances, in the capacity of opposing
forces.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn103">103</a></sup> The attributes of the enlightenment factors are opposite
to the attributes of the hindrances:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, these seven factors of enlightenment are not obstructions, are
not hindrances, are not corruptions of the mind; when developed and
cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge
and liberation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn104">104</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 93.</em></p>
<p>Monks, these seven factors of enlightenment are makers of vision,
makers of knowledge, promoting the growth of wisdom, free from
distress, leading towards Nibbāna.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 97-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As mentioned earlier the hindrances destroy the quality of the mind. The
hindrances can be used to measure the level of deterioration of a
person’s mental health. The enlightenment factors on the other hand
enhance the quality of the mind and promote mental health. They can be
used as a yardstick to evaluate mental health.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn105">105</a></sup></p>
<p>Definitions for the seven factors of enlightenment are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mindfulness (<em>sati</em>): recollection; to recall, reflect, or to hold
attention on something with which one is engaged or on a required
activity. In the context of the enlightenment factors, <em>sati</em>
encompasses both the vigilant role of mindfulness – in which
attention rests on a specific object of consideration<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn106">106</a></sup> – and
the recollection of Dhamma teachings and of necessary activities in
order to submit them for inspection by wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn107">107</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigation of truth (<em>dhamma-vicaya</em>): search for truth; to apply
wisdom in order to investigate the object focused on by <em>sati</em> or
the Dhamma teaching submitted by <em>sati</em>. For example: to contemplate
the essential meaning and value of the object under consideration;
to examine and select those things that are beneficial to one’s life
or are most suitable to the present circumstances; to discern how
the object arises, is sustained, and passes away; to understand the
object in the context of the Three Characteristics; and to realize
the Four Noble Truths.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn108">108</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effort (<em>viriya</em>): energy; fearlessness; persistence; ardent
enthusiasm for that under investigation by wisdom; courage to
perform good deeds; strength of heart; fighting spirit;
perseverance; a hastening to improve; an ability to uplift the mind;
an ability to prevent despondency and discouragement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bliss (<em>pīti</em>): delight; joy; contentment; deep pleasure; rapture;
exhilaration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tranquillity (<em>passaddhi</em>): mental and physical ease, relaxation,
serenity, calm; an absence of stress and agitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concentration (<em>samādhi</em>): one-pointed focus on an object of
attention; steady and consistent attention to an activity; an
absence of distraction, vacillation, and mental disturbance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>): objectivity; impartiality; to observe
equanimously and calmly when the mind is focused on an activity and
when things progress according to plan or according to how they
ought to be, or when it is not yet time to strive or be busily
engaged; an absence of interference and intrusion. {834}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Buddha mentioned the nourishment (<em>āhāra</em>) and the ‘denourishment’
(<em>anāhāra</em>) of the hindrances and the enlightenment factors. The
nourishment which spawns, invigorates, and increases the hindrances is a
lack of wise reflection (<em>ayoniso-manasikāra</em>); the denourishment, which
does not feed or support the hindrances, is wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>). Likewise, the nourishment which generates,
promotes, and perfects the enlightenment factors is wise reflection; the
denourishment is a lack of wise reflection.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn109">109</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nourishment and Denourishment of the Five Hindrances:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sensual desire: a lack of wise reflection regarding images of
beauty (<em>subha-nimitta</em>) is the nourishment;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn110">110</a></sup> a wise
reflection on images of impurity (<em>asubha-nimitta</em>) is the
denourishment.</p>

<p>Nourishment and Denourishment of the Seven Enlightenment Factors:</p>

<li>
<p>The nourishment for investigation of truth is wise reflection on

<p>The nourishment for tranquillity is wise reflection on physical

</li>
<li>
<p>The nourishment for concentration is wise reflection on
‘concentrative signs’ (<em>samādhi-nimitta</em>) and those things that

</li>
<li>
<p>The nourishment for equanimity is wise reflection on those
things acting as a basis for equanimity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conversely, the denourishment of the enlightenment factors is a lack of
wise reflection on those things giving rise to each of these factors
(the specific nourishment, mentioned above).</p>
<p>The things acting as a basis for mindfulness are the objects focused
upon by mindfulness. One commentarial passage describes these as the
thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (<em>bodhipakkhiya-dhamma</em>) and the
nine supramundane states (<em>lokuttara-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn113">113</a></sup> From a wider
perspective, however, this refers to the practice of the Four
Foundations of Mindfulness. The Visuddhimagga and the Sammohavinodanī
describe four more qualities giving rise to mindfulness:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn114">114</a></sup>
mindfulness &amp; clear comprehension (<em>sati-sampajañña</em>), avoidance of
people with muddled awareness, association with people well-guarded by
mindfulness, and devotion to the enlightenment factor of mindfulness.</p>
<p>The commentaries outline seven qualities that give rise to
investigation: (1) to be an inquirer; (2) to make things clean and
bright;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn115">115</a></sup> (3) to balance the spiritual faculties; (4) to avoid the
company of fools; (5) to associate with the wise; (6) to contemplate
matters requiring deep insight; (7) to devote oneself to the
investigation of truth.</p>
<p>The commentaries list eleven qualities that give rise to effort: (1) to
reflect on various dangers, e.g. the danger of wickedness (to rouse
oneself by recognizing that if one makes no effort one will encounter
such dangers); (2) to discern the blessings of making effort, which
leads to exceptional mundane and supramundane results; (3) to consider
that this path of practice was traversed by exceptional people,
including the Buddha and his great disciples; if we are lazy and slack
in our efforts we will never achieve the goal; (4) to honour almsfood by
aspiring to generate blessings for the donor; (5) to consider the
greatness of the Buddha and to remember that he praised effort; to
consider that we should honour his compassion and kindness through
devoted effort; (6) to consider that one should act in a way that is
worthy of inheriting the magnificent legacy of the true Dhamma; (7) to
reduce sloth &amp; torpor through various means, like switching postures and
developing the perception of light (<em>āloka-saññā</em>); (8) to avoid
indolent people; (9) to associate with industrious people; (10) to
reflect on the four right efforts (<em>sammappadhāna</em>); (11) to devote
oneself to making effort.</p>
<p>The commentaries describe eleven qualities that give rise to bliss:
(1-3) to recollect the virtues of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the
Sangha; (4) to recollect one’s own virtuous behaviour (<em>sīla</em>); (5) to
recollect one’s generosity and acts of renunciation; (6) to reflect on
divine beings and on the qualities leading to divinity (<em>deva-dhamma</em>)
inherent in oneself; (7) to reflect on the state of peace (i.e.
Nibbāna); (8) to avoid gloomy, depressed people; (9) to associate with
cheerful people; (10) to reflect on suttas inspiring devotion; (11) to
incline the mind towards bliss. {836}</p>
<p>The commentaries describe seven qualities that give rise to
tranquillity: (1) to consume fine food; (2) to reside in a comfortable
environment; (3) to abide in a comfortable posture; (4) to exert effort
in a balanced, measured way; (5) to avoid nervous, stressful people; (6)
to associate with calm, relaxed people; (7) to incline oneself towards
tranquillity.</p>
<p>The commentaries describe eleven qualities that give rise to
concentration: (1) to make things clean and bright; (2) to be discerning
in regard to mental images (<em>nimitta</em>); (3) to balance the spiritual
faculties; (4) to restrain the mind when appropriate; (5) to uplift the
mind when appropriate; (6) when the mind is unhappy, to gladden it
through faith and a sense of awe (<em>saṁvega</em>);<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn116">116</a></sup> (7) when the mind is
functioning well, to practise equanimity; (8) to avoid people who lack
concentration; (9) to associate with people who are endowed with
concentration; (10) to reflect on mental liberation (<em>vimokkha</em>); (11)
to be devoted to concentration.</p>
<p>The commentaries describe five qualities that give rise to equanimity:
(1) to be non-discriminatory towards all living beings (both monks and
laypeople); (2) to be objective about conditioned phenomena (both one’s
internal physical organs and one’s personal belongings); (3) to avoid
people who are anxious about and jealously guard things (including other
people and personal possessions); (4) to associate with people who are
unbiased towards living beings and conditioned phenomena; (5) to incline
the mind towards equanimity.</p>
<p>The seven factors of enlightenment are mutually connected, as confirmed
by the following teaching by the Buddha.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn117">117</a></sup> In sum, a monk who has
studied with and listened to the Dhamma from a wise, virtuous person,
who dwells in both physical and mental solitude, has an excellent
opportunity for realization:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When someone reviews, recollects, and verifies that Dhamma that he
has heard or studied ... he develops the enlightenment factor of
mindfulness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he bears this Dhamma in mind, he selects it, analyzes it,
examines it, and investigates it .... He develops the enlightenment
factor of investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he analyzes, examines, and investigates he exerts effort. The
more he analyzes, discerns, clearly understands, and grasps the
essential meaning, the greater is his energy and will-power, the
more he strives and perseveres, undaunted.... He develops the
enlightenment factor of energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he rouses energy, is diligent and increasingly enthusiastic,
there arises bliss independent of sensual desires.... He develops
the enlightenment factor of bliss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the mind is blissful, both the mind and body are relaxed and
calmed, and there arise mental and physical tranquillity.... He
develops the enlightenment factor of tranquillity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the body is relaxed and at ease, the mind becomes firmly
established and concentrated.... He develops the enlightenment
factor of concentration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the mind is concentrated on an activity and functions well, it
becomes steady and composed; a person simply observes at ease and
with equanimity.... He develops the enlightenment factor of
equanimity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Buddha taught how the Four Foundations of
Mindfulness nourish the seven factors of enlightenment. When developed
and cultivated, the Four Foundations of Mindfulness bring the seven
factors of enlightenment to completion; and when the enlightenment
factors are developed and cultivated, they in turn bring true knowledge
and liberation to completion.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn118">118</a></sup> The development of the Four
Foundations of Mindfulness thus acts as a basis, enabling the group of
enlightenment factors to enter the arena of practice. {837}</p>
<p>When developing contemplation of the body, feelings, the mind, or mind
objects, one is endowed with unremitting mindfulness. When one is
attentive in this way, one applies wisdom to examine, inquire, and
analyze according to the principle of Dhamma investigation. From this
point the gradual development of the other enlightenment factors
proceeds as described above, eventually leading to true knowledge and
liberation.</p>
<p>Likewise, when one is listening to the Dhamma, if one firmly establishes
the mind, reflects, devotes oneself with all one’s heart, and listens
carefully, at that time the hindrances will be absent and the seven
factors of enlightenment may reach completion.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn119">119</a></sup></p>
<p>The seven factors of enlightenment can be developed along with other
spiritual qualities. For example, they can be developed along with the
meditation on breathing, along with the four unbounded states of mind
(<em>appamaññā</em>), or along with recollections, e.g. the perception of
impermanence, the perception of foulness, the contemplation on
dispassion, and the contemplation on cessation. The enlightenment
factors assist these other qualities to be of supreme benefit, to be
conducive to true safety, conducive to a sense of urgency and an ardent
striving towards wholesomeness, and conducive to dwelling in
peace.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn120">120</a></sup></p>
<p>The Buddha encouraged the application of the enlightenment factors in
meditation practice. These factors help to support the mind when a
person is beginning to meditate and they strengthen concentration:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn121">121</a></sup></p>
<div class="sutta">

<p>In the Pali Canon the seven factors of enlightenment are described in
several ways: as the ‘effort to cultivate (wholesome states)’ –
<em>bhāvanā-padhāna</em>;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn122">122</a></sup> as the pinnacle of all forms of effort;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn123">123</a></sup>
as the ‘strength of spiritual development’ (<em>bhāvanā-bala</em>);<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn124">124</a></sup> as
the means to eliminate the taints by way of spiritual development;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn125">125</a></sup>
as kamma that is neither ‘black’ nor ‘white’, leading to the end of
kamma;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn126">126</a></sup> as ‘conditions of prosperity’ (<em>aparihāniya-dhamma</em>),
leading solely to growth and not to decline;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn127">127</a></sup> and as the path
leading to the Unconditioned – Nibbāna – similar to the other
qualities contributing to enlightenment (<em>bodhipakkhiya-dhamma</em>).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#unity-and-harmony-of-the-path-factors" id="unity-and-harmony-of-the-path-factors">Unity and Harmony of the Path Factors</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the objective of ‘right concentration’
(<em>sammā-samādhi</em>) is to act as the domain of practice for wisdom – to
make the mind the most suitable environment for spiritual qualities to
work in unison in order to realize the truth, to eliminate mental
impurity, and to reach the state that is completely free from suffering.
It was described earlier how the eight factors of the Path act in
harmony and are mutually supportive, with right view acting as the
leader. Here, we can conclude that the first seven path factors help to
generate, support, and reinforce concentration, giving rise to ‘right
concentration’, which can be applied effectively according to one’s
needs. Concentration yields results and furthers one’s practice, leading
at the final stage to two more factors: right knowledge (<em>sammā-ñāṇa</em>)
and right liberation (<em>sammā-vimutti</em>).</p>
<p>The Buddha refers to these first seven path factors as requisites of
concentration (<em>samādhi-parikkhāra</em>): they are the elements, the
accompanying conditions, the supports, and the determinants of
concentration. Concentration possessed of these requisites is referred
to as ‘noble right concentration’ (<em>ariya-sammāsamādhi</em>), which leads to
the final goal:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully
enlightened, has well proclaimed the seven requisites of
concentration, for the cultivation and the perfection of right
concentration. What are these seven? They are right view, right
thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness. That one-pointedness of mind surrounded by these
seven factors is called the noble right concentration with its bases
(upanissaya; support, foundation) and requisites.</p>
<p>When there is right view, right thought is suitable for action; when
there is right thought, right speech is suitable for action; when
there is right speech, right action is suitable for action; when there
is right action, right livelihood is suitable for action; when there
is right livelihood, right effort is suitable for action; when there
is right effort, right mindfulness is suitable for action; when there
is right mindfulness, right concentration is suitable for action; when
there is right concentration, right knowledge is suitable for action;
when there is right knowledge, right liberation is suitable for
action.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn128">128</a></sup> {839}</p>
<p><em>D. II. 216-7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When the Eightfold Path (<em>aṭṭhaṅgika-magga</em>) has been developed to the
point of completion, an instant occurs in which all of the path factors
function in unison, giving rise to profound knowledge and a realization
of truth, and eliminating the defilements which overlay and oppress the
mind. This occurrence in which the path factors function concurrently is
specifically called the ‘Path’ (<em>magga</em>), because in this instant all
the path factors are truly integrated. When the Path operates in this
way, there are resulting fruits (<em>phala</em>), namely, knowledge of the
truth, release from mental defilement, and a freedom from suffering.</p>
<p>If everything proceeds in order, there are four occasions or stages in
which the Path operates in a potent or conclusive fashion, referred to
as the four ‘paths’. In the same way, there are four ‘fruits’.
Collectively, they are called the four noble paths (<em>ariya-magga</em>) and
the four noble fruits (<em>ariya-phala</em>), i.e.: the path of stream-entry,
the fruit of stream-entry, the path of once-returning, the fruit of
once-returning, the path of non-returning, the fruit of non-returning,
the path of arahantship, and the fruit of arahantship. In reference to
its eight factors, this culmination of the Path is called the Eightfold
Path; in reference to practical application or to active functionality,
which has four stages, it is called the ‘four paths’
(<em>catumagga</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn129">129</a></sup></p>
<p>The joint operation of spiritual factors in a single mind-moment,
bringing desired results to completion, is referred to in the scriptures
as ‘harmony of spiritual qualities’ (<em>dhamma-sāmaggī</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn130">130</a></sup> This
harmony of spiritual qualities is equivalent to awakening
(<em>bodhi</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn131">131</a></sup> It is not only the eight Path factors which act in
unison during this single moment of the ‘path’, but the thirty-seven
factors of enlightenment (<em>bodhipakkhiya-dhamma</em>) do so as well.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn132">132</a></sup>
In any case, the thirty-seven enlightenment factors can all be distilled
into the eight factors of the Path.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn133">133</a></sup> For this reason, when the term
‘Path’ is used, this necessarily incorporates related spiritual
qualities.</p>
<p>One may raise the question of how it is that several Path factors can
operate in a single instance. Especially, one may ask how the factors
related to moral conduct, like right speech and right action, are
involved in such a situation. {840} To answer these questions let us
look at the comparable example of someone who is able to fire a rifle or
shoot an arrow with great accuracy. On the occasion of an archery
competition we see this individual gain victory by hitting the bull’s
eye, and she accomplishes this deed in a single instant.</p>
<p>A superficial glance may lead to the conclusion that this person simply
has a steady hand and one will leave it at that. But a deeper inspection
of the causes and conditions for the steady hand and the accuracy of the
shot in that instant may reveal a long period of training before this
event. This person has trained in developing correct posture, by
focusing on the position of the entire body, the feet, the legs, the
arms, and the shoulders; she has trained in how to properly grasp the
weapon, taking aim, estimating distance, and finding the right balance
of strength. She has sharpened her wits, developed resourcefulness and
resolve, and strengthened concentration, until there arose skill and
proficiency, an ability to shoot instantly, and a feeling that the
action happens automatically and effortlessly.</p>
<p>We must take into consideration all of these factors which have reached
completion when we witness this person display such accuracy: it is the
sum total of physical equipoise and competence, self-assurance,
concentration, and mental dexterity. In other words, all the factors of
physical fitness, mental preparedness and maturity, understanding, and
sound judgement function together when shooting the arrow in that single
moment. In retrospect, the physical capability, mental capability, and
wisdom capability in that moment are the fruits of a lengthy training.
The ability to shoot the arrow accurately is the result of months and
years of practice.</p>
<p>This matter is related to the differences between individual
practitioners, especially in regard to the level of proficiency or
potency of the spiritual faculties. Some people attain results easily
with only a little amount of training. Others train for a long time
before attaining results, but their practice proceeds with ease. Others,
meanwhile, must train for both a long time and with great difficulty
before reaching success. And finally, some people, no matter how much
they train, are incapable of attaining success. Besides the inherent
differences between people, spiritual attainments and the speed of such
attainments depend on other factors, in particular: the correctness of a
specific spiritual practice, the presence of a good guide or teacher
(referred to as a ‘virtuous friend’ – <em>kalyāṇamitta</em>), a person’s
physical state of health, and a person’s physical environment. The
Buddha classified four different ways of practice (<em>paṭipadā</em>) leading
to spiritual accomplishment:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn134">134</a></sup> {841}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A person practises with difficulty and gains higher knowledge
(<em>abhiññā</em>) slowly (<em>dukkhā paṭipadā dandhābhiññā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person practises with difficulty but gains higher knowledge
quickly (<em>dukkhā paṭipadā khippābhiññā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person practises with ease but gains higher knowledge slowly
(<em>sukhā paṭipadā dandhābhiññā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person practises with ease and gains higher knowledge quickly
(<em>sukhā paṭipadā khippābhiññā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Concentration too is a factor determining the level of difficulty in
practice and the speed with which a person attains knowledge. It was
mentioned earlier how a Dhamma practitioner may develop insight at once,
by relying on only a rudimentary level of concentration, and this person
may even realize the final goal of knowledge of the destruction of the
taints (<em>āsavakkhaya-ñāṇa</em>). Someone who first develops concentration
and attains concentrative absorption (<em>jhāna</em>), however, is able to
build a firm foundation for the development of insight. This is made
more clear in the context of the four ways of practice mentioned above.
A person who has attained the four jhānas is described as practising
with ease (<em>sukhā paṭipadā</em>). As for someone who practises the
meditation on foulness, the perception on the loathsomeness of food, or
the recollection on death – which only lead to the first jhāna or to
access concentration – his practice will be arduous and less cheerful
(<em>dukkhā paṭipadā</em>).</p>
<p>The following teachings by the Buddha describe ways of practice in which
the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are linked to the eight
factors of the Path. From a superficial perspective these practices may
appear easy. It is true that for someone who is prepared, they are easy.
But for someone who is unprepared, they are difficult, and such a person
may have to engage in many other practices before he or she is ready:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, when one knows and sees the eye as it actually is, when one
knows and sees forms ... eye-consciousness ... eye-contact ... the
feeling of pleasure, or pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure that arises
with eye-contact as condition, then one is not infatuated by the eye
[... forms, etc.].</p>
<p>When one abides uninfatuated, unfettered, unbeguiled, discerning
danger, then the five aggregates of clinging reach a state of no
further growth; and one’s craving – which leads to renewed existence,
is accompanied by delight and lust (nandi-rāga), and pursues various
sense impressions – is abandoned. One’s bodily and mental troubles,
one’s bodily and mental torments, one’s bodily and mental passions are
abandoned, and one experiences bodily and mental pleasure.</p>
<p>The view of a person such as this is right view; his intention is
right intention, his effort is right effort, his mindfulness is right
mindfulness, his concentration is right concentration. And his bodily
action, his verbal action, and his livelihood have already been well
purified from the start. In this way the Noble Eightfold Path comes to
fulfilment and completion for him.</p>
<p>When he develops this Noble Eightfold Path, the four foundations of
mindfulness also come to fulfilment and completion; the four right
efforts ... the four paths to success ... the five spiritual faculties
... the five spiritual powers ... the seven factors of enlightenment
also come to fulfilment and completion. {842}</p>
<p>These two things – serenity and insight – occur in him joined evenly
together. He fully understands by direct knowledge (See
Note <a href="#note-higher-wisdom">Higher Wisdom</a>) those things that should be fully
understood by direct knowledge. He abandons by direct knowledge those
things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge. He develops by
direct knowledge those things that should be developed by direct
knowledge. He realizes by direct knowledge those things that should be
realized by direct knowledge.</p>
<p>And what things should be fully understood by direct knowledge? The
answer to that is: the five aggregates of clinging: the material form
aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by
clinging, the perception aggregate affected by clinging, the
volitional formations aggregate affected by clinging, the
consciousness aggregate affected by clinging....</p>
<p>And what things should be abandoned by direct knowledge?: ignorance
and craving for existence....</p>
<p>And what things should be developed by direct knowledge?: serenity and
insight.</p>
<p>And what things should be realized by direct knowledge?: true
knowledge and deliverance.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn135">135</a></sup></p>

<p>The term <em>abhiññā</em> is a very important word in the Buddhist teachings.
It means ‘higher wisdom’ or ‘supreme knowledge’, equated with
<em>uttama-paññā</em> at AA. II. 95, and with <em>adhika-ñāṇa</em> at: VinA. I. 125;
DA. I. 175; PsA. I. 136.</p>
<p>Literally, it can be translated as ‘direct knowledge’, ‘penetrative
knowledge’, ‘precise knowledge’, or ‘transcendent knowledge’ (this
last expression may be interpreted as ‘knowledge surpassing what is
discernible by way of the five senses’).</p>
<p>The Aṭṭhasālinī and the Visuddhimagga explain <em>abhiññā</em> as knowledge
present from the stage of access concentration to the stage of
attainment concentration (DhsA. 182; Vism. 86-7). The
Paramatthamañjusā defines it specifically as knowledge arising in the
state of attainment concentration (<em>appanā-paññā</em>; VismṬ.:
Kammaṭṭhānaggahaṇaniddesavaṇṇanā, Samādhicatukkavaṇṇanā). At times it
resembles the knowledge of intuition (more research should be done
examining the mental state of intuition).</p>

<p>A similar passage states:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, a monk lives the holy life (<em>brahmacariya</em>) with the training
as its blessing, with wisdom as pinnacle, with liberation as essence,
with mindfulness as governing principle.</p>
<p>And how does the holy life have the training as its blessing? Here, I
have laid down the training in virtuous conduct for disciples in this
Dhamma and Discipline for the sake of instilling faith in those who do
not have faith and of increasing faith in the faithful. In whatever
way I have laid down the training in virtuous conduct, those disciples
practise and train in the training rules so, observing them fully, not
in a defective, patchy, or tainted way. Moreover, I have laid down the
training in the principles of the holy life for disciples for the sake
of the complete and utter end of suffering. In whatever way I have
laid down the training in the principles of the holy life, those
disciples practise and train in the training rules so, observing them
fully, not in a defective, patchy, or tainted way. In this manner the
holy life has the training as its blessing.</p>
<p>And how does the holy life have wisdom as its pinnacle? I have taught
the Dhamma to disciples for the sake of the complete and utter end of
suffering. In whatever way I have taught the Dhamma, just so, the
disciples discern these teachings completely with wisdom. In this
manner the holy life has wisdom as its pinnacle.</p>
<p>And how does the holy life have liberation as its essence? I have
taught the Dhamma to disciples for the sake of the complete and utter
end of suffering. In whatever way I have taught the Dhamma, just so,
the disciples contact these teachings by way of liberation. In this
manner the holy life has liberation as its essence.</p>
<p>And how does the holy life have mindfulness as its governing
principle? Here, disciples are well attentive and inwardly vigilant
thus: ‘I will cultivate and fulfil the training in virtuous conduct
which is yet incomplete, or else by way of wisdom in these respects I
will sustain the training in virtuous conduct which is complete.... I
will cultivate and fulfil the training in the principles of the holy
life which is incomplete, or else by way of wisdom in these respects I
will sustain the training in the principles of the holy life which is
complete.... I will completely examine and discern by way of wisdom in
these respects those things that I have not yet completely discerned,

discernment of things.... I will contact by way of liberation those
things not yet contacted, or else by way of wisdom in these respects I

<h2><a class="header" href="#ways-of-developing-concentration" id="ways-of-developing-concentration">Ways of Developing Concentration</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a Dhamma practitioner may use only a basic level
of concentration (called ‘momentary concentration’ – <em>khaṇika-samādhi</em>)
as a beginning point for applying wisdom in order to investigate reality
in line with the teachings on insight, and this concentration develops
alongside the development of insight. Although the concentration
developed in such a practice will eventually be powerful enough to
enable the person to reach the goal of insight meditation – the freedom
from suffering, the end of all mental impurity, and the realization of
Nibbāna – it will not be strong enough to obtain exceptional psychic
attainments: the various mundane psychic powers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to begin spiritual practice with weak concentration is
similar to setting off on a journey in a state of physical weakness: the
fitness for travelling is diminished. Even if the person hopes to
gradually grow stronger as the journey progresses, he is no match for
someone who is fit from the beginning, strong and confident. And if
wisdom is not sharp, the path is even more arduous. Conversely, an
over-emphasis of wisdom can lead to restlessness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn137">137</a></sup> There is thus a
traditional emphasis in Buddhism to train in and develop concentration
from the beginning, at least to some degree. Although the aim is not to
obtain extraordinary psychic powers, there is a wish to develop a stable
foundation of mental composure, adequate for the further development of
wisdom.</p>
<p>This matter is made clearer by looking at examples from everyday life.
Some people are unable to perform actions requiring deliberation – not
to mention applying wisdom and reflecting on things deeply – if there
is even a small disturbance of noise or if other people are moving about
around them. There are others, however, whose minds are more
concentrated and stable. Even though they are surrounded by disturbing
sounds or crowds of people, they are able to perform actions requiring
mindfulness and wisdom without difficulty.</p>
<p>Some people have great mental strength; although they are in alarming or
frightening situations, they are unperturbed and are able to use wisdom
to look at and analyze the situation. It is said that the French emperor
Napoleon the First had great mental power; he was able to recall any
matter at any time he wished, and was able to block out any unwanted
thoughts. His mind was like a chest of drawers in which information was
stored and well-ordered; he was able to pull out relevant data as he
wished. Although he was in the tumult of the battlefield among the noise
of guns and loud explosives, the sound of fighting men and neighing
horses, he maintained a calm demeanour and was able to think astutely,
as if nothing unusual was happening. If he wished to rest he was able to
fall asleep immediately.</p>
<p>This is different from most ordinary people who have not trained
themselves. When they fall into such situations, not only can they not
reflect on what is happening, they often cannot keep their minds still;
they tend to be frightened, bewildered, and confused. Although I do not
have substantiating evidence for this story, most of us can recognize
the difference between those people whose minds are strong and those
whose minds are weak.</p>
<p>This account of Emperor Napoleon is not so remarkable if we compare it
with stories from the scriptures. There is the story, for example, of
Āḷāra Kālāma, who while travelling on a long journey was sitting under
the shade of a tree.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn138">138</a></sup> A caravan of about five hundred wagons passed
close by to him, but he neither saw nor heard them. The Buddha himself
was once staying in the town of Ātumā when a resounding thunderstorm
broke out. Two farmers and four cows were struck and killed by lightning
close to where the Buddha sat, but the Buddha was dwelling in a tranquil
abiding and heard nothing.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn139">139</a></sup> {795} The Buddha once gave a teaching
saying that there are only four beings who are not startled by
lightning: an arahant, a well-trained elephant, a thoroughbred horse,
and a lion.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn140">140</a></sup></p>
<p>Among ordinary people there is a great discrepancy when it comes to the
power of the mind, the power of wisdom, and the stability of the mind.
For most people the stability and power of the mind is not great and
their wisdom is not sharp. Many contemporary teachers therefore say that
if a person has not prepared the mind properly as the arena in which
wisdom can operate, the opportunity to realize the truth by way of
transcendent wisdom (<em>lokuttara-paññā</em>) is extremely slim. They
emphasize the training of the mind through formal meditation (’the
cultivation of concentration’ – <em>samādhi-bhāvanā</em>) as a solid
foundation on which an earnest cultivation of wisdom can be established.</p>
<p>Although the essence of the training in concentration can be
encapsulated in just a few words, the actual practice of concentration
is highly detailed. The subject of concentration becomes even more broad
and detailed if one includes the application of a unified mind as the
domain of practice for wisdom in order to realize the supreme goal of
Buddhism. The entire practice of concentration can be referred to as
tranquillity (<em>samatha</em>) and insight (<em>vipassanā</em>), which could easily
be the subject of another book. Here, however, I will only present an
outline of the key principles regarding concentration.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#natural-development-of-concentration" id="natural-development-of-concentration">Natural Development of Concentration</a></h3>
<p>This heading refers to a spiritual practice conforming to a natural
process within which concentration arises automatically – or without
requiring a deliberate intention – a process which the Buddha spoke
about on many occasions. The essence of this process is for a person to
perform virtuous deeds, which are a source of joy. Joy is then followed
respectively by delight, relaxation, happiness, and finally
concentration. This is illustrated in the following way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><em>Pāmojja</em> (joy) →<br />
<em>pīti</em> (delight; satisfaction) →<br />
<em>passaddhi</em> (physical ease and relaxation) →<br />
<em>sukha</em> (mental ease and happiness) →<br />
<em>samādhi</em> (concentration).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, this process is only possible when virtuous conduct
acts as a support. Virtuous conduct here refers to refraining from
oppressing or violating others, actions which cause distress, mistrust,
fear of retribution, guilt, and remorse. Instead, a person acts in an
upright manner, which leads to a sense of inner contentment and
self-confidence. There are many actions which give rise to joy and
delight, for example: one may recall one’s own virtuous acts and
meritorious deeds; one may recollect the Triple Gem and other excellent
qualities; or one may reflect on a particular teaching and gain insight
into it.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn141">141</a></sup> {796}</p>
<p>The basis or the most closely related factor for the arising of
concentration is happiness, as is confirmed by the Buddha’s standard
teaching: ‘For one who is happy the mind becomes concentrated’ (<em>sukhino
cittaṁ samādhiyati</em>). The passage in full is as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>[When he understands the essence and the principle of the Dhamma]
gladness arises. When he is gladdened delight arises; when the mind is
delighted the body becomes calm; one calm in body feels happy; for one
who is happy the mind becomes concentrated.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn142">142</a></sup></p>
<p><em>D. III. 241-2; A. III. 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The natural development of concentration mentioned here is in fact the
essence of all forms of concentrative meditation up to the stage of
attaining jhāna. The details of such meditation are described below.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#development-of-concentration-in-line-with-the-paths-to-success" id="development-of-concentration-in-line-with-the-paths-to-success">Development of Concentration in Line with the Paths to Success</a></h3>
<p>The term <em>iddhipāda</em> can be translated as ‘factors leading to spiritual
power’, ‘factors leading to success’, or ‘paths to success’. There are
four such factors: <em>chanda</em> (’enthusiasm’, ‘love’), <em>viriya</em> (’energy’,
‘perseverance’), <em>citta</em> (’focused attention’), and <em>vimaṁsā</em>
(’investigation’, ‘wise reflection’).</p>
<p>The Buddha spoke about the paths to success in relation to
concentration, because the paths to success give rise to concentration
and lead to results which are the goal of concentration. The
concentration arising from each of the four paths to success is named
after each such factor, as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn143">143</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Chanda-samādhi</em>: concentration arising from enthusiasm;
concentration with enthusiasm as the prominent factor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Viriya-samādhi</em>: concentration arising from energy; concentration
with energy as the prominent factor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Citta-samādhi</em>: concentration arising from focused attention;
concentration with focused attention as the prominent factor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vimaṁsā-samādhi</em>: concentration arising from investigation;
concentration with investigation as the prominent factor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, these forms of concentration arise in connection with diligent
effort (<em>padhāna-saṅkhāra</em>). <em>Padhāna-saṅkhāra</em> can also be translated
as the ‘volitional formation of effort’, ‘effort as a determining
factor’, ‘effort as a creative force’, or ‘supportive effort’. This
refers to the four kinds of effort (<em>padhāna</em>), which perform the
functions of prevention, relinquishment, cultivation, and protection.</p>
<p>Concentration arises from the four factors leading to success in the
following ways:</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#enthusiasm-chanda" id="enthusiasm-chanda">Enthusiasm (chanda)</a></h4>
<p>An enthusiasm for the activity that one is engaged in; a keen interest
in the objective of such an activity; a wish to bring this activity to
fulfilment and completion; a love for one’s work and for the goal of
one’s work. On a deeper level, it is a love and desire for a wholesome,
complete state, which is the goal of one’s actions or is accessible
through one’s actions; a desire for something to arrive at or be
established in the greatest degree of goodness, excellence, precision,
and perfection; a desire for this wholesome, complete state to truly
manifest; a desire to find success conforming to such goodness. {797}</p>
<p>This desire is different from a desire to consume or to possess
something, which is referred to as ‘craving’ (<em>taṇhā</em>). The desire of
enthusiasm generates happiness and delight when a person witnesses that
object or that activity reach completion and fulfilment; indeed, a
person already experiences delight when that object or activity moves in
the direction of fulfilment. When the object or activity reaches its
goal, a person experiences deep satisfaction and unbounded joy. The
desire of craving on the other hand gives rise to pleasure when a person
obtains an object of enjoyment or obtains something that increases a
sense of self-importance. This form of pleasure taints or corrupts a
person, is a hindrance and constriction, and tends to leave
covetousness, anxiety, grief, regret, and fear in its wake.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn144">144</a></sup></p>
<p>Take for example a young child who when alone draws a picture in a
loving, painstaking way, determined to have this picture be as pretty
and perfect as possible, or a child who carefully puts together a model
boat or airplane, aiming for precision. Such a child is happy when this
act of painting or building proceeds well and gradually reaches
completion. He or she will rejoice even more – perhaps even jump with
joy – when the work is completed. This child performs the activity with
a steadfast and concentrated mind, zeroing in on the goal. He or she
finds happiness through the activity and the completion of the activity.
This happiness does not arise from an external object of enjoyment; it
is free from material enticements and does not require the praise from
other people: it does not rely on any form of reward, either sensual
(<em>kāma</em>) or connected to the process of becoming (<em>bhava</em>).</p>
<p>When the task is completed the child may want to show others the
finished product so that they can admire the refinement and skill. In
such a case, if an adult who views the finished object expresses
admiration for the accomplishment, expresses a suitable appreciation for
the quality of the object, or encourages the child to improve his or her
skills, this is an appropriate and adequate response. An excessive
amount of admiration, however, in which an appreciation for the child’s
efforts becomes a form of indulging the child, is inappropriate, for
this will transform the child’s enthusiasm into craving – will
transform a wholesome tendency into an unwholesome tendency. This
response may even spoil the child and create bad habits. Whenever
wholesome enthusiasm arises, craving will then arise too; enthusiasm
becomes a fuel for craving. Training children in this way is common. If
a society supports this form of training the number of people who find
happiness through wholesome enthusiasm will decrease, while the number
of people who find pleasure through the gratification of craving will
increase; and the overall state of the society will become more
troubled.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn145">145</a></sup></p>
<p>Children do not only wish to have other people admire the things that
they themselves have created; they also want people to admire other
things that they encounter, regardless of whether these things are
manmade or objects in nature. They wish to share the inherent goodness
and perfection that they witness even in such things as rocks and
pebbles, leaves, and insects. {798} In fact this is a universal
experience: when people witness and recognize the beauty of nature or an
outstanding human achievement, they often want to encourage others to
share this wholesome feeling. By encouraging others they do not seek
personal reward nor do they seek gratification by way of the senses. A
person who sees the true value of the Dhamma has a similar experience;
this appreciation provides the Dhamma with the characteristic of
<em>ehipassiko</em>: inviting one to come and see.</p>
<p>If one is able to rouse ardent enthusiasm and to generate a deep love
for the goodness of an object or the fulfilment of a goal, one will
devote one’s life to this thing. If one’s love is true one will
surrender oneself completely, perhaps even sacrificing one’s life for
that thing. During the Buddha’s time many princes, wealthy merchants,
influential brahmans, and young men and women relinquished their
palaces, wealth, and considerable worldly possessions to go forth and be
ordained, because they developed a love for Dhamma after hearing the
teachings of the Buddha. People who love their work are similar; they
wish to perform and accomplish their work in the best possible way. They
are not distracted by other alluring things or concerned about some form
of reward; their mind is focused, concentrated, and stable, and they
proceed in a steady, consistent way. Concentration arising from
enthusiasm (<em>chanda-samādhi</em>) thus arises, accompanied by supportive
effort (<em>padhāna-saṅkhāra</em>).</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#energy-viriya" id="energy-viriya">Energy (viriya)</a></h4>
<p>Courage, bravery, effort, perseverance, pressing forward, fighting
spirit; not getting discouraged or intimidated by obstacles and
difficulties. When one recognizes something as valuable and worthy of
attainment, if energy has been roused, even if one hears that this thing
can only be achieved with extreme difficulty, the path to its fulfilment
is fraught with obstacles, or it will require months or years to
realize, one is not disheartened; rather, one sees victory and success
in this task as a challenge.</p>
<p>There are many stories in the scriptures of renunciants at the Buddha’s
time who belonged to other sects and who asked for ordination as a
bhikkhu after gaining faith in the Buddha’s teachings. When they
discovered that a candidate who has previously been ordained in another
religious tradition must undergo a form of initiation or test (to live
under ‘probation’ – <em>titthiya-parivāsa</em>) for four months, they were not
discouraged. On the contrary, some of them valiantly submitted
themselves to this examination for four years<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn146">146</a></sup></p>
<p>People lacking energy may also want to achieve success, but when they
hear that such success may take years to achieve, they are already
exhausted and retreat; it is difficult for their spiritual practice to
bear fruit and they tend to be restless and agitated. Energetic people
possess a special force; whether they are working or engaged in Dhamma
practice, their mind is unified and stable, intent upon the goal. There
is concentration arising from energy (<em>viriya-samādhi</em>), accompanied by
supportive effort.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#focused-attention-citta" id="focused-attention-citta">Focused attention (citta)</a></h4>
<p>The mind is absorbed in and focused on an object or an activity; it does
not release the object of attention or become distracted. If one’s mind
is intensely focused on something, one will pay no attention to anything
else. If someone else mentions another subject one will take no interest
in this discussion, but if one’s favoured subject is brought up one will
immediately take a special interest. Occasionally one will be so
immersed in an activity that one pays no attention to one’s physical
needs and attire, loses track of time, and forgets to eat and sleep.
Things may happen in one’s surrounding environment of which one is
completely unaware. {799} This focused attention gives rise to
concentration, which is called concentration arising from focused
attention (<em>citta-samādhi</em>). The mind is established on an activity,
possesses power to engage with it, and is accompanied by supportive
effort.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#investigation-vimaṁsā" id="investigation-vimaṁsā">Investigation (vimaṁsā)</a></h4>
<p>The application of wisdom; contemplation, reasoning, and reflection; an
examination of the imbalances, shortcomings, or defects of one’s
actions; an ability to experiment and to search for ways to adjust and
improve oneself. Here, wisdom guides concentration. Inquisitive people
like to analyze and try things out. Their examinations are of this
nature: ‘What is the cause for this result?’ ‘Why have things happened
in this way?’ ‘This factor has produced this result; if we remove this
factor the result will differ; if we add this other factor instead
things should unfold in this way; if they don’t happen as planned why is
this so? – how can we adjust this?’</p>
<p>In Dhamma practice they reflect in the following manner: ‘What is the
meaning and purpose of this spiritual quality? On which occasions should
it be applied? How is it connected to other qualities?’ ‘My spiritual
practice is not progressing; which spiritual faculties are too weak and
which in excess?’ ‘People in today’s age live under these conditions.
Which spiritual qualities are they lacking? How can I instil these
qualities in them? What aspects of these qualities should I emphasize?’</p>
<p>Such analysis and examination helps to compose the mind, which
constantly keeps close track of the matter at hand. This leads to
concentration, which is called concentration arising from investigation
(<em>vimaṁsā-samādhi</em>). The mind is absorbed in that activity; it is
strong; it does not wander or waver. This concentration is accompanied
by supportive effort, similar to the other factors leading to success.</p>
<p>These four paths to success are mutually supportive and tend to arise in
unison. For example, one may be very enthusiastic about something and be
very energized; with such energy the mind is focused and one pays close
attention; there is then the opportunity for wisdom to be used for
investigation. The separation of these four factors aims to highlight in
different situations which factor is prominent, acting as a catalyst for
the others.</p>
<p>For example, several people may be listening to a Dhamma talk. One
person likes to study the Dhamma and listens with delight in the truth;
she wants to deepen her understanding of the Dhamma (or perhaps simply
takes pleasure in that particular talk or she likes the speaker) and
listens with one-pointed attention. <em>Chanda</em> is thus the predominant
factor and induces concentration along with other virtues. Another
person has a disposition, or simply has a conviction in that moment,
that when facing a necessary task, one must fight and gain victory –
one must confront the task and bring it to completion. He thus sees the
subject matter of the talk as a challenge, as something that must be
understood. In this case <em>viriya</em> is the prevailing factor. Another
person has the disposition of being attentive and responsible; whatever
she engages with she responds and pays attention to. She is thus
determined to follow the presentation of the talk; in this case <em>citta</em>
is the predominant factor. Finally, a fourth person wishes to examine
whether the Dhamma being propounded is true or not, wholesome or not, or
he looks at the logic of the presentation. While listening he
investigates and his mind is one-pointed on the subject of the talk. In
this case <em>vimaṁsā</em> is chief.</p>
<p>There are passages that refer to the four paths to success as the four
governors (<em>adhipati</em>) or the four kinds of sovereignty (<em>adhipateyya</em>),
and they describe the prominent or leading factor in specific
circumstances.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn147">147</a></sup> {800}</p>
<p>The gist of developing concentration in line with the four paths to
success is to take one’s work, activity, or desired goal as the object
of attention, and then to muster enthusiasm, energy, focused attention,
or investigation as a primary support. This will give rise to strong
concentration, which leads to both joy and success.</p>
<p>In Dhamma practice, in the act of studying, or while performing any
other activity, when one wishes for concentration in order to accomplish
the task, one should generate one of the four paths to success as a
leading spiritual factor. Concentration, contentment, and success in
one’s work can then be expected to arise naturally. Moreover, part of a
person’s meditation and spiritual practice will take place in the
classroom, at home, in the fields, at the office, and indeed everywhere.</p>
<p>For example, when a teacher teaches a subject of study, she makes
herself a ‘virtuous friend’ (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>), by helping the pupils see
the value of this branch of knowledge and by revealing how this
knowledge may be beneficial to their lives, say as an aid to finding
work in the future, as a way to move ahead in life, or as profitable in
some other way (here she uses ambition as a means for generating
enthusiasm). Or better than that, she points out the benefits for
everyone, say as a way of helping all human beings (this is ‘pure’
enthusiasm), until the pupils develop a love for learning because they
want to gain this knowledge. This is a way of rousing <em>chanda</em>.</p>
<p>Alternatively, she may speak of this knowledge as something which tests
a person’s awareness, discernment, and capability, stimulating an ardour
for learning, or she discusses the accomplishments of others, producing
a fighting spirit in the pupils. This is a way of rousing <em>viriya</em>.</p>
<p>She may stimulate a sense of responsibility in the pupils, so that they
see the connection and importance of this knowledge to their lives and
to society as a whole, say by pointing out issues of danger and safety.
This way, although the students may not be particularly passionate about
the subject of study, they will take an interest and give their
undivided attention. This is a way of rousing <em>citta</em>.</p>
<p>She may teach using methods of inquiry, experimentation, or reasoning,
say by posing questions or conundrums, which requires the pupils to
apply investigation. Thus the pupils will study in a concentrated way.
This is a method of applying <em>vimaṁsā</em>.</p>
<p>It is even better if the teacher is able to recognize the disposition of
individual students and rouses the specific factor leading to success
which is compatible with his or her disposition; or she may rouse
several factors simultaneously. At the same time, students (or anyone
else engaged in work) who are clever may apply wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) to rouse the paths to success by themselves.</p>
<p>On this subject of success, consider the following passages from the
Pali Canon defining the term <em>iddhi</em>:</p>
<p><em>Iddhi</em> as ‘success’:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>‘Iddhi’ means success, fulfilment, special accomplishment, gain, to
succeed, to succeed well, to accomplish, to attain, to realize, to
bring a specific quality to completion. {801}</p>
<p><em>Vbh. 217.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><em>Iddhi</em> as ‘spiritual power’ (’psychic power’; often as
<em>iddhi-pāṭihāriya</em>):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, what is spiritual power? Here, a monk in this Dhamma and
Discipline performs various kinds of supernormal power: having been
one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and
vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart,
through a mountain as if through space; he dives in and out of the
earth as if it were water; he walks on water without sinking as if it
were earth; he flies through the air like a bird; with his hand he
touches and strokes the sun and the moon, so powerful and mighty; he
exercises mastery with his body even as far as the Brahma world. This
is called spiritual power.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn148">148</a></sup></p>

<p>And what is the path to spiritual power (iddhipāda)? Whatever way,
whatever practice, leads to gaining spiritual power, to realizing
spiritual power, this way and practice is called the path to spiritual
power.</p>
<p>And what is the development of the path to spiritual power? Here, a
bhikkhu develops the path to spiritual power that consists of
concentration due to desire and volitional formations of striving. He
develops the path to spiritual power that consists of concentration
due to energy ... consists of concentration due to focused attention
... consists of concentration due to investigation and volitional

<h3><a class="header" href="#standard-development-of-concentration-meditation-guided-by-mindfulness" id="standard-development-of-concentration-meditation-guided-by-mindfulness">Standard Development of Concentration: Meditation Guided by Mindfulness</a></h3>
<p>In many situations, say in formal study or while working, it is possible
to develop concentration by applying the four factors leading to success
(<em>iddhipāda</em>). Progress or accomplishment in such work or study is set
as the goal of these four factors. Irrespective of whether one applies
the factor of protection, removal, development, or preservation, one
generates an accompanying ‘power of striving’ (<em>padhāna-saṅkhāra</em>),
which propels one towards this goal and supports the establishment of
concentration.</p>
<p>But in everyday life, in which we experience passing sense impressions
and engage with things that are either impassive or existing
independently on their own, it is nearly impossible to establish the
four factors leading to success, or for these factors to operate. In
such situations, the basic quality of the mind required to prepare for
or induce the arising of concentration is mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), because
mindfulness draws and holds attention to sense impressions, those things
a person engages with and those activities which must be performed.
Mindfulness is the mind’s refuge. Once mindfulness has been established
to a suitable degree, wholesome enthusiasm follows automatically.</p>
<p>There are two main methods for developing concentration that rely
primarily on mindfulness:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To train mindfulness for wisdom practice; to aim for the benefits
ensuing from wisdom practice; to use mindfulness as the vanguard for
wisdom; to coordinate mindfulness with wisdom, by having mindfulness
seize specific sense impressions and submit them to wisdom for
contemplation and understanding. In this method of practice,
concentration is not emphasized, but is automatically developed as a
by-product. Moreover, this concentration makes the application of
wisdom more fruitful. This method comprises the main part of the
practice of the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, which was described
earlier in the section on right mindfulness, and it can be referred
to as an everyday or universal meditation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To train mindfulness in order to generate pure concentration; to
give an exclusive emphasis on deep concentration; to hold onto a
sense object with mindfulness, so that attention on that object is
steady and undeviating; to fix attention on an object continuously.
This method of practice gives direct emphasis to concentration.
Although wisdom may sometimes be used it is an accessory to the
process, for example one may simply know that which is being
observed, but one does not intend to penetrate the truth of that
object. This method is the essence of the systematic development of
concentration, discussed below. {803}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="header" href="#systematic-development-of-concentration" id="systematic-development-of-concentration">Systematic Development of Concentration</a></h3>
<p>The systematic development of concentration here refers to meditation
techniques that have been handed down in the Theravada Buddhist
tradition, as recorded and explained in various commentarial texts,
especially in the Visuddhimagga.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn150">150</a></sup> These techniques are practised by
Dhamma practitioners with earnestness and devotion, by aiming
exclusively at ‘pure’ concentration, within the confines of mundane
levels of concentrative attainments.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn151">151</a></sup> They are set down and
classified as a gradual system of practice, beginning with preliminary
preparations, followed by specific techniques of meditation
(<em>kammaṭṭhāna</em>), progressive stages of training, and finally specific
results of practice, including the concentrative attainments
(<em>jhāna-samāpatti</em>) and the mundane higher psychic attainments
(<em>lokiya-abhiññā</em>).</p>
<p>This systematic development of concentration presented in the
commentaries begins with pure or faultless moral conduct. From here, the
main stages of this system can be outlined as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To remove the ten obstructions or causes for anxiety (<em>palibodha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To seek out a ‘virtuous friend’, a teacher, who possesses the
suitable attributes for bestowing a meditation technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To take up one of the forty meditation techniques, suitable to one’s
disposition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To go and stay in a monastery, quiet dwelling, or place of
practice suitable for meditation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To completely eliminate trifling worries and concerns.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The development of concentration (<em>samādhi-bhāvanā</em>): to practise in
accord with this meditation technique.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When presenting the details of these five main stages, the commentators
had monks in mind who make a serious, determined effort to practise
meditation, perhaps for months or years. Laypeople or those who only
intend to practise for a short period should select those aspects
relevant to their circumstances.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#eliminating-the-ten-impediments" id="eliminating-the-ten-impediments">Eliminating the Ten Impediments</a></h3>
<p>The term <em>palibodha</em> refers to mental attachments or impediments, which
cause anxiety and worry. This anxiety obstructs spiritual progress and
makes it difficult for concentration to arise; therefore it should be
dispelled. The scriptures mention ten kinds of <em>palibodha</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dwelling or monastery (<em>āvāsa</em>): one has accumulated many personal
belongings or one has unfinished business, which are a cause for
worry. If one is not overly attached to these things, there is no
problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Family (<em>kula</em>): one’s family of intimate relatives or one’s
‘family’ of supporters; if one is separated from these people one is
concerned about them. One should come to terms with such separation
and dispel the worry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gain; acquisitions (<em>lābha</em>): one is worried, for example, about
one’s many devoted and generous followers, and thus neglects to
pursue one’s Dhamma practice. In such a case one should separate
oneself from these people and seek solitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group (<em>gaṇa</em>): one is, for example, responsible for a group of
disciples; one is preoccupied by teaching them and dispelling their
doubts. In this case one should attend to any unfinished
responsibilities or find someone to act as a replacement and go off
on one’s own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work (<em>kamma</em>), especially building work (<em>navakamma</em>). One should
complete these projects oneself or appoint someone else to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travelling (<em>addhāna</em>): to travel long distances for business
matters, say in order to ordain monks and novices. One should
complete these affairs so as to be free from worry. {804}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relatives (<em>ñāti</em>), both blood relatives and ‘relatives’ in the
monastery (e.g. one’s preceptor, teachers, and disciples). If these
individuals are ill one ought to nurse them and try to restore them
to good health, so that one is relieved of worry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Illness (<em>ābādha</em>): one is ill oneself; one should hasten to find a
cure and regain good health. If the illness appears to be incurable
one should muster an inner strength, by thinking: ‘I am not willing
to be a slave to this illness; I am determined to maintain my
spiritual practice!’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scriptures (<em>gantha</em>): formal study (<em>pariyatti</em>); scholarly
subjects. Such study is an obstacle for those who are anxious about
securing knowledge, for example through frequent recitation. If
there is no anxiety, such study is not a problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychic powers (<em>iddhi</em>), which are a burden for an unawakened
person to protect. They are an obstacle for someone who is
developing insight, not for someone who is developing concentration
and for whom such powers have not yet manifested.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="header" href="#seeking-a-virtuous-friend" id="seeking-a-virtuous-friend">Seeking a Virtuous Friend</a></h3>
<p>When one has removed these obstacles and there are no lingering concerns
in the mind, one should seek out a competent meditation teacher, who is
endowed with virtuous qualities and devoted to helping others. Such a
person is called a ‘virtuous friend’ (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>). He or she
possesses the seven qualities of a virtuous friend:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Endearing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Venerable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspiring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A skilful speaker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A patient listener.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Able to describe profound subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not lead others to useless ends.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn152">152</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally, this virtuous friend should be the Buddha; if this is not
possible, then he or she should be an arahant, an awakened being of a
subordinate level, someone who has attained jhāna, one who has memorized
the Tipiṭaka, or someone who is of great learning (<em>bahussuta</em>),
respectively.</p>
<p>The commentaries claim that occasionally an unawakened person of great
learning is able to teach more effectively than an arahant who is not of
great learning. This is because such arahants are only skilled at the
way of practice that they themselves have passed through and can only
describe their own unique path. Moreover, some arahants are not skilled
at teaching. Those people of great learning have done much research and
have questioned many teachers; they are able to offer a comprehensive
view of practice, are familiar with alternative methods of practice, and
can make suggestions suitable to different individuals. Of course the
optimum is to have an arahant of great learning. When one has found a
‘virtuous friend’, one should approach him or her, perform the
appropriate duties in relation to this person, and then ask for the
opportunity to learn meditation.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#receiving-a-meditation-technique-suitable-to-ones-disposition" id="receiving-a-meditation-technique-suitable-to-ones-disposition">Receiving a Meditation Technique Suitable to One’s Disposition</a></h3>
<p>To begin with let us take a look at the meanings of the Pali terms
<em>kammaṭṭhāna</em> (’meditation technique’) and <em>cariya</em> (’disposition’):</p>
<p><em>Kammaṭṭhāna</em> literally means ‘foundation for mental activity’ or ‘that
which facilitates mental activity’. Technically it means ‘something used
as an object for developing meditation’, ‘means of training the mind’,
or ‘method for inducing concentration’. Simply speaking, it is a focus
for the mind (i.e. a focus for mindfulness – <em>sati</em>). When the mind has
such a focus it is seriously engaged but also tranquil; it does not run
off out of control; it is not distracted or disturbed. The term
<em>kammaṭṭhāna</em> refers to an object of attention inducing concentration,
or to anything that is the focus of the mind and helps to establish
one-pointedness in the quickest and most stable way.</p>
<p>The commentaries describe forty kinds of meditation techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Kasiṇa</em> meditations: ‘meditation objects inducing concentration’.
This is a way of using external objects for unifying the mind. There
are ten such objects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Four great elements (<em>bhūta-kasiṇa</em>): earth (<em>paṭhavī</em>), water
(<em>āpo</em>), fire (<em>tejo</em>), and air (<em>vāyo</em>). {805}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four colours (<em>vaṇṇa-kasiṇa</em>): green (<em>nīla</em>), yellow (<em>pīta</em>),
red (<em>lohita</em>), and white (<em>odāta</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meditation on light (<em>āloka</em>) and meditation on space (<em>ākāsa</em>;
<em>paricchinnākāsa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn153">153</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With these ten meditation objects it is possible to use either
objects found naturally in nature or objects designed specifically
for such an exercise; the latter is more common.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ten meditations on foulness (<em>asubha</em>): to contemplate a corpse in
ten stages of decay, beginning with a bloated corpse and ending with
a bare skeleton. (See
Note <a href="#note-asubha-meditations">Asubha Meditations</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ten recollections (<em>anussati</em>): virtuous objects of attention which
should be frequently called to mind:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn154">154</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Recollection of the Buddha and the Buddha’s virtues
(<em>buddhānussati</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recollection of the Dhamma and the Dhamma’s virtues
(<em>dhammānussati</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recollection of the Sangha and the Sangha’s virtues
(<em>saṅghānussati</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recollection of virtuous conduct (<em>sīlānussati</em>): to reflect on
one’s own pure moral conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recollection of generosity (<em>cāgānussati</em>): to reflect on the
gifts one has donated and to recognize one’s own virtuous
qualities of generosity and renunciation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recollection of divinity (<em>devānussati</em>): to reflect on divine
beings (<em>devatā</em>) which one has encountered or about which one
has heard, and to discern one’s own inherent virtues which lead
to a celestial rebirth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recollection on death (<em>maraṇassati</em>): to reflect on one’s own
inescapable mortality; such reflection gives rise to
heedfulness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recollection of the body (<em>kāyagatā-sati</em>); mindfulness of the
body: to reflect on the body and to see that it is comprised of
various organs, notably the thirty-two parts, which are unclean,
unattractive, and loathsome. This recollection leads to a
knowledge of the true nature of the body and prevents
infatuation with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mindfulness of in- and out-breathing (<em>ānāpānasati</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recollection on peace (<em>upasamānussati</em>): recollection on
Nibbāna; to reflect on the attributes of Nibbāna, as a state
free from agitation, defilement, and suffering. {806}</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four unbounded states of mind (<em>appamaññā</em>): the qualities to be
radiated outwards towards all beings without exception, in an
unlimited, immeasurable way. Most often these states are known as
the four ‘divine abidings’ (<em>brahmavihāra</em>; ‘excellent abidings’,
‘pure abidings’, ‘qualities of person with an expansive, noble
mind’):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn155">155</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>): well-wishing, friendliness, the desire
for all beings to experience happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>): the desire to help others be free from
suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sympathetic joy (<em>muditā</em>): a matching joy and delight when
another person is well and happy, prosperous and successful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>): to make one’s mind steady, calm, and
unbiased, like a set of scales; to discern how all people
receive good and bad results according to relevant causes and
conditions; to not be prejudiced by likes and dislikes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perception of the loathsomeness of food
(<em>āhārepaṭikūla-saññā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn156">156</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Analysis of the four elements (<em>catudhātu-vavaṭṭhāna</em>): to discern
one’s own body as consisting solely of the four main elements:
earth, water, fire, and air.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn157">157</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four absorptions of the formless sphere (<em>arūpa</em>; <em>āruppa</em>): to take
one of the formless states as one’s object of attention. This
meditation is only possible for someone who practises one of the
first nine <em>kasiṇa</em> meditations and who has achieved the fourth
jhāna:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn158">158</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To focus on infinite space (<em>ākāsānañcāyatana</em>), which is
achieved by withdrawing attention from the <em>kasiṇa</em> object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To focus on infinite consciousness (<em>viññāṇañcāyatana</em>); to stop
paying attention to space and instead to pay attention to
consciousness, which pervades space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To focus on the sphere of nothingness (<em>ākiñcaññāyatana</em>), by
setting aside consciousness as the object of attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To enter the state of neither-perception-nor-non-perception
(<em>nevasaññānāsaññāyatana</em>), by ceasing to focus even on the
sphere of nothingness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Occasionally, the aforementioned meditation techniques are classified
into two groups:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn159">159</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Meditations applicable to all situations (<em>sabbatthaka-kammaṭṭhāna</em>;
‘beneficial to all situations’): meditations which all people should
practise regularly: that is, lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>) and
recollection on death (<em>maraṇassati</em>). Occasionally, the
contemplation on foulness (<em>asubha-saññā</em>) is also included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meditations requiring supervision (<em>pārihāriya-kammaṭṭhāna</em>):
meditations suitable to an individual’s unique disposition; when one
undertakes such a meditation technique, one needs to continually
safeguard it so that it acts as the foundation for higher levels of
spiritual practice. {807}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Asubha Meditations</span><a id="note-asubha-meditations"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In today’s day and age it is obviously difficult for people to
practise these ten contemplations. In full, they are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>uddhumātaka</em> (a bloated corpse);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>vinīlaka</em> (a bluish, discoloured corpse);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>vipubbaka</em> (a festering corpse);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>vicchiddaka</em> (a corpse split into two);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>vikkhāyitaka</em> (a corpse gnawed by animals);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>vikkhittaka</em> (a severed and scattered corpse);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>hatavikkhittaka</em> (a hacked and mangled corpse);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>lohitaka</em> (a blood-stained corpse);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>puḷuvaka</em> (a worm-infested corpse); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>aṭṭhika</em> (a skeleton).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Pali Canon these contemplations are classified as ‘perceptions’
(<em>saññā</em>): Ps. I. 95; Dhs. 55.</p>
<p>In the Sutta Piṭaka only five (combined with other factors, e.g.:
S. V. 131; A. I. 41-42; A. V. 106-107) or six (e.g.: D. III. 226;
A. II. 16-17) of these contemplations are mentioned; the closest
resemblance to these ten contemplations are the nine cemetery
contemplations (<em>nava-sīvathikā</em>) in the teaching on the Foundations
of Mindfulness (<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em>) or in the teaching on mindfulness of
the body (<em>kāyagatā-sati</em>) – e.g.: D. II. 295-6; M. I. 58; M. III.
91; A. III. 324.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The commentaries state that these forty meditation techniques are
distinguished by how suitable they are for different individuals. People
should select a technique appropriate to their character and
inclination, referred to here as dis-position (<em>cariya</em>). If one chooses
an appropriate technique, meditation practice will be swift and
successful; if one chooses an inappropriate technique, practice may be
slow and ineffective.</p>
<p><em>Cariya</em> literally means ‘ordinary behaviour’. It refers to a person’s
normal temperament, underlying character, and proclivities. The term
<em>carita</em> (’character’, ‘demeanour’) is used in reference to a person who
possesses such behaviour and temperament. A person whose behaviour is
dictated by greed, for example, is labelled as having a ‘greedy
character’ (<em>rāga-carita</em>). There are six major character types:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn160">160</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Rāga-carita</em>: people whose normal behaviour is governed by greed,
whose temperament is predominantly greedy, who incline towards
beauty and elegance. Such people should use the counter meditation
on foulness – <em>asubha</em> – as well as recollection of the body –
<em>kāyagatā-sati</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dosa-carita</em>: people whose normal behaviour is governed by anger,
whose temperament is predominantly angry, who are acutely hot-headed
and irritable. The appropriate meditation technique for such people
is lovingkindness – <em>mettā</em> (and including the other three pure
abidings – <em>brahmavihāra</em>). Also apt are the <em>kasiṇa</em> meditations,
especially those using colours – <em>vaṇṇa-kasiṇa</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Moha-carita</em>: people whose normal behaviour is governed by
delusion, whose temperament is predominantly deluded, who are
primarily influenced by ignorance, listlessness, confusion, and
credulity. Such people believe whatever they are told by others.
This tendency should be rectified through study, inquiry, listening
to Dhamma, Dhamma discussion, or living with a teacher. A supportive
meditation is mindfulness of breathing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Saddhā-carita</em>: people whose normal behaviour is governed by faith,
whose temperament is predominantly devout, who are primarily
influenced by inspiration, delight, and devotion. Such people should
be directed towards truly noble things and towards meaningful
reflections, for example a recollection on the virtue of the Triple
Gem and on their own moral rectitude. Also suitable are the first
six of the ten recollections – <em>anussati</em> – see above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Buddhi-carita</em> (or <em>ñāṇa-carita</em>): people whose normal behaviour is
governed by knowledge, who are predominantly inclined towards
contemplation and discernment of the truth. These people should be
encouraged to engage in reflections on nature or on virtue which
increase wisdom, for example to reflect on the Three
Characteristics. Appropriate meditation techniques include
recollection on death, recollection on peace, analysis of the four
elements, and perception on the loathsomeness of food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vitakka-carita</em>: people whose normal behaviour is governed by
thinking, who are predominantly inclined towards convoluted thinking
and incoherent reasoning. This should be rectified by using methods,
e.g. mindfulness of breathing (or the <em>kasiṇa</em> meditations), which
restrain this tendency.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The behaviour of these different character types differs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When those of a greedy character (<em>rāga-carita</em>) encounter
something, their mind seizes onto its good or admirable qualities;
they are impressed by these qualities and overlook any faults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mind of angry character types (<em>dosa-carita</em>), on the other
hand, collides with any minor fault or deficiency, even if the
object at hand possesses many good qualities; they get caught up in
aversion before considering the merits of the object. {808}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those whose character is governed by contemplation (<em>buddhi-carita</em>)
are similar to angry character types in so far as they tend not to
become infatuated with anything. Contemplative types look for faults
that exist but are able to dismiss them; angry character types,
however, look for faults or discredit an object, even if these
faults are nonexistent, and turn away from the object with aversion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those of deluded character (<em>moha-carita</em>) see things with a lack of
clarity and tend towards apathy; instead of understanding things for
themselves, they follow the opinions of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those governed by thinking (<em>vitakka-carita</em>) reflect in a desultory
way: they first think of the merits of something, then think of the
faults, but are confused and indecisive, not knowing which way to
go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those with a devout character (<em>saddhā-carita</em>) are similar to
greedy characters in so far as they tend to see the merits of an
object, but having recognized these merits they rejoice in them
rather than become infatuated like a greedy person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, people tend to possess a mixture of these character types,
for example greed mixed with excessive thinking, or anger mixed with a
contemplative streak. Besides choosing a meditation object that is
appropriate to one’s character and disposition, the scriptures also
encourage people to choose suitable and supportive conditions
(<em>sappāya</em>) in regards to other things, like dwelling, climate, food,
personal belongings, and resort.</p>
<p>Besides the factor of suitability in relation to various character
types, the forty meditation techniques also differ in regard to results:
they lead to different levels of concentration (see the diagram below).</p>
<p>In regard to taking up a meditation practice the commentaries suggest
following a formal procedure. After the student approaches a teacher or
‘virtuous friend’:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The student should make a declaration dedicating himself to the
Buddha, in such a manner: ‘Blessed One, I relinquish myself to
you.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn161">161</a></sup> Or he surrenders himself to a teacher: ‘Venerable
teacher, I relinquish myself to you.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn162">162</a></sup> This self-surrender is a
way of generating a sense of sincerity and determination in
practice. It dispels anxiety, creates a feeling of warmth between
teacher and pupil, and allows the teacher to assist in the best way
possible. The student should establish the qualities of non-greed,
non-hatred, non-delusion, renunciation, desire for solitude, and
desire for liberation in the mind, as well as aspiring to
concentration and to Nibbāna. At this point he should ask for a
meditation technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the teacher possesses the ability to read minds, he should use
this power to determine the student’s disposition. If he does not
have this ability he should make inquiries, for example: ‘What sort
of character are you?’ ‘What are your predominant traits, emotions,
and thought patterns?’ ‘What sort of contemplations make you feel at
ease?’ ‘What meditation techniques do you incline towards?’ The
teacher then selects a meditation technique suitable to the
student’s disposition, explains how to begin meditating, how to
sustain the focus, and how to develop the meditation, explains the
nature of mental ‘signs’ (<em>nimitta</em>), the various stages of
concentration, and the way to protect and to empower concentration.

<h3><a class="header" href="#finding-a-fixed-abode" id="finding-a-fixed-abode">Finding a Fixed Abode</a></h3>
<p>To live in a monastery suitable for meditation practice. Ideally, one
should live in the same monastery as one’s teacher, but if this is
inconvenient one should find a residence that is suitable and supportive
to meditation.</p>
<p>The commentaries mention eighteen unfavourable monasteries or dwellings,
with the following features: it is large (a monastery in which monks
have divergent interests and opinions, in which there are many troubles,
and which is not peaceful); it is new (a monastery in which one gets
caught up in building projects); it is dilapidated (it requires a lot of
upkeep); it is next to a road (where there are many visitors); it has a
stone-lined pond (where many people congregate); it contains plants with
edible leaves; it contains flowering bushes; it contains fruit trees (in
the case of these last three factors, people will likely be a
disturbance, by say cutting flowers or asking for fruit); it is famous
(e.g. people believe there is an exceptional monk residing here and will
gather in large numbers); it is near a city; it is situated among timber
trees; it is near arable fields (i.e. it is near where people work); the
monastery contains incompatible, troublesome people; it is near a pier
or transport station; it is in a remote area (where people have no faith
in Buddhism); it is on the frontier (between two powerful nations; it
may be dangerous); it has unsuitable features (it contains
disturbances); it is absent of virtuous companions.</p>
<p>An appropriate monastery or dwelling contains five attributes: (1) it is
neither too close nor too far; it is convenient to come and go; (2)
during the day it is not crowded; during the night it is not noisy; (3)
it is free of biting insects, intrusive creatures, and extreme weather
conditions; (4) it is a place where one does not lack the four
requisites; (5) there is an elder residing there who is well-versed in
the Dhamma and is able to offer guidance.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn164">164</a></sup></p>
<p>To dispel minor worries and concerns regarding one’s body and one’s
everyday personal belongings; to not allow these things to disturb the
mind. For example, one gives attention to shaving, clipping one’s nails,
sewing and dying one’s robes, and keeping one’s lodging clean. {811}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#general-practice-of-meditation" id="general-practice-of-meditation">General Practice of Meditation</a></h3>
<p>In regard to practising a specific meditation technique, each technique
has unique details and methods of practice. It is possible, however, to
give a general outline for the development of concentration. One such
outline found in the scriptures is the classification into three stages
of training or development: initial development (<em>parikamma-bhāvanā</em>),
access concentration development (<em>upacāra-bhāvanā</em>), and attainment
concentration development (<em>appanā-bhāvanā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn165">165</a></sup></p>
<p>Before describing these three stages of development, it is important to
explain the Pali term <em>nimitta</em>. A <em>nimitta</em> is a mental sign used for
concentration, or it is a mental image representing the object used in
meditation. There are three such signs, classified in order of level of
achievement (see the diagram above):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Parikamma-nimitta</em>: preparatory or initial sign. Any object that is
used as the focus of meditation, for example: to gaze at a <em>kasiṇa</em>
disc, to focus on the breath, or to reflect on the Buddha’s virtues
and to recognize that some of these virtues exist in one’s own
mind.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn166">166</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Uggaha-nimitta</em>: a ‘learning sign’; a sign taken up by the mind or
impressed on the mind. This refers to the preparatory sign
(<em>parikamma-nimitta</em>) – the meditation object – which has been
focused or reflected on to the point of precise discernment, where a
person develops a vivid mental impression of the object. For
example, one focuses on a <em>kasiṇa</em> disc until this impression is
imprinted in the mind and visible even with the eyes shut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paṭibhāga-nimitta</em>: a virtual, counterpart, or approximate sign.
This image is similar to the ‘learning sign’, but is more deeply
impressed on the mind, to the point where it arises out of the
perception (<em>saññā</em>) of the person in a state of concentration. It
is pure (for example, free from any colour) and stainless, and the
person is able to expand or contract any aspect of this image at
will.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first two kinds of <em>nimitta</em> are accessible through all meditation
techniques, but the third kind (<em>paṭibhāga-nimitta</em>) is only accessible
through the twenty-two techniques which have a material object as a
focus, that is: the ten <em>kasiṇa</em> meditations, the ten meditations on
foulness, recollection on the body, and mindfulness of breathing.</p>
<p>The term <em>bhāvanā</em>, meaning ‘cultivation’, refers to practising a
meditation technique or to developing concentration. The three stages of
concentration development are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Initial stage of development (<em>parikamma-bhāvanā</em>): to focus on and
obtain a preliminary image of a meditation object; for example, one
gazes at a <em>kasiṇa</em> disc, focuses on the in- and out-breathing at
the tip of the nose, or reflects on the Buddha’s virtues inherent in
oneself. Simply speaking, one focuses on the preparatory sign
(<em>parikamma-nimitta</em>) – on the meditation object. When one sustains
this focus to the point of gaining an accurate mental impression of
the object, a ‘learning sign’ (<em>uggaha-nimitta</em>) arises. The mind
attains an initial stage of concentration, which is called
‘preparatory concentration’ (<em>parikamma-samādhi</em>) or ‘momentary
concentration’ (<em>khaṇika-samādhi</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access development (<em>upacāra-bhāvanā</em>): one relies on preparatory
concentration to sustain one’s focus on the learning sign, until
this sign becomes firmly established in the mind and there arises a
counterpart sign (<em>paṭibhāga-nimitta</em>). The mental hindrances
(<em>nīvaraṇa</em>) subside (with meditation techniques not focusing on a
material object, there is no counterpart sign; one simply reflects
on the meditation object and concentrates on it until the hindrances
subside). The mind is established in access concentration
(<em>upacāra-samādhi</em>). This is the highest stage of ‘sense sphere
concentration’ (<em>kāmāvacara-samādhi</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attainment development (<em>appanā-bhāvanā</em>): one continually
cultivates the counterpart sign while in access concentration,
protecting it so that it does not fade or disappear, by avoiding
unsuitable places, people, and food, and by associating with
suitable things. (See
Note <a href="#note-seven-supports">Seven Supporting Conditions</a>) One knows which methods help to
generate attainment concentration, for example by sustaining one’s
focus in an optimal way.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn167">167</a></sup> In the end a person reaches
attainment concentration (<em>appanā-samādhi</em>) and enters the first
jhāna, which is the initial stage of ‘fine-material concentration’
(<em>rūpāvacara-samādhi</em>). {812}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Seven Supporting Conditions</span><a id="note-seven-supports"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are seven <em>sappāya</em> (suitable, favourable, and supportive
conditions):</p>

<li>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With many meditation techniques the object of meditation is extremely
subtle. There is no material object to focus on or to contact physically
and thus the image of this object does not become clear enough: the mind
is unable to be concentrated and absorbed for long. Such techniques do
not give rise to a counterpart sign and only lead to the level of access
concentration. With techniques using a coarse meditation object, which
can be seen clearly and physically contacted, on the other hand, the
mind can be concentrated for a long period of time. These techniques
give rise to a counterpart sign and lead to attainment concentration. An
exception to this is the meditation on the four unbounded states of mind
(<em>appamaññā</em>) – the divine abidings (<em>brahmavihāra</em>). This meditation
does not use a distinct material object as a focus for attention, and
thus does not give rise to a counterpart sign, but because sentient
beings are the focus of attention, this meditation provides a clear
enough image to lead to attainment concentration.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn168">168</a></sup></p>
<p>With the attainment of the first jhāna, the next step is to develop
proficiency in regard to the first jhāna,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn169">169</a></sup> and to make effort in
order to attain the other jhānas in turn, within the limits of
attainment possible by each specific meditation technique. In this way a
person realizes the appropriate fruits of tranquillity meditation
(<em>samatha</em>).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#mindfulness-of-breathing-as-an-example-of-meditation-practice" id="mindfulness-of-breathing-as-an-example-of-meditation-practice">Mindfulness of Breathing As an Example of Meditation Practice</a></h3>
<p>Having described general principles of meditation practice, it seems
appropriate now to give an example of how to develop a specific
technique. Of the forty meditation techniques, the one chosen here is
the meditation on in- and out-breathing (<em>ānāpānasati</em>).</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#special-attributes-of-mindfulness-of-breathing" id="special-attributes-of-mindfulness-of-breathing">Special Attributes of Mindfulness of Breathing</a></h4>
<p>There are many reasons for choosing the meditation on breathing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a very convenient method for developing concentration as it
uses the breathing, which is a natural part of every person’s life.
This meditation can be practised at any time and in any place; it is
not necessary to prepare any meditation tools as is the case for
<em>kasiṇa</em> meditation. It uses a material object (the breath) as its
object of attention, which is adequately clear for the mind’s focus;
the breath is not as subtle as those immaterial phenomena used in
other meditation techniques which must be brought to mind by way of
perception (<em>saññā</em>). This practice is also very simple and does not
require an analysis of phenomena as is the case with say a
meditation on the elements; all a person needs to do is be mindful
and focus on the breath. Those people whose minds are tired from
thinking a lot can practise mindfulness of breathing without
difficulty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person derives benefits from this practice from the very start;
one needs not wait until one achieves specific levels of
concentration. The body becomes relaxed and rested, and the mind
experiences progressively deeper levels of peace. Unskilful mental
states are eliminated and skilful states are enhanced. {813}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This meditation is not detrimental to physical health, as confirmed
by the Buddha’s own experience: <em>When I dwelled frequently in this
abiding [of concentration by mindfulness of breathing] my body was
not fatigued, my eyes were not tired</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn170">170</a></sup> This is unlike other
meditation techniques which entail standing, walking, or gazing at a
meditation object. On the contrary, meditation on breathing improves
a person’s physical health, by providing the body with an
opportunity to rest, and by balancing, regulating, and refining the
entire system of breathing.</p>
<p>Think of someone who is running or climbing a hill, or someone who
is frightened or angry – his breathing will be more rapid than
normal. Sometimes breathing through the nose is not enough and the
person needs to breathe through the mouth as well. On the other
hand, the breathing of someone whose body is relaxed and whose mind
is at ease is more subtle and fine.</p>
<p>Mindfulness of breathing calms the body and mind and gradually
refines the breath, to the point were the breath becomes almost
imperceptible. The body then is in a state of wellbeing and relies
on a minimal amount of energy consumption. The body is refreshed,
the aging process is slowed down, and a person is able to work more
while at the same time requiring less rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is one of only twelve types of meditation which result in the
highest level of concentration – the fourth jhāna – and lead to
the formless jhānas, up to the attainment of cessation
(<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>). Mindfulness of breathing is considered a
cardinal and complete form of meditation; one does not need to worry
about finding another technique to alternate or combine with it.
This is confirmed by the Buddha:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, if a monk wishes: ‘May I enter and dwell in the fourth
jhāna’ ... he should closely attend to this same concentration by
mindfulness of breathing. If a monk wishes: ‘May I completely
transcend the base of nothingness, and enter and dwell in the base of
neither-perception-nor-nonperception’.... ‘May I completely transcend
the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception and enter and dwell
in the cessation of perception and feeling’, he should closely attend
to this same concentration by mindfulness of breathing.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn171">171</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 318-19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It can be used for both tranquillity meditation (<em>samatha</em>) and for
insight meditation (<em>vipassanā</em>). One can practise mindfulness of
breathing with the sole wish of reaching concentrative attainments,
or one can use it as a basis for developing all four foundations of
mindfulness. It fully enables a concentrated mind to be the ‘field
of practice’ for wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn172">172</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a way of developing concentration highly praised by the
Buddha, who often encouraged the monks to practise mindfulness of
breathing. The Buddha himself often applied this practice as a
mental abiding (<em>vihāra-dhamma</em>), both before and after his
awakening:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, this concentration by mindfulness of breathing when developed
and cultivated, is peaceful and sublime, a refreshing, pleasant
abiding, and it dispels and quells right on the spot evil unwholesome
states whenever they arise. Just as in the last month of the hot
season, when a mass of dust and dirt has swirled up, a great rain
cloud out of season disperses it and quells it on the spot, so too
concentration by mindfulness of breathing ... dispels and quells on
the spot evil unwholesome states whenever they arise. {814}</p>
<p><em>Vin. III. 70; S. V. 321-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, speaking rightly, one should say that concentration by
mindfulness of breathing is a noble abiding (ariya-vihāra), a divine
abiding (brahma-vihāra), the Tathāgata’s abiding (tathāgata-vihāra).
Those monks who are trainees, who have not attained the fruit of
arahantship, who aspire to unsurpassed security and wellbeing
(yogakkhema): for them concentration by mindfulness of breathing, when
developed and cultivated, leads to the destruction of the taints.
Those monks who are arahants, whose taints are destroyed ...: for them
concentration by mindfulness of breathing, when developed and
cultivated, leads to a pleasant abiding in the present moment and to
mindfulness and clear comprehension.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn173">173</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 326.</em></p>
<p>Monks, it so happened that before my awakening, while I was still a
bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, I frequently dwelled in this
abiding [of concentration by mindfulness of breathing]. While I
frequently dwelt in this abiding, neither my body nor my eyes became
fatigued and my mind, by not clinging, was liberated from the taints.
Therefore, monks, if a monk wishes: ‘May neither my body nor my eyes
become fatigued and may my mind, by not clinging, be liberated from
the taints’, this same concentration by mindfulness of breathing
should be closely attended to.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn174">174</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 317.</em></p>
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in the Icchānaṅgala Wood
near the town of Icchānaṅgala. There the Blessed One addressed the
monks thus: ‘Monks, I wish to go into seclusion for three months. I
should not be approached by anyone except for the monk who brings me
almsfood....’ Then, when those three months had passed, the Blessed
One emerged from seclusion and addressed the monks thus: ‘Monks, if
wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘In what abiding did the ascetic
Gotama primarily dwell during the rains residence?’ – being asked
thus, you should answer those wanderers thus: ‘During the rains
residence, friends, the Blessed One dwelt primarily in the
concentration by mindfulness of breathing.’</p>

<p>For passages explaining how to use mindfulness of breathing to further
develop the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, see e.g.: M. III. 83-4;
S. V. 323-5. The commentaries refer to this complete sequence of
<em>ānāpānasati</em> as ‘mindfulness of breathing meditation with sixteen
factors’ (<em>soḷasavatthuka-ānāpānasati-kammaṭṭhāna</em>), dividing it into
four tetrads, as seen above. See: Vism. 266-7.</p>
<p>Some scholars point out the difference between <em>ānāpānasati</em> and ways
of training the breath as found in other doctrines, for example the
yogic control of the breath called pranayama (<em>prāṇayāma</em>), showing
that these are completely distinct.</p>
<p>In particular, <em>ānāpānasati</em> is a way of cultivating mindfulness, not
a way of training the breath; the breath is merely an instrument for
cultivating mindfulness. Some of the methods of controlling the breath
fall under the practice of extreme asceticism, which the Buddha
performed before his awakening and later renounced.</p>

<p>Here, I will explain the practice in brief, limited to the development
of tranquillity (<em>samatha</em>) within the first tetrad – the first group
of four factors.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn178">178</a></sup> {817}</p>

<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Location: if one wishes to practise meditation in earnest one should
first seek out a quiet and secluded place, which is free from loud
noises and other disturbing sense impressions. (See
Note <a href="#note-breathing-hard">Difficulty of Ānāpānasati</a>) Finding such a supportive
environment for practice is especially important for beginners of
meditation. This is similar to someone who is learning how to swim
– one will begin by using flotation devices and swim in still,
non-turbulent water. If one faces unavoidable disturbances, however,
or if one is engaged in a specific activity requiring a certain
level of disruption, then one should do one’s best under the
circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sitting posture: the main principle here is to find a sitting
posture affording the greatest degree of physical relaxation and
ease. One should choose whichever posture leads to a minimum level
of fatigue, even when sitting for long periods of time, and which
allows the breathing to be smooth and comfortable. The sitting
posture which countless meditation masters have verified to be the
best is the lotus posture. This posture is very stable and balanced:
the upper body is held erect and the ends of the eighteen vertebrae
are aligned. Body tissues and tendons are not twisted and breathing
is smooth. The body of a person skilled at this posture feels light
and unburdened; he or she can remain in this position for
exceptionally long periods without feeling discomfort. This is
conducive to concentration; a person’s meditation does not falter
but rather progresses steadily.</p>
<p>The traditional way of explaining this posture is to place one’s
ankles up against the lower abdomen. One can either overlap both
legs (full lotus) or lift one’s right leg on top of one’s left leg
(half lotus). One places one’s hands by one’s lower abdomen, with
the right hand on top of the left, either touching the tips of one’s
two thumbs together or touching one’s right index finger to the tip
of one’s left thumb. Many of these details depend on the physical
balance of individual people. It is to the advantage of beginners if
they can train in this posture, but if it is too uncomfortable they
can sit upright in a chair or choose another suitable posture. The
teachings reiterate that if one is sitting with chronic tension and
physical stress, then something is wrong, and one should rectify the
situation before proceeding. In regards to meditating with one’s
eyes open or closed, it depends on what gives a sense of ease and
does not lead to distraction. If one keeps one’s eyes open, then one
can look down at the ground or perhaps at the tip of one’s nose,
depending on what feels comfortable. (See

</li>
</ul>
<p>When one is sitting at ease, before starting to meditate, many teachers
recommend breathing in deeply and slowly, filling one’s lungs two or
three times and generating a sense of inner spaciousness and clarity.
Then one is ready to focus on the breath.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Difficulty of Ānāpānasati</span><a id="note-breathing-hard"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The commentators consider <em>ānāpānasati</em> to be a hard and difficult
practice. They add that <em>ānāpānasati</em> is the apex of meditation
techniques, the exclusive meditative domain of Buddhas, Silent
Buddhas, and ‘sons of the Buddha’ (<em>buddha-putta</em>; bhikkhus or
arahants) who are considered ‘great men’ (<em>mahāpurisa</em>). It is not a
trifling matter nor can inferior people develop it. If one does not
leave noisy places it is very difficult to practise <em>ānāpānasati</em>
because load noise is the adversary to jhāna. Moreover, formidable
mindfulness and wisdom is required for advanced stages of this
meditation. The commentators cite the Buddha’s words at M. III. 83-4
for corroboration: <em>Bhikkhus, I do not recommend the meditation on
breathing for those with addled mindfulness and a lack of clear
comprehension</em> (see: Vism. 268-9, 284). The commentators’ remarks on
the distinction and difficulty of <em>ānāpānasati</em>, however, raise the
question of why they also recommend this meditation for people
possessing a delusion character (<em>moha-carita</em>).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Posture for Ānāpānasati</span><a id="note-posture-anapanasati"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ānāpānasati</em> is the only meditation technique of all the different
techniques mentioned in the Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta in which there is a
specific instruction on posture – on how to sit (see also:
Kāyagatāsati Sutta – M. III. 88-99; Girimānanda Sutta – A. V.
108-12).</p>
<p>In relation to the other meditation techniques, the posture is
determined suitable for the circumstances. If sitting is recommended,
then this is because sitting is suitable for that activity, and when
the specific posture of sitting cross-legged is deemed optimal for
that practice then this posture becomes the accepted norm. This is the
case say for <em>kasiṇa</em> meditation and lengthy reflections on mind
objects.</p>
<p>It is similar to the activity of writing a book – generally speaking,
sitting is more suited to this activity than standing or lying down.
One should avoid the misunderstanding that sitting is somehow
equivalent to developing concentration. In other words, the lotus
posture is the best posture for maintaining good health and for
engaging in meditation. When one needs to sit in order to perform an
activity the Buddha recommended the lotus posture (this is also true
for sitting in order to contemplate, rest, converse with others, or
develop self-restraint; see, e.g.: M. II. 139-40; M. III. 238; A. II.
38; Ud. 21). Similarly, the Buddha recommended to lie down in the
‘lion posture’, to lie down on the right side, or, when one is alone,
to do walking meditation (<em>caṅkamana</em>: walking up and down).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Commencing Meditation on the Breath</strong></p>
<p>The commentators present some additional meditation methods to
supplement the Buddha’s instructions described above:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Counting (<em>gaṇanā</em>): when beginning to pay attention to the long
and short in- and out-breaths, the commentators recommend counting the
breaths as well, for this will help keep the mind focused. Counting is
separated into two stages:</p>
<p>In the first stage one counts slowly and in a relaxed way. The
recommended tactic or strategy here is to count to not less than five
and to not more than ten, and to count the numbers in order. (If one
counts to less than five the mind is agitated by the short interval of
time; if one counts to more than ten the mind is anxious about counting
rather than staying with the breath; and if one counts in a disconnected
manner the mind gets confused.) One counts the in- and out-breaths in
pairs: out-breath 1, in-breath 1, out-breath 2, in-breath 2, until one
reaches 5-5. Then one begins again: 1-1, until one reaches 6-6, and
begins again. One keeps adding another pair until one reaches 10-10, and
then one returns to the original five pairs, in a repeated cycle:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn179">179</a></sup></p>
<p>1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5</p>
<p>1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, 6-6</p>
<p>1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, 6-6, 7-7</p>
<p>1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, 6-6, 7-7, 8-8</p>
<p>1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, 6-6, 7-7, 8-8, 9-9</p>
<p>1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, 6-6, 7-7, 8-8, 9-9, 10-10</p>
<p>1-1, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5</p>
<p>etc. {819}</p>
<p>In the second stage one counts in quicker succession: when the in- and
out-breaths are clearly evident (when attention rests with the breathing
and does not get dispersed outwards) one ceases to count using the same
number twice as described above and one begins to count single numbers.
Here, one does not need to pay attention to the entire process of
breathing – one focuses only on the breath as it reaches the tip of the
nostrils. First, one counts from one to five, then from one to six,
adding another number in each sequence until one reaches ten; then one
returns to counting from one to five. Counting in this way, one’s
meditation will be more connected, as if it has no gaps. One keeps one’s
attention solely on the spot where the breath makes contact, either at
the tip of the nostrils or at the upper lip (wherever there is a clear
sensation).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn180">180</a></sup> The counting can be illustrated thus:</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</p>
<p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>One counts in this way until one reaches a point where, although one has
ceased counting, mindfulness is still firmly established on the breath.
(Firmly established mindfulness is the objective of counting – to sever
the stream of restless, incoherent thoughts.)</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Taking note (<em>anubandhanā</em>): when attention is established on the
breath, one stops counting and mindfully takes note of the breath in an
uninterrupted stream. ‘Taking note’ here does not mean following the
breath with attention through its various stages of beginning, middle,
and end: as it passes through the nose, travels through the upper chest,
and reaches the navel, and then returns from the belly area to the chest
and finally out through the nose. If one does this the body and mind
will become agitated and the practice will be ineffective. The correct
way to take note is to mindfully observe the breath at the point of
contact (at the tip of the nostrils or at the upper lip).</p>
<p>It is similar to cutting a log with a long saw: one keeps attention
fixed on the point where the teeth of the saw meet the wood and one thus
witnesses the coming and going of the saw. One does not glance from one
end of the saw to the other as it moves. Although one keeps attention
only at the point of contact, one is fully aware of the complete motion
of the saw and by these means one succeeds in the task. This is the same
for a meditator: when one establishes attention at the point of breath’s
contact, and refrains from following the complete circuit of the breath,
one is fully aware of the cycle of breathing and one’s practice bears
fruit. {820}</p>
<p>At this stage, some people will soon have a mental image (<em>nimitta</em>)
arise and they will quickly reach attainment concentration. For others
the process will be more gradual: from the time of counting the breath,
the breath will become increasingly refined, the body will become
exceptionally relaxed, and both the mind and body will feel light, as if
one is floating in space. When a coarse level of breathing ceases, the
person will retain a mental image of the refined breath as an object of
attention. And even when this mental image fades away, new mental images
of successively more refined levels of breath remain in the mind. This
is similar to when a person strikes a bell or a gong with a rod and
produces a loud noise: a long-lasting, reverberating sound remains as a
mental impression or ‘mental sign’ (<em>nimitta</em>). At first this ‘sign’ is
coarse, and then becomes gradually more faint.</p>
<p>At this point, however, a difficulty arises specific to the meditation
on breath: unlike with other meditation techniques, in which the more
one focuses the clearer the meditation object becomes, here, the more
one develops this meditation the more refined the breath becomes, until
the sensation of breathing completely disappears. There is thus no
longer an object on which to focus. When this phenomenon occurs the
commentaries advise against getting worried and breaking off the
meditation, but rather to retrieve the breath. Retrieving the breath is
not difficult. One need not go off in search of it; simply establishing
mindfulness at the usual point of contact is enough. One reflects: ‘The
breath makes contact with the body here; soon it will reappear.’ By
continuing this focus in an uninterrupted way a mental image will soon
appear. (See
Note <a href="#note-stages-attention">Stages of Attention</a>)</p>
<p>Mental images or signs (<em>nimitta</em>) appear differently for different
people. Some people experience it as similar to cotton wool or kapok,
others like a slightly rough cotton cloth or notched wood. Some say it
is like a gentle breeze. For others it appears as a star, a jewel, a
pearl, a necklace, a garland, smoke, a spiderweb, a cloud, a lotus, a
disk, or even like the moon and sun. These differences exist because a
<em>nimitta</em> arises from a person’s perception (<em>saññā</em>), which is
different for each individual.</p>
<p>When a <em>nimitta</em> arises the meditator should first go and inform the
teacher (as a way to verify the experience and to avoid
misunderstanding), and then steadily establish attention on that image.
With the arising of this counterpart sign (<em>paṭibhāga-nimitta</em>) the
hindrances are quelled, mindfulness is strong, and the mind reaches
access concentration. Here the meditator should try and protect this
image (i.e. to protect the state of concentration), by avoiding the
seven unsuitable conditions and engaging in the seven suitable
conditions. (See
Note <a href="#note-seven-supports">Seven Supporting Conditions</a>) He or she should meditate diligently
in order to develop the image, by following the practices leading to
attainment concentration (the ‘ten skills for attainment’ –
<em>appanā-kosalla</em>), for example by making consistent effort, until
eventually attainment concentration is reached and the person achieves
the first jhāna. (See
Note <a href="#note-ten-skills">Ten Skills for Absorption</a>) {821}</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Stages of Attention</span><a id="note-stages-attention"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the commentaries, this interval between taking note
(<em>anubandhanā</em>) and the appearance of a <em>nimitta</em> contains two
additional stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>phusanā</em> (a focus on the point of breath’s contact at the tip of
the nostrils by a meditator who is establishing the mind in
attainment concentration); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>ṭhapanā</em> (a fixed attention on an object until the mind reaches
attainment concentration).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>‘Pure’ <em>ṭhapanā</em> is specifically the subsequent stage of establishing
attention on the <em>nimitta</em>, protecting the <em>nimitta</em>, and sustaining
attention until one reaches attainment concentration. After attaining
jhāna, if one then uses this meditation in order to develop insight,
this is called the stage of <em>sallakkhaṇā</em> (reflection, specifically on
the three characteristics). Eventually one reaches path (<em>magga</em>),
which is referred to as ‘turning away’ (<em>vivaṭṭanā</em>), and fruit
(<em>phala</em>), which is referred to as ‘purity’ (<em>pārisuddhi</em>, i.e.
freedom from defilement). The final stage is ‘review’ (<em>paṭipassanā</em>):
to reflect upon the path and fruit that one has realized (this is the
same as ‘reflection’ – <em>paccavekkhaṇa</em>). Altogether there are eight
stages of attention (beginning with <em>gaṇanā</em> and ending with
<em>paṭipassanā</em>).</p>

<p>From one perspective, the life of a human being can be described as a
struggle for survival, stability, and safety. From another perspective,
however, each person searches for happiness and satisfaction. It is not
only prosperous people who seek happiness; those people who struggle
with all their might for survival do so as well. No matter if one looks
at a long period of time, say of developing a career and engaging in
various activities, or if one looks at brief intervals of time, say of
momentary movements and actions, the search for happiness is always an
inherent part of life. This is true even if one is occasionally faced by
challenging matters of conscience or ethics.</p>
<p>In truth, the search for happiness over a long period of time extends
from the search for happiness in each moment. In one’s own daily life,
one must take an interest in finding a way to experience happiness in
every moment; one’s search for happiness will thus be successful. If one
is unable to experience happiness in every moment, the possibility of
happiness in the long run will remain a vague hope. But if one is able
to experience happiness in each moment one’s wish will immediately
become fulfilled. And when external, surrounding conditions are
favourable, one’s happiness will only increase.</p>
<p>The ordinary human process of seeking happiness, which is evident even
in short-term or momentary periods of time, is such: desire arises (or
is made to arise) and the person then acts in various ways to satisfy
that desire. When there is gratification, the desire abates and the
person experiences happiness. The more the desire is stimulated, the
more intense is the gratification and pleasure. Happiness is thus the
gratification of desire.</p>
<p>We can then ask the question: ‘What is desire?’ This question need not
be answered directly. What is clear is that when desire arises, there
are two significant manifestations: first, is a sense of lack and
deficiency, an absence of a desired object, either a true lack or one
that is created in the mind. Second, is a feeling of agitation or
suffering because one is hindered or one is pulled away from how things
exist in that moment. One is unable to be at peace, and one must
struggle to find a way to still the agitation.</p>
<p>Only when desire is gratified does one feel back to normal and does the
agitation abate or stop. During this period of time one experiences
happiness. But if the desire is not gratified one experiences a sense of
loss, agitation, oppression, and affliction.</p>
<p>Suffering in fact begins with the onset of desire, because desire is
accompanied by agitation. Thus, the ordinary search for happiness is
equivalent to inducing suffering and then looking for a way to
momentarily alleviate it: here, happiness is equivalent to the quenching
of suffering. The more one induces the suffering, the greater the
happiness when this suffering abates.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the time that elapses during the onset of desire,
the subsequent lack and agitation, and the period of unfulfilled
gratification is long, whereas the time of gratification and alleviation
is fleeting. The life of human beings, which is a mixture of pleasure
and pain, is thus full of suffering and nourished by hope. {845} What is
of graver concern is that there are many desires which remain
unfulfilled and for which there is no hope of fulfilment. There is thus
a chronic and deepening suffering. When people grow impatient or when
they feel hopeless, many of them will struggle in every way possible. If
their suffering is not alleviated, they often vent this suffering
outwards, creating greater problems for themselves and others.</p>
<p>The matter does not end here. When people desire and act in order to
fulfil this desire, they encounter obstacles, and in relation to others
who have similar desires they face competition. A life of desire
necessarily includes irritation, anger, resentment, persecution,
oppression, and distress, and is beset by problems stemming from such
anger and oppression. The greater and more frequently one desires, the
greater and more frequent is one’s irritation and affliction. (Please
note here that ‘desire’ here refers to the desire of craving. If one
possesses wholesome desire – <em>chanda</em>, obstacles may even turn out to
be fun.)</p>
<p>Worse than this, when one habitually entrusts one’s happiness to desire
and its gratification, later on, when one sees nothing worthy of desire
or desirable objects lose their appeal, and one is not actively
searching for gratification, one is left feeling bored, apathetic, and
disillusioned. Life becomes insufferable and meaningless. This is
another form of suffering, but one which is insipid and wearisome; it
may even be more discomforting than the suffering of waiting for sensual
gratification. When people take refuge in desire and in pleasurable
objects, entrust their happiness to gratification of desires, and create
elaborate ways to fulfil desire, their suffering thus becomes more
refined and complex. Such is a course of life based on suffering.</p>
<p>There is an alternative way of life which is completely free from these
problems mentioned above. Here, a person truly lives in the present
moment. One is aware of and fully awake to the things presently
experienced. One knows and understands those things which must be
engaged with in the present moment, and one deals with them accordingly.
This is a way of living with mindfulness and clear comprehension
(<em>sati-sampajañña</em>), or with mindfulness and wisdom (<em>sati-paññā</em>), in
line with the teaching on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness described
earlier. Here, mindfulness keeps pace with the present moment; one lives
in the present. A person who follows this way of life is truly alive.
(Many people are not truly alive, because they either live in the past
or in the future.)</p>
<p>When one lives fully in the moment, there is no sense of lack or
deprivation and there is an absence of stress from the constrictions and
strains of desire. One experiences sense impressions in a full and
complete way, and thus there is satisfaction in each moment. One does
not rely on the happiness resulting from temporary gratification of
desire and the alleviation of suffering. No suffering arises which must
be brought to an end; it is a life free from suffering – an inherent
happiness existing at all times. From a life based on suffering, one
lives a life based on an absence of suffering – a life based on
happiness.</p>
<p>When one’s life is based on an absence of suffering, if one wishes to
experience a form of happiness that is within the limits of one’s
ability, one can enjoy this happiness to the fullest. Even if one
occasionally seeks pleasure through the fulfilment of desire, this is
not a problem, despite at that time there being a lack of gratification,
because the latter happiness of non-suffering prevails and acts as a
surety. Moreover, due to the absence of conditions giving rise to
suffering and hindering the mind, such persons are ready to effectively
solve problems externally, either those of an individual or of society,
to the utmost of their ability.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the material in the preceding paragraph is a
definition for ‘cessation (of suffering)’ – <em>nirodha</em>. A correct
definition for this term is ‘to bring about the state in which there is
no suffering that must be extinguished’, that is, ‘to bring about a
freedom from suffering’. This term does not merely refer to eliminating
already arisen suffering. This corresponds to the appendix in chapter 4,
discussing the difficulties of translating this term. The meaning of
<em>nirodha</em> in the early texts is the non-arising of suffering, not a
cessation of already arisen suffering. {846}</p>

especially in relation to concentration (<em>samādhi</em>) and wisdom
(<em>paññā</em>), he stated the following: (1) heedfulness is technically a
factor of concentration; (2) mindfulness lies at the heart of
heedfulness; and (3) heedfulness supports the establishment of
wisdom.</p>

<p>The meaning of <em>sati</em> is not the same as ‘memory’, yet
‘recollection’ or ‘remembrance’, which is an expression of memory,
is one aspect or one definition of <em>sati</em> used frequently in the
scriptures, for example in the term <em>buddhānussati</em> (’recollection
of the Buddha’). The true meaning of <em>sati</em>, however, is as defined
above and is fairly adequately translated into English as
‘mindfulness’.</p>

<p>The commentarial analysis here states that the mind (<em>citta</em>) and
mental concomitants (<em>cetasika</em>) are established on one object. For
commentarial explanations of <em>samādhi</em>, see: Vism. 84-5; NdA. II.
388; PsA. I. 17. It is possible for <em>samādhi</em>, or one-pointedness
(<em>ekaggatā</em>), to arise in an unwholesome mind (<em>akusala-citta</em>). For
example, the teachings at Dhs. 75-87 describe how one-pointedness –
the faculty of <em>samādhi</em> (<em>samādhindriya</em>) – and ‘wrong
concentration’ (<em>micchā-samādhi</em>) exist together in an unwholesome
mind. The commentaries give examples for this, including: a person
whose attention is one-pointed at the moment of cutting an animal’s
throat, of stealing, and of seducing someone else’s wife. In any
case, the one-pointedness of an unwholesome mind is weaker than that
of a wholesome mind. It is like sprinkling water on a dry and dusty
ground; the dust will disappear temporarily but before long it will
return as before (see: DhsA. 144, 248, 251).</p>

leading to liberation, to a freedom from suffering; and
<em>kusala-samādhi</em> – ‘wholesome concentration’. See, e.g.: DhsA. 144.</p>

<p>The relationship between the mind and the body can be divided
into three stages, corresponding to spiritual development: on a
rudimentary level there is both physical and mental suffering;
physical symptoms impinge on the mind – when the body is unwell the
mind also becomes unwell, increasing the sense of ‘dis-ease’. On an
intermediate level physical suffering remains confined to the body;
a person is able to limit the impact physical illness has on the
mind – one recognizes and accepts the level of discomfort, without
allowing the suffering to intensify. On a higher level, the mind at
ease helps to allay physical suffering; when the body is unwell,
apart from not creating mental suffering, a person is able to use
the strength and goodness of the mind to assist in healing the body.</p>

one to shed tears; (2) momentary bliss (<em>khaṇikā-pīti</em>): one
experiences momentary flashes of rapture, like flashes of lightning;
(3) periodic or surging bliss (<em>okkantikā-pīti</em>): one feels pulses
of rapture in the body, like waves washing against the shore; (4)
transportive bliss (<em>ubbeṅgā-pīti</em>): one feels a strong sense of
exhilaration, causing one to behave or act in spontaneous ways, say
by uttering verses, or to feel as if one is floating; (5)
all-pervasive bliss (<em>pharaṇā-pīti</em>): to experience rapture and
exhilaration throughout one’s whole body (Vism. 143-4).</p>

<p>The Paṭisambhidāmagga mentions ten types of spiritual power. The
spiritual power mentioned here by the Buddha comprises the first of
these ten. The tenth type in this list refers to success resulting
from a proper engagement with a particular activity, and the final
example of this tenth type of power is the utter abandonment of
mental defilement through the path of arahantship (Ps. II. 205-214).
The Visuddhimagga explains <em>iddhi</em> especially in terms of psychic
powers (Vism. 385-406), but it also offers some alternative
definitions, for example: the success resulting from a specific
trade or profession, even from ploughing and sowing, is an example
of the tenth type of <em>iddhi</em> mentioned above (Vism. 383-4). We can
thus conclude that the paths to success can be applied in the
context of all human activities. [Trans.: for more on the subject

short period of time as possessing the following five qualities: (1)
faith in the Tathāgata’s wisdom and awakening; (2) good health; few
illnesses; a good metabolism (balanced fire element); (3) he is
candid with the Teacher (the Buddha) and with his companions in the
holy life; he is not deceptive; (4) earnest perseverance; and (5)
wisdom which penetrates the nature of the defilements.</p>

<p>The commentaries explain that although the meditation on the
four unbounded states of mind does not generate a counterpart sign,
as occurs for example in the case of <em>kasiṇa</em> meditation, it has
‘breaking down of barriers’ (<em>sīma-sambheda</em>; the way in which
unconditional lovingkindness, for example, is utterly free of
discrimination and spreads love towards all living creatures) as its
mental image (<em>nimitta</em>), which is developed to the stage of
attainment concentration (see: Vism. 307).</p>

<p>In this context, there are five kinds of proficiency (<em>vasī</em>):
(1) proficiency in reflecting on the state of jhāna one has exited
from (<em>āvajjana-vasī</em>); (2) proficiency in entering a state of jhāna
immediately – anytime, anywhere – at will (<em>samāpajjana-vasī</em>);
(3) proficiency in determination (<em>adhiṭṭhāna-vasī</em>): to be able to
establish the mind and stay in jhāna for as long as one wishes,
preventing the mind of jhāna (<em>jhāna-citta</em>) from falling into a
state of subliminal consciousness (<em>bhavaṅga</em>); (4) proficiency in
exiting jhāna (<em>vuṭṭhāna-vasī</em>): to be able to exit jhāna at a
predetermined time or whenever one wishes; (5) proficiency in
reviewing jhāna (<em>paccavekkhaṇa-vasī</em>): this is the same as
<em>āvajjana-vasī</em>, applied on subsequent occasions. See: Ps. I.
99-100. Cited and explained at: Vism. 154; PsA. I. 316; CompṬ.:
Manodvāravīthi, Javananiyamavaṇṇanā &amp; Kammaṭṭhānaparicchedavaṇṇanā,
Gocarabhedavaṇṇanā. The commentators state that one should gain full
proficiency in regard to a specific level of jhāna before developing
subsequent states of jhāna; otherwise, one may fall away from both
states of jhāna already attained and those yet to be attained. On
this subject of proficiency the commentators refer to A. IV. 418.</p>

Note that according to the commentators, <em>ānāpānasati</em> is not able
to lead to the formless jhānas, for they claim that the formless
jhānas are dependent on <em>kasiṇa</em> meditation (e.g.: Vism. 324-5).</p>

<p>According to the scriptures, when Prince Siddhattha as a young
boy attained the first jhāna while sitting under the Jambolan tree
during the king’s ploughing ceremony, this concentrative attainment
resulted from his focusing on the breath (see: M. I. 246; MA. II.

<p>The Visuddhimagga explains that at the time of dying a person is
able to know the final in- and out-breath, from beginning to end,
along with the passing away (<em>cuti</em>) of the <em>citta</em>. It also says
that only some monks who attain arahantship by developing other
forms of meditation are able to determine the length of their
lifespan, while those who attain arahantship by developing the
complete sequence of <em>ānāpānasati</em> are able to determine their
lifespan (they are able to determine how much longer they will live
and to determine their time of death); see: Vism. 292.</p>

<p>‘Empty hut’ is translated from <em>suññāgāra</em>. The Visuddhimagga
interprets this term as ‘empty place’ (a place void of any
buildings), i.e. the seven kinds of dwellings apart from a forest
and the foot of a tree (see: Vism. 270).</p>

<p>The Vinaya commentaries translate <em>assāsa</em> as ‘exhalation’ and
<em>passāsa</em> as ‘inhalation’. The Sutta commentaries, however,
translate these terms in an opposite way: <em>assāsa</em> as ‘inhalation’
and <em>passāsa</em> as ‘exhalation’ (see: Vism. 271). Here, the preferred
translation in Thailand is presented, in accord with the Vinaya
commentaries. Those who prefer the Sutta commentary interpretation
should make the switch themselves.</p>

<p>The opinion of the commentaries is that beginners of meditation
should only practise the first tetrad – the four factors of the
first group; the subsequent tetrads can be practised when one has
attained jhāna. Furthermore, the first three tetrads can be used for
both tranquillity and insight meditations; the fourth tetrad,
however, can only be used for insight meditation. See: Vism. 275-6,
290.</p>

<p>The passage explaining this method of counting in the
Visuddhimagga is too brief, which has led to divergent
interpretations. The explanations in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and the
West tend to vary. For simplicity sake I have illustrated the way
that is taught in Thailand. (It does not matter whether one begins
with the in- or the out-breath – whichever one is more clear is
acceptable.) In order to show the original system, I have described
the way of practice as found in the Visuddhimagga. Practitioners can
modify this system as they wish, similar to how modern meditation
centres teach the mantra <em>buddho</em> or use other methods besides
counting to keep attention on the breath (the essential factor is to
find a skilful means for keeping the mind focused).</p>

<p>The commentators say that for those people with long noses the
breath is more evident at the tip of the nostrils; for those with
short noses it is more evident at the upper lip. They also say that
if one follows the breath as it enters the body one will experience
a stifled feeling in the chest, while if one follows the breath
outwards one will get distracted by various other sense impressions.</p>

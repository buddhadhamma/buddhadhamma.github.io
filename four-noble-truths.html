<p>The teaching of the Four Noble Truths encompasses the Buddhist teachings
in their entirety. The entire subject matter discussed in <em>Buddhadhamma</em>
is encapsulated in the Four Noble Truths, and therefore this teaching
acts as the summary and conclusion to this book. There are some
important points to understand in reference to the Four Noble Truths:</p>

<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Friends, just as the footprint of any animal that walks can be placed
within an elephant’s footprint, and so the elephant’s footprint is
declared the chief of them because of its great size; so too, all
wholesome states can be included in the Four Noble Truths.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 184-5.</em></p>
<p>So long, monks, as my knowledge and vision of these Four Noble Truths
as they really are in their three phases and twelve aspects was not
thoroughly purified in this way, I did not claim to have awakened to
the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment….</p>
<p><em>Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta: Vin. I. 11; S. V. 422-3.</em></p>
<p>Monks, it is through not understanding, not penetrating the Four Noble
Truths that I as well as you have for a long time run on and wandered
round [the cycle of birthand-death].</p>
<p><em>D. II. 90.</em></p>
<p>Then the Blessed One gave the householder Upāli a gradual instruction,
that is, talk on giving, talk on virtue, talk on the heavens; he
explained the danger, degradation, and defilement in sensual pleasures
and the blessing of renunciation. When he knew that the householder
Upāli’s mind was ready, receptive, free from hindrances, delighted,
and confident, he expounded to him the teaching special to the
Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1-1"><a href="#fn-fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. I. 379-80.</em></p>
<p>A person lives the holy life under the Blessed One in order to know,
to see, to realize, to experience for himself, to attain that which is
not yet known, seen, realized, experienced, and attained, [that is]:
this is suffering, this is the origin of suffering, this is the end of
suffering, this is the path leading to the end of suffering. {847}</p>
<p><em>A. IV. 384-5.</em></p>

<p>One of the unique characteristics of Buddhism is that it only teaches
those truths which can be applied to benefit one’s life. The Four Noble
Truths are of direct benefit to people’s lives. Buddhism does not
concern itself with abstract truths that have no practical value. For
this reason, the Buddha did not concern himself and waste time with
metaphysical debates:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>If anyone should say thus: ’I will not lead the holy life under the
Blessed One until the Blessed One declares to me “the world is eternal
or not eternal, the world is finite or the world is infinite, the life
principle and the body are the same or the life principle is one thing
and the body another, a being exists after death or does not exist, a
being both exists and does not exist after death, or a being neither
exists nor does not exist after death” ’ that would still remain
undeclared by the Tathāgata and meanwhile that person would die.</p>
<p>Suppose, a man were wounded by an arrow thickly smeared with poison,
and his friends and companions, his kinsmen and relatives brought a
skilled surgeon to treat him. The man would say: ’I will not let the
surgeon pull out this arrow until I know whether the man who wounded
me was a noble or a brahmin or a merchant or a labourer; until I know
the name and clan of the man who wounded me, whether he was tall or
short or of middling height; whether he was dark, fair-skinned, or
swarthy; and whether he lives in such a village or town or city. I
will not let the surgeon pull out this arrow until I know whether the
bow that wounded me was a long bow or a crossbow; whether the
bowstring that wounded me was made with fibre or bamboo or sinew or
hemp or bark; whether the shaft that wounded me was wild or
cultivated; until I know with what kind of feathers the shaft that
wounded me was fitted – whether those of a vulture or an adjutant
stork or a hawk or a peacock or a sithilahanu bird; until I know with
what kind of sinew the shaft that wounded me was bound – whether that
of an ox or a buffalo or a langur or a monkey; and until I know what
kind of arrowhead it was that wounded me.’ Before being able to know
all of this that man would surely die. So too, if anyone should say
thus: ’I will not lead the holy life’ … meanwhile that person would
die.</p>
<p>Māluṅkyaputta, if there is the view ’the world is eternal’, the holy
life cannot be lived; and if there is the view ’the world is not
eternal’, the holy life cannot be lived. Whether there is the view
’the world is eternal’ or the view ’the world is not eternal’, there
is still birth, there is still aging, there is still death, there are
still sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair; it is the
destruction of these [forms of suffering] I prescribe here and
now….</p>
<p>Therefore, remember what I have left undeclared as undeclared, and
remember what I have declared as declared. And what have I left
undeclared? ’The world is eternal’, ’the world is not eternal’…. Why
have I left that undeclared? Because it is unbeneficial, it does not
belong to the fundamentals of the holy life, it does not lead to
disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct
knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. That is why I have left it
undeclared.</p>
<p>And what have I declared? I have declared: ’This is suffering’, ’this
is the origin of suffering’, ’this is the cessation of suffering’,
’this is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’ And why have
I declared that? Because it is beneficial, it belongs to the
fundamentals of the holy life, it leads to disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to direct knowledge, to
enlightenment, to Nibbāna. That is why I have declared it. {848}</p>
<p><em>M. I. 428-31.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>On another occasion the Buddha said that the things he has realized are
numerous, but the things he has taught are few. This is because he only
teaches those things that are of benefit and can be used to solve
problems. Specifically, these beneficial things are the Four Noble
Truths:</p>
<p>The Buddha was once staying in the Siṁsapā grove near the city of
Kosambī. At that time he picked up a small handful of Narra tree leaves
and said to the monks:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’What do you estimate, monks, which is more numerous: these few narra
leaves that I hold in my hand or those in the Siṁsapā grove overhead?’</p>
<p>’Venerable sir, the few narra leaves that the Blessed One holds in his
hand are of a small amount, while those in the Siṁsapā grove overhead
are much more numerous.’</p>
<p>’So too, monks, the things I have directly known but have not taught
you are numerous, while the things I have taught you are few. And why,
monks, have I not taught those many things? Because they are
unbeneficial, irrelevant to the fundamentals of the holy life, and do
not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to
direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>’And what, monks, have I taught? I have taught: “This is suffering”; I
have taught: “This is the origin of suffering”; I have taught: “This
is the cessation of suffering”; I have taught: “This is the way
leading to the cessation of suffering.” And why have I taught this?
Because it is beneficial, relevant to the fundamentals of the holy
life, and leads to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to
peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. Therefore I
have taught this.</p>
<p>’Therefore, monks, you should make effort in order to understand
according to the truth: “This is suffering, this is the origin of
suffering, this is the cessation of suffering, this is the way leading
to the cessation of suffering.” ’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn2-1"><a href="#fn-fn2">2</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 437-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Four Noble Truths are a vital teaching for both renunciants and
laypeople. The Buddha therefore urged the monks to give teachings to the
laypeople so that they understand these truths:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, those to whom you ought to give assistance or those who are
receptive to the teachings – whether friends or colleagues, relatives
or kinsmen – these you should encourage and exhort to be settled and
established in a realization of the Four Noble Truths as they really
are.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 434-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>These Four Noble Truths, monks, are actual, unerring, and constant.
Therefore they are called noble truths….</p>
<p><em>S. V. 435.</em></p>
<p>Monks, the Tathāgata is the Noble One in this world with its devas,
Māra, and Brahma, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins,
its devas and humans. Therefore they are called noble truths (because
they are realized and revealed by the Buddha, the Noble One).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn3-1"><a href="#fn-fn3">3</a></sup>
{849}</p>
<p><em>S. V. 435.</em></p>
<p>Monks, it is because he has fully awakened to these Four Noble Truths
as they really are that the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly
Enlightened One, is called the Noble One.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn4-1"><a href="#fn-fn4">4</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 433.</em></p>

</div>
<p>Referring to passages in the Pali Canon, the Visuddhimagga presents four
definitions for the Four Noble Truths (See
Note <a href="#note-noble-truths">Noble Truths</a>):</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Noble Truths</span><a id="note-noble-truths"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vism. 495. For the first definition the Visuddhimagga quotes the
following passage: ’Monks, because the “noble ones” (i.e. the
enlightened ones) penetrate these truths, they are called noble
truths’, but I am unable to find this passage in the Tipiṭaka as it
remains today. As for the fourth definition, the term <em>ariya</em> is
normally translated as ’noble’ or ’excellent’, and thus <em>ariya-sacca</em>
is translated as ’noble truth’, but the commentators here interpret
<em>ariya</em> according to the passage quoted above, as ’actual’ or ’sure’.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Truths realized by the ’noble ones’ (see preceding footnote).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truths belonging to the Noble One (Pali definition B, above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truths leading to the state of being a Noble One (Pali definition C,
above).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truths that are actual and certain (Pali definition A, above).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The canonical explanations for the four truths are as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Now this, monks, is the noble truth of suffering: birth is suffering,
aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering;
encounters with what is displeasing is suffering; separation from what
is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in
brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.</p>
<p>Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is
craving which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and
lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, craving for sensual
pleasures, craving for existence, craving for annihilation.</p>
<p>Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it
is the remainderless elimination and cessation of that same craving,
the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, nonattachment
to it.</p>
<p>Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the way leading to the
cessation of suffering: it is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is,
right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right
livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn5-1"><a href="#fn-fn5">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Further explanations are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkha</em>: suffering; conditions that are difficult to endure; human
predicaments. On a more profound level, this truth refers to the
state of all conditioned things, which are subject to the natural
laws of impermanence, <em>dukkha</em>, and nonself. Conditioned phenomena
are accompanied by pressure, stress, conflict, and obstruction. They
are inherently flawed and imperfect; they lack true substance and
stability; they are unable to provide lasting satisfaction and
contentment; they are constantly prone to cause problems and to
create suffering for someone who attaches to them with clinging
(<em>upādāna</em>). {850}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkha-samudaya</em> (abbreviated as <em>samudaya</em>): the origin or source
of suffering; i.e. craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), which seizes onto a belief in
’self’, establishing an ’I’, which is presumed to experience and
acquire, exist and cease to exist in different circumstances.
Attaching to this sense of self subjects a person to continual
agitation, anxiety, yearning, possessiveness, hatred, fear,
suspicion, boredom, and other forms of mental affliction. One is
thus unable to truly feel at ease, free, and joyous; one does not
know happiness that is immaculate and secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkha-nirodha</em> (abbreviated as <em>nirodha</em>): the cessation of
suffering; the state reached when one completely eliminates
ignorance and craving, when one is not influenced or compelled by
craving, and when one is not oppressed by anxiety, boredom, or any
other form of mental affliction. One is liberated, peaceful, bright
and at ease; one experiences pure happiness. In short, <em>nirodha</em> is
equivalent to Nibbāna.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkhanirodhagāminī-paṭipadā</em> (abbreviated as <em>magga</em>: the Path):
the path leading to the cessation of suffering or the mode of
practice for reaching the end of suffering, i.e. the Noble Eightfold
Path (<em>ariya-aṭṭhaṅgikamagga</em>; the supreme path consisting of eight
factors), i.e. right view … right concentration. This path is
known as the Middle Way (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>) because it proceeds in
a balanced way to the end of suffering, without getting stuck at or
veering towards either of the two extremes: indulgence in sensual
pleasures (<em>kāmasukhallikānuyoga</em>) or self-mortification
(<em>attakilamathānuyoga</em>; practices of self-torment).</p>
</li>

<p>In answer to the question, ’What did the Buddha realize at his
enlightenment?’ it is equally accurate to say that he realized Dependent
Origination and that he realized the Four Noble Truths. There are
passages in the Pali Canon to substantiate both of these claims.</p>
<p>This is because these two teachings are essentially the same and point
to the same truths: Dependent Origination is an essential element of the
Four Noble Truths, and the Four Noble Truths incorporates Dependent
Origination. Let us look at the scriptural evidence for this assertion:</p>
<p>The Vinaya Piṭaka describes the story of the Buddha’s enlightenment,
beginning with the time immediately after his enlightenment, when for an
entire week he experienced the bliss of liberation and contemplated
Dependent Origination, both the forward sequence (the arising of
suffering) and the reverse sequence (the cessation of suffering).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn6-1"><a href="#fn-fn6">6</a></sup>
After seven weeks of experiencing the bliss of liberation, the Buddha
considered proclaiming the Dhamma to others and he had this thought:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’This Dhamma that I have attained is profound, difficult to see,
difficult to realize…. [It is difficult] for such a generation
delighting in attachment to see this truth, namely, specific
conditionality, Dependent Origination. And it is hard to see this
truth, namely … Nibbāna. {851}</p>
<p><em>Vin. I. 1-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Sutta Piṭaka presents a similar description of the Buddha’s life
story, beginning with the thoughts that led him to go forth and leave
the palace, followed by accounts of his going forth as a renunciant,
studying with the ascetics Āḷāra and Uddaka, undertaking and
relinquishing the practices of extreme asceticism, resuming eating food,
and then attaining the jhānas and realizing the three forms of knowledge
at the time of his awakening:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Now when I had eaten solid food and regained my strength, then quite
secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I
entered upon and abided in the first jhāna … the second jhāna …
the third jhāna … the fourth jhāna, which has neither pleasure nor
pain and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity….</p>
<p>When my mind was concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of
defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and imperturbable, I directed
it to knowledge of the recollection of past lives
(pubbenivāsānussati-ñāṇa; the first knowledge – vijjā). I recollected
my manifold past lives…. I directed it to knowledge of the passing
away and reappearance of beings … I saw beings passing away and
reappearing (cutūpapāta-ñāṇa; the second knowledge)…. I directed it
to knowledge of the destruction of the taints (āsavakkhaya-ñāṇa; the
third knowledge). I directly knew as it actually is: ’This is
suffering’, ’this is the origin of suffering’, ’this is the cessation
of suffering’, ’this is the way leading to the cessation of
suffering’; I directly knew as it actually is: ’These are the taints’,
’this is the origin of the taints’, ’this is the cessation of the
taints’, ’this is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.’
When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of
sensual desire, from the taint of becoming, and from the taint of
ignorance.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 163-73, 240-49; M. II. 93, 211-12.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Following these passages is a description of the Buddha’s considerations
on proclaiming the Dhamma, identical to the passage in the Vinaya Piṭaka
quoted above.</p>
<p>The Vinaya Piṭaka describes the period immediately following the
Buddha’s awakening, when the Buddha experienced the bliss of liberation
(which the commentaries say lasted for seven weeks). The description
begins with the Buddha’s review of Dependent Origination and ends with
the Buddha’s thoughts on refraining from teaching the Dhamma due to the
complexity and profundity of Dependent Origination and of Nibbāna. The
Sutta Piṭaka describes the circumstances leading up to the Buddha’s
awakening until he realizes the three forms of knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>). It
passes over the period of experiencing the bliss of liberation and goes
directly to the Buddha’s inclination to refrain from teaching.</p>
<p>Those people who focus on the passages in the Vinaya in which the Buddha
contemplates Dependent Origination, and the passages in both the Vinaya
and the suttas in which the Buddha considers teaching the Dhamma, will
claim that the Buddha realized Dependent Origination. Those people, on
the other hand, who focus on the sutta passages, especially those
describing the realization of the three forms of knowledge, and who
consider primarily the third knowledge, which is the true essence of
awakening (the first two forms of knowledge cannot be considered
equivalent to awakening and are not essential for realizing Nibbāna),
will claim that the Buddha realized the Four Noble Truths, resulting in
liberation from the taints.</p>
<p>Although these two answers are both correct, the two teachings have
different features and a varying scope of application, and thus should
be recognized as distinct from one another.</p>
<p>In regard to the similarity between these two teachings, let us review
the two distinct cycles of Dependent Origination and then compare these
to the Four Noble Truths:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cycle of origination (<em>samudaya-vāra</em>): ignorance arises →
volitional formations arise → … birth arises → aging and death,
sorrow, lamentation … despair arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cycle of cessation (<em>nirodha-vāra</em>): ignorance ceases → volitional
formations cease → … birth ceases → aging and death, sorrow,
lamentation … despair cease. {852}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>A.</em> The origination cycle of Dependent Origination is equivalent to
the first and the second noble truths: suffering (<em>dukkha</em>) and
suffering’s origin (<em>samudaya</em>). In the Four Noble Truths, the final
section of Dependent Origination (birth, aging, death, sorrow,
lamentation, etc.), which is the result of craving and clinging, is
designated as the first noble truth: it refers to the problems that
people encounter and that must be rectified. The teaching then
returns to the preceding factors (ignorance to becoming) and
designate them as the second noble truth: the source of human
problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>B.</em> The cessation cycle of Dependent Origination is equivalent to
the third noble truth (<em>nirodha</em>). It reveals how problems, when
they are properly solved at their root, cease according to the law
of cause and effect. Although the cessation cycle is directly
associated with the third noble truth, it also includes the fourth
noble truth, because the eradication of problems refers indirectly
to the conduct or practice involved in solving these problems; it
points to the particular actions required to resolve problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is thus possible to condense the Four Noble Truths, resulting in two
truths: the existence of suffering (truths 1 and 2) and the end of
suffering (truths 3 and 4).</p>
<p>In some suttas, these two cycles of Dependent Origination are used as
definitions for the second and third noble truths: the origination cycle
is a definition for the second truth, and the cessation cycle is a
definition for the third.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn7-1"><a href="#fn-fn7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>In these definitions, however, only craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) is revealed as the
cause for suffering (<em>samudaya</em>); and similarly, the end of craving is
the definition for cessation (<em>nirodha</em>). This is because craving is the
most obvious defilement; it plays a dominant role and is thus
highlighted for investigation. Despite this abbreviated presentation,
the entire process of Dependent Origination is implied.</p>
<p>The teachings on Dependent Origination and on the Four Noble Truths are
distinct from each other in the following ways:</p>
<p>These two teachings reveal the same truth, but in different ways and
with different objectives. Dependent Origination describes an automatic,
natural process. The Four Noble Truths, on the other hand, presents a
model for wise inquiry and investigation, leading to practical results.</p>
<p>The Four Noble Truths corresponds to the Buddha’s own search for truth,
beginning with his encounters with suffering and his consequent search
for its cause. He discovered that this search is not in vain; there is
indeed a solution. He thus determined the specific points which need to
be attended to and set himself a clear goal. Finally, he carried out the
necessary measures to solve the problem until he reached his desired
goal. The Four Noble Truths is thus used as a systematized teaching for
generating understanding, profiting both the person who presents the
teaching and the person who receives it. {853}</p>
<p>Dependent Origination is the essential dynamic inherent in the Four
Noble Truths which the Buddha contemplated immediately after his
awakening. It is the key teaching which a person must study in order to
understand the gist of the Four Noble Truths.</p>
<p>The main distinction between these teachings is found in relation to the
cessation cycle of Dependent Origination which corresponds to the third
and fourth noble truth. When one compares the cessation cycle with the
third noble truth (<em>nirodha</em>), one sees that it focuses primarily on the
process leading to cessation rather than on the state of cessation –
Nibbāna – itself. For this reason, following the Buddha’s awakening,
while he was considering whether to teach the Dhamma, he distinguished
the two truths that he had realized. His first consideration was:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>This Dhamma that I have attained is profound, difficult to see,
difficult to realize…. [It is difficult] for such a generation
delighting in attachment to see this truth, namely, specific
conditionality, Dependent Origination.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This was followed by a second consideration:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And it is hard to see this truth, namely, the stilling of all
formations, the abandonment of all foundations for suffering, the end
of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The third noble truth, on the other hand, refers principally to the
state of cessation, although the process leading to cessation is
inherent in it.</p>
<p>The cessation cycle of Dependent Origination incorporates the fourth
noble truth (<em>magga</em>), but it does not clearly mark out a path of
practice. It does not clearly specify the details or methods of
practical application: what needs to be done for the process to reach
completion. This is similar to a doctor who knows how to treat an
illness but neither prescribes medicine nor sets down a treatment plan.</p>
<p>In the Four Noble Truths, however, the Buddha specifically distinguished
the fourth truth for the purpose of practical application: it is a way
of practice that has been tested and proved, and leads with certainty to
the goal of complete and utter freedom.</p>
<p>The fourth noble truth (<em>magga</em>) describes spiritual practice in a
detailed, balanced, and comprehensive way; it comprises the entire
Buddhist system of practice. It is called the ’middle way of practice’
or the ’Middle Way’, which is to be undertaken by people in order to
generate results within themselves. Dependent Origination, on the other
hand, is referred to as an ’impartial teaching of truth’ (<em>majjhena
dhammaṁ deseti</em>), or a ’middle teaching’, which accords with the
inherent laws of nature. It encompasses the first three noble truths.
Because the Middle Way (<em>magga</em>) has distinctive features it is
important to distinguish it as a unique teaching. {854}</p>
<p>In sum, the Buddha made a distinction between the truths that he
realized at the time of his awakening: on the one hand there is
Dependent Origination and Nibbāna, and on the other hand the Four Noble
Truths. All of these truths are essentially the same, but viewed from
different perspectives.</p>
<p>The Buddha referred to Dependent Origination and Nibbāna when he was
considering whether to teach the Dhamma, acknowledging how profound
these things are and how difficult it is for beings to understand them.
Nibbāna and Dependent Origination are the essential qualities realized
by the Buddha at the time of his enlightenment; they are the true and
pure essence of the Dhamma, extremely difficult to realize. And they lie
at the heart of the teaching on the Four Noble Truths.</p>
<p>The Buddha referred to the Four Noble Truths when he described his own
practice culminating in his awakening and when he gave teachings to
others, beginning with the First Sermon, on setting the wheel of Dhamma
in motion. The Four Noble Truths comprise the entire range of truths
realized by the Buddha. They are organized into a gradual system of
coherent and effective teachings, which take into account people’s
ability to understand these truths and apply them to their lives.</p>
<p>Nibbāna and Dependent Origination are pure, natural phenomena. The Four
Noble Truths are those matters directly pertaining to human beings; they
are presented in a way that is conducive to understanding and to
practical application. The Four Noble Truths embody the entirety of the
truth (Dhamma), whereas the essential (and the most difficult to
realize) qualities of the truth are Nibbāna and Dependent Origination. A
person who truly understands Nibbāna and Dependent Origination
understands Buddha-Dhamma in its entirety, including the Four Noble
Truths.</p>
<h2 id="actions-to-be-performed-in-relation-to-the-four-noble-truths"><a class="header" href="#actions-to-be-performed-in-relation-to-the-four-noble-truths">Actions to Be Performed in Relation to the Four Noble Truths</a></h2>
<p>It is crucial that one understands and performs the necessary duties in
relation to each of the Four Noble Truths. A correct presentation and
correct practice of the Four Noble Truths relies on an accurate linking
up between each distinct truth and its corresponding responsibility or
action. A failure to do this results in misunderstandings and incorrect
practice. A lack of understanding about the duties connected to each of
the Four Noble Truths also leads to misunderstanding about Buddhism in
general, for example the belief that Buddhism is a pessimistic teaching.</p>
<p>The four duties in respect to the Four Noble Truths are as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn8-1"><a href="#fn-fn8">8</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suffering should be fully understood<br />
(<em>dukkhaṁ ariyasaccaṁ pariññeyyaṁ</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cause of suffering should be abandoned<br />
(<em>dukkhasamudayo ariyasaccaṁ pahātabbaṁ</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cessation of suffering should be realized<br />
(<em>dukkhanirodho ariyasaccaṁ sacchikātabbaṁ</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way leading to the cessation of suffering should be developed<br />
(<em>dukkhanirodhagāminīpaṭipadā ariyasaccaṁ bhāvetabbaṁ</em>). {855}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>A.</em> Thorough knowledge (<em>pariññā</em>): the duty in respect to
suffering is thorough understanding: one should investigate and
understanding suffering as it truly is; one should clearly
understand relevant problems and determine the extent of these
problems. This is a fundamental stage of spiritual practice enabling
one to progress to subsequent stages and to understand the heart of
the human predicament.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>B.</em> Abandonment (<em>pahāna</em>): the duty in respect to the causes for
suffering is to eliminate them – to bring the causes for suffering
to an end; one should remove the source of suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>C.</em> Realization (<em>sacchikiriyā</em>): the duty in respect to the
cessation of suffering is to realize or attain such cessation: to
reach a state in which the essential problems have been solved,
where one is completely free from these problems and has reached the
goal of spiritual practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>D.</em> Cultivation (<em>bhāvanā</em>): the duty in respect to the Path is to
literally ’bring into existence’ – to generate and to increase –
i.e.: to train oneself according to the factors of the Path; to
undertake the practice of the Path, which eliminates the source of
suffering; to follow the methods which lead to the goal; to set down
the details of spiritual practice and to apply these in order to
solve problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is necessary to attend to and accomplish these duties correctly,
matching each duty with its appropriate truth. To perform these duties
correctly requires knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>); the knowledge of these duties in
Pali is referred to as <em>kicca-ñāṇa</em>. Applying this knowledge to link
each noble truth with its matching duty corresponds to different stages
of spiritual practice, and it can be used for solving every kind of
human problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of the duty in relation to <em>dukkha</em>: to know that
suffering needs to be thoroughly understood; to understand the
nature of suffering, the basis of suffering, and the locus of
suffering. This understanding accords with reality, which differs
from understanding things according to how we want them to be or
according to aversion, for instance. As a particular stage of
practice, this refers to the stage of describing or assessing
problems, which must be defined and understood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of the duty in relation to <em>samudaya</em>: to know that the
cause of suffering needs to be abandoned; to understand the causes
of suffering, which should be eliminated. This is the stage of
inquiry and analysis, of diagnosing the source of suffering, which
must be completely eradicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of the duty in relation to <em>nirodha</em>: to know that the
cessation of suffering needs to be realized; to understand the
cessation of suffering, which should be realized. This is the stage
of focusing on the end of suffering – the goal of spiritual
practice – by recognizing that solving the human predicament is
possible, worthy, and something that should be accomplished.
Moreover, one knows how to reach this goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of the duty in relation to <em>magga</em>: to know that the Path
needs to be cultivated; to understand the Path or the way of
practice leading to the end of suffering, which should be developed
and brought to completion. This is the stage of setting down or
acknowledging the methods, stages, and details of practice used for
eliminating the source of suffering which need to be applied and
undertaken.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In sum, we know what our problems are – we know the nature of our
suffering, we know the source of that suffering, we know what to aspire
to (or what achievement is truly desirable), and we know what must be
done – we know how to proceed.</p>
<p>The knowledge of duties (<em>kicca-ñāṇa</em>) is one of three kinds of
knowledge connected to the Four Noble Truths, which are used as criteria
for determining enlightenment: when a person truly knows the Four Noble
Truths with these three kinds of knowledge (comprising twelve factors),
he or she is said to be awakened. {856}</p>
<p>These three kinds of knowledge are referred to collectively as
’knowledge and vision’ (<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>). This knowledge and vision consists of three cycles or rounds (<em>parivaṭṭa</em>), constituting the
three kinds of knowledge:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn9-1"><a href="#fn-fn9">9</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of the truths (<em>sacca-ñāṇa</em>): knowledge of the Four Noble
Truths as they really are: ’this is suffering’, ’this is the source
of suffering’, ’this is the end of suffering’, ’this is the way
leading to the end of suffering’; ’suffering is like this’, ’the
source of suffering is like this’, ’the end of suffering is like
this’, ’the way leading to the end of suffering is like this’. This
knowledge completes the first round (<em>parivaṭṭa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of duties (<em>kicca-ñāṇa</em>): knowledge of the required duties
apropos of each of the Four Noble Truths: <em>dukkha</em> should be fully
understood, the cause of suffering should be abandoned, etc., as
described above. This knowledge completes the second ’round’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge of what has been done (<em>kata-ñāṇa</em>): knowledge of having
accomplished the duties in respect to the Four Noble Truths. One
knows: ’Suffering, which should be fully understood, has been fully
understood’; ’The cause, which should be abandoned, has been
abandoned’; ’Cessation, which should be realized, has been
realized’; ’The Path, which should be developed, has been
developed.’ This knowledge completes the third ’round’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three rounds occur in relation to each of the four truths,
resulting in twelve factors (<em>ākāra</em>) of knowledge and vision. Knowledge
and vision (<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>) thus has three cycles (<em>parivaṭṭa</em>),
containing twelve factors.</p>
<p>The Buddha possessed knowledge and vision of the Four Noble Truths in
their three rounds – he realized the twelve factors – and therefore he
declared that he had achieved the unsurpassed supreme enlightenment.</p>
<p>Knowledge and vision containing these twelve factors is used as a
criterion for verifying all forms of spiritual accomplishment. This
knowledge with its rounds and factors can outlined as seen below, and on
Table <a href="#tbl-three-kinds-of-knowledge">Three Kinds of Knowledge</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suffering is like this – it should be fully understood – it has
been fully understood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cause is like this – it should be abandoned – it has been
abandoned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cessation is like this – it should be realized – it has been
realized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Path is like this – it should be developed – it has been
developed. {857}</p>
</li>

<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/three-kinds-of-knowledge.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>Note also the following points: {858}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkha</em> is paired with the duty of clear understanding (<em>pariññā</em>)
in the sense that suffering should be clearly understood. Therefore,
suffering and all things that are classified as problems are
collectively referred to as ’things which should be clearly
understood’ (<em>pariññeyya-dhamma</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samudaya</em> is paired with the duty of relinquishment (<em>pahāna</em>) in
the sense that the causes for suffering should be abandoned or
eliminated. Therefore, craving and all things classified as causes
for suffering, e.g.: ignorance, greed, hatred, and grasping, are
collectively referred to as things to be relinquished
(<em>pahātabba-dhamma</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nirodha</em> is paired with the duty of realization (<em>sacchikiriyā</em>) in
the sense that the cessation of suffering should be realized.
Therefore, Nibbāna and things related to the goal are called ’things
to be realized’ (<em>sacchikātabba-dhamma</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Magga</em> is paired with the duty of cultivation (<em>bhāvanā</em>) in the
sense that the Path should be developed. The Eightfold Path and all
practices and methods for reaching the goal are called ’things to be
cultivated’ (<em>bhāvetabba-dhamma</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything that exists, without exception, can be classified as and
incorporated into one of these four groups.</p>
<p>On the Path leading to the end of suffering – from rudimentary stages
to the refined, and from relating to external things to realizing
profound phenomena in the mind – it is always possible to associate the
things which one experiences with one of these four groups. For example,
at the highest level of practice, of contemplating the essence of truth,
the Buddha described these four qualities as follows:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn10-1"><a href="#fn-fn10">10</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkha</em>: things to be understood (<em>pariññeyya-dhamma</em>) = the five
aggregates of clinging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samudaya</em>: things to be abandoned (<em>pahātabba-dhamma</em>) = ignorance
(<em>avijjā</em>) and craving for existence (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nirodha</em>: things to be realized (<em>sacchikātabba-dhamma</em>) = true
knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>) and liberation (<em>vimutti</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Magga</em>: things to be developed (<em>bhāvetabba-dhamma</em>) = tranquility
(<em>samatha</em>) and insight (<em>vipassanā</em>).</p>
</li>

<p>The Visuddhimagga, the Sammohavinodanī, and the Saddhammapakāsinī offer
brief and cogent explanations for why the Buddha arranged the Four Noble
Truths in the order that he did:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn12-1"><a href="#fn-fn12">12</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="dukkha"><a class="header" href="#dukkha">Dukkha</a></h3>
<p><em>The Focus Commences on Suffering in order to Apply Wisdom</em></p>
<p>Suffering is oppressive and affects all human beings. Whenever suffering
arises, it is arresting and kindles concern. Even if one looks beyond
one’s own personal experience, one sees the various afflictions and
difficulties that continually beset human beings as the normal state of
affairs. Suffering is apparent to all people – it manifests clearly. It
impels interest and is thus suitable as a regular subject for
contemplation, in particular as the starting point for teaching the
Dhamma.</p>
<p>Moreover, suffering is considered displeasing and frightening for most
people; although it is unavoidable, they do not want to think about it.
If one makes people aware of how they are currently experiencing
suffering or generating problems, they may be shaken from their state of
complacency. The Buddha taught people about suffering in order for them
to begin to contemplate and solve their problems.</p>
<p>By teaching the Four Noble Truths beginning with suffering, one
commences with the problems at hand, with things that are clearly
evident, with things that are arresting, and most importantly, with
things that have a direct relevance to people. One does not begin with
abstract ideas, fanciful notions, or mere rhetoric. When teaching an
individual, one speaks on a subject pertinent to him or her; and when
teaching objectively, one speaks on a subject relevant to all people.</p>
<p>The Buddha taught about suffering not to promote suffering, but to act
as the starting point for ending suffering. He knew that suffering can
be brought to cessation – it is not a compulsory and permanent
condition. Life is frustrating when it is still disturbed by suffering.
If one is able to bring an end to suffering, or if one becomes skilled
at solving problems, then life becomes peaceful and truly happy.</p>
<p>Solving problems is not achieved by avoiding or turning a blind eye to
suffering. Just the opposite: it is achieved by acknowledging and facing
suffering. This does not mean simply enduring suffering or generating
more suffering, but rather it means to gain insight into suffering in
order to be able to be free of it. Instead of accumulating suffering,
one attends to it with wisdom.</p>
<p>Gaining insight is equivalent to performing the correct duty vis-à-vis
suffering, that is, comprehensive understanding (<em>pariññā</em>). One
understands the nature of suffering, where it arises, and the extent of
the problems. Often people avoid suffering and run away from problems;
even though they know that problems exist, they only have a vague or
confused understanding about them. By understanding suffering, one’s
responsibility in this area is accomplished. This is similar to a doctor
who diagnoses the symptoms of an illness and understands its nature,
thus fulfilling one stage in the process of curing it. {860}</p>
<p>It is not our responsibility to eliminate or abandon suffering, because
cessation is not found at suffering itself – one must dispel it at its
causes. Trying to abandon suffering itself is like treating an illness
only at its symptoms, say by taking medicine in order to alleviate the
pain. The illness has not been cured and one must continue to search for
its causes.</p>
<p>Just as a doctor studying the nature of illness must also study about
the human body, which is the home of illness, so too, a practitioner,
who studies the nature of suffering in order to bring about its end,
must study all aspects of human life which constitute the basis of
suffering, along with the nature of conditioned phenomena which play a
participatory role.</p>
<p>The gist of the first Noble Truth is to recognize suffering as it truly
is and to discern the true nature of human life and the world around us.</p>
<h3 id="samudaya-the-source-of-suffering"><a class="header" href="#samudaya-the-source-of-suffering">Samudaya: the Source of Suffering</a></h3>
<p><em>Searching for the True Causes of Suffering Rather than Attributing
Blame</em></p>
<p>If one wishes for the cessation of suffering, one must eliminate its
causes. When one recognizes the nature of one’s suffering – how and
where it manifests – it is time to investigate further for its causes,
in order to accomplish the duty of abandonment or elimination
(<em>pahāna</em>).</p>
<p>In many cases, however, when searching for the source of suffering,
people flee from the truth. They tend to look outside of themselves or
focus on events removed from what is happening in the present moment.
They therefore look for an external agent on whom to lay blame or try to
distance themselves from the problem so as to feel that they are not
responsible.</p>
<p>Laying blame on external factors leads to three false doctrines:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn13-1"><a href="#fn-fn13">13</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Doctrine of past karma (<em>pubbekata-vāda</em>): the belief that all
present happiness and suffering results from past actions; the claim
that all happiness and suffering is connected to past actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doctrine of a supreme God (<em>issaranimmāna-vāda</em>): the belief that
all present happiness and suffering is created by a supreme God;
whether one is escaping ill-fortune or seeking good fortune, one
thus relies on the providence of divine beings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doctrine of fate (<em>ahetu-vāda</em>): the belief that all present
happiness and suffering is random and pointless, without cause and
condition. One believes that neither positive nor negative events
can be altered; when their destined time arrives, they will occur
automatically.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Buddha-Dhamma rejects these doctrines because they oppose the natural
law of causality. The Buddhist teachings encourage people to search for
the causes of suffering in conformity with this law of nature, beginning
with those causes existing within an individual, i.e. volitional actions
(<em>kamma</em>) of thoughts, words, and deeds, both good and bad: those
already performed, those presently being performed, and those stored up
as character traits. And they have people examine their behaviour in
relation to things around them, to check if their actions are proper or
improper in regard to various environmental factors.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, the Buddha described craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) as the source
of human suffering. Craving causes one to act, express oneself, and
relate to the world incorrectly. One does not act with a knowledge of
the truth, but rather one acts influenced by pleasure and aversion, by
likes and dislikes, or by shielding oneself with such defilements as
fear, conceit, envy, and distrust, which are a consequence of craving.
{861}</p>
<p>There are three forms of craving: craving for sensual pleasures
(<em>kāma-taṇhā</em>) – the wish to obtain, to acquire, to consume; craving
for existence (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>) – the wish to become, to endure, to have
eternal life; and the craving for annihilation (<em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>) – the
wish to cease existing, the wish for extinction. And on an even deeper
level the Buddha described the process of Dependent Origination, in
which ignorance acts as the root of craving, the source from which all
suffering flows.</p>
<p>When one eliminates ignorance and craving – the causes for suffering –
and one is not subject to the obstructive power of defilements, one is
able to relate to the world – to other people, to other creatures, and
to nature – with wisdom. One has an understanding of the conditionality
of all things which enables one to solve problems in the optimal way
available to human intelligence.</p>
<p>Although some minor suffering remains, it is merely the <em>dukkha</em>
inherent in nature and is incapable of overpowering one’s mind. When one
is free from the internal subjugation of craving, the only remaining
responsibility is to reflect on the circumstances with which one is
engaged, and to respond with wisdom for the happiness and wellbeing of
others.</p>
<p>On the contrary, as long as people are still oppressed by corrupting and
distorting defilements, they have no chance to truly solve problems or
to dispel suffering, both within themselves and outward in society. In
most cases, when people try to solve problems, they tend to make matters
worse, either by increasing the problem at hand or by creating new ones.
When they experience suffering, rather than bringing it to an end or
reducing it by way of wisdom, they are coerced by craving to compensate
for this situation by increasing the original suffering or by venting
the suffering outwards and harming other people and society.</p>
<p>Human suffering arises and exists in this way, subject to the dictates
of craving and with the support of ignorance, without end.</p>
<h3 id="nirodha-the-cessation-of-suffering"><a class="header" href="#nirodha-the-cessation-of-suffering">Nirodha: the Cessation of Suffering</a></h3>
<p><em>Wisdom Leads to Unrestricted Happiness and Compassion</em></p>
<p>Once the Buddha had described suffering and its causes, which are
matters of adversity and dissatisfaction, he assuaged the minds of those
disciples receptive to his teachings and gave them hope, by teaching the
third noble truth of cessation, revealing that the oppression by
suffering can cease – the basic problems of life can be solved. A
desirable way out exists, because the cause of suffering can be
eliminated and brought to an end.</p>
<p>Suffering exists dependent on causes; when these causes are removed, the
result of suffering likewise ceases. When suffering ceases, the state of
’no suffering’ – a freedom from suffering – arises automatically.
Mental disturbance is transformed into a state of freedom, clarity,
purity, and ease. For this reason cessation is presented as the third
noble truth, both because of the natural sequence of events, and because
of its aptness as a teaching method, which kindles interest, promotes
understanding, and encourages practice leading to true realization.</p>
<p>When one eliminates craving along with its companion defilements, which
tyrannize and seduce the mind, one is no longer harassed by agitation,
yearning, anxiety, fear, animosity, loneliness and boredom. One does not
need to rely on the temporary happiness of fleeing from these disturbing
mind states, of trying to bury them or replace them with something else,
or of venting one’s frustration outwards. {862}</p>
<p>By attending to suffering at its causes, the mind is now liberated,
independent, peaceful, and possessed of a pure happiness; it is not
assaulted by lingering doubts and fears. The normal, constant state of
the mind is one of joy, clarity and ease. One has reached spiritual
perfection and fulfilled the act of realization (<em>sacchikiriyā</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, when the mind is liberated from mental defilements and
entanglements, when it is free and bright, ignorance no longer has any
manipulative power. As a consequence, wisdom is also purified and freed
from the deceptive and corrupting influence of the defilements. One is
able to reflect on things correctly and in harmony with the truth, and
discern things according to cause and effect.</p>
<p>When ignorance and craving are not present to cause misunderstanding,
wisdom is the principal agent to guide behaviour. One then acts,
expresses oneself, and relates to the world with a thorough knowledge of
the ways of nature. Apart from being the bedrock of internal purity and
freedom, outwardly, wisdom helps for applying one’s personal knowledge
and capabilities to solve other people’s problems and to generate true
wellbeing. A person’s intelligence is used to its fullest extent without
impediment or distortion, and it is used only for wholesome purposes.
This is to live one’s life guided by wisdom.</p>
<p>Moreover, when a person is free, steady, and naturally happy – not
self-obsessed, not looking for things to consume, not trying to protect
or reinforce the burden of self-importance – the mind becomes expansive
and the feeling of freedom pervades outwards. One becomes receptive to
the happiness and suffering of fellow creatures and one wishes to
provide assistance. Wisdom is then provided with the power of compassion
which helps to guide one’s behaviour; one then lives fully for the
wellbeing and happiness of others. When one is free from grasping and
selfish attachment, one is able to perform virtuous and kindly deeds in
a one-pointed, resolute, and devoted way.</p>
<p>Inwardly, one is free, happy, and pure; personal wellbeing has been
brought to perfection (<em>attahita-sampatti</em>). Outwardly, one acts to
support other people (<em>parahita-paṭipatti</em>). Together they complete the
attributes of one who has realized cessation.</p>
<p>A person who walks the noble path does not need to wait to experience
the blessings and benefits of realizing Nibbāna – the heart of
cessation. Even while walking correctly along the Path one is able to
constantly witness the increasing fruits of practice, both in regard to
personal benefits and in regard to those blessings one can bestow on
others.</p>
<p>In ascending order, cessation (<em>nirodha</em>) is outlined by five
stages:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn14-1"><a href="#fn-fn14">14</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Vikkhambhana-nirodha</em>: cessation of suffering and defilement
through suppression: to use concentration in order to make the mind
tranquil, relaxed, free from dullness and anxiety. In particular,
this means applying concentration on the level of jhāna. During the
entire period that one dwells in jhāna the defilements are stilled
and one experiences happiness independent of sensual desires
(<em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tadaṅga-nirodha</em>: cessation of suffering and defilement by way of
opposing or opposite qualities. Most importantly, this refers to an
ability to reflect wisely, to understand the truth of phenomena –
that they exist according to the law of causality and must be
attended to by bearing in mind their causes and conditions. They are
not subject to people’s desires and attachments. With such wisdom a
person acts correctly and relates to things with understanding,
goodwill, and an inner freedom. {863} Wisdom that clearly discerns
things according to the truth is called ’insight wisdom’
(<em>vipassanā-paññā</em>). Mental impurity and suffering is extinguished
as long as this wisdom functions: the mind is calm, pure, bright,
and joyous. It leads to mental refinement and generates deeper
levels of wisdom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samuccheda-nirodha</em>: cessation of suffering and defilement through
severance. One realizes transcendent stages of the Path, beginning
with the path of stream-entry. Defilements and suffering cease
completely and irrevocably, according to the specific stage of the
Path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paṭipassaddhi-nirodha</em>: cessation of suffering and defilement
through stilling. One realizes transcendent ’fruit’ (<em>phala</em>); one
is a noble being, from stream-enterer upwards. Defilements cease and
the mind is pure and free according to the specific stage of being a
noble person (<em>ariya-puggala</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nissaraṇa-nirodha</em>: cessation of defilements through
relinquishment; the state of true and perfect deliverance: Nibbāna.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="magga-the-path-leading-to-the-cessation-of-suffering"><a class="header" href="#magga-the-path-leading-to-the-cessation-of-suffering">Magga: the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering</a></h3>
<p><em>Arrival at the Triple Gem Dispels a Dependence on Fate and Supernatural
Powers</em></p>
<p>When one knows suffering and its origin, and one recognizes the goal
which is the cessation of the suffering, it is then time to engage in
practice.</p>
<p>When one sees clearly the goal to be reached – its attributes and its
attainability – one practises to realize that goal accordingly. If one
does not know what the goal is and in which direction to go, one will
not know how to proceed. For this reason, in terms of the relationship
between the four truths, it is appropriate for the Path to be put at the
end.</p>
<p>Also, in regard to teaching, spiritual practice generally requires a lot
of strength and energy; if practitioners do not recognize the value of
the goal, they will lack will-power. And if they are convinced the
practice is arduous, they may have a loss of heart or even refuse to
proceed. Even if they engage with the practice they will do so as if
coerced, against their will, or listlessly, and their progress will
probably be fruitless.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if one sees the value of the goal one will be happy to
put forth effort. The greater is the goal and the desire to reach it,
the stronger is the motivation for practice. When a person sincerely
desires the goal, he or she will fight to achieve it no matter how
difficult the practice is to reach it.</p>
<p>This is another reason why the Buddha mentioned cessation before the
Path: so that the listener sees the value of and develops a wish for
cessation, generating an enthusiasm to learn the methods of practice and
to apply them. When the Buddha revealed how cessation is truly a worthy
goal, the listeners were determined to hear of the Path and committed to
applying it to practice. They resolved to follow the Path and welcomed
the hardships required to do so.</p>
<p>When people search for the cause of suffering, they tend to attribute
blame outwardly or look for things that are as far from their own sphere
of responsibility as possible. Similarly, when people look for a remedy
for suffering, they tend to look for things externally, to find some
protection in order to release them from responsibility or to remove
suffering on their behalf.</p>
<p>In both cases people are hiding from the truth, not daring to look at
suffering, and avoiding responsibility. This is similar to a person who
flees from danger and looks for a place to bury his head in the sand and
hide his face; he thinks he has escaped the danger even though he is
still surrounded by it. {864}</p>
<p>This behaviour gives rise to a dependence on external things, say by
beseeching what is considered holy, making propitiatory offerings,
waiting for divine acts of power, or simply leaving things up to fate.
Buddhism teaches that depending on such things, or such a resignation to
fate, is not the way to security and safety, and it does not lead to a
true deliverance from suffering.</p>
<p>The correct way of dealing with suffering is to have firm confidence in
the merits of the Triple Gem, to make the mind peaceful and strong, and
to apply wisdom by looking at problems objectively: to see them as they
truly are and to solve them at their root causes.</p>
<p>In other words, with confidence in the Triple Gem, one knows how to
solve problems according to the Four Noble Truths: to know suffering
accurately, to investigate and discover its causes, to recognize the end
of suffering which should be realized, and to develop the appropriate
methods of dealing with suffering directly at its source which lead to
the realization of the goal. In sum, one develops the Eightfold Path.
Practising in this way leads to the true end of suffering, as confirmed
by the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>People in large numbers threatened by danger seek refuge in mountains,
forests and sacred groves and trees. But no such refuge is safe, no
such refuge is supreme. Not by resorting to such a refuge is one freed
from all misery.</p>
<p>One who goes for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha; who
sees clearly with wisdom the Four Noble Truths: suffering, the origin
of suffering, the transcendence of suffering, and the Noble Eightfold
Path leading to the end of suffering. This, indeed, is a safe refuge;
this, indeed, is the refuge supreme. By reaching such a refuge, one is
freed from all misery.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn15-1"><a href="#fn-fn15">15</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Dh. verses 188-92.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A recollection of the Buddha provides us with the confidence that every
person is endowed with an intelligence and capability which can be
trained or developed to perfection. We are all able to realize the
truth, to arrive at the utter freedom from suffering, to transcend
mundane phenomena, and to possess supreme virtues which even the devas
and Brahma gods revere. In this respect, the Great Teacher, the Buddha,
acted as guide and forerunner.</p>
<p>If those people who depend on the supernatural know how to train
themselves well, they will see that there is nothing which the gods or
sacred forces are able to do which equals the virtuous deeds stemming
from a well-cultivated human mind.</p>
<p>A recollection of the Dhamma provides us with the confidence that the
truth is a naturally existing phenomenon and that all things exist
according to causes and conditions. If one is able to discern things as
they truly are, to apply this understanding in a beneficial way, to
relate to things with insight, and to deal with them at their source,
then one can solve problems in the best possible way. One will realize
the truth and live an excellent life.</p>
<p>A recollection of the Sangha provides us with the confidence that a
virtuous community is founded on truth and consists of members who
are free from suffering. Although they have arrived at varying degrees
of spiritual accomplishment, they are united and equal in the face of
Dhamma. Every person participates in building this community by
understanding and practising in accord with the Dhamma. {865}</p>
<p>If one lacks confidence in the Triple Gem then one must depend on
external things, like petitioning sacred forces and praying to divine
beings. But if one has confidence in the Triple Gem then one studies the
way of bringing suffering to an end through insight into causes and
conditions outlined in the Four Noble Truths and one practises spiritual
cultivation in accord with the Buddhist path.</p>
<h3 id="path-of-the-noble-ones-self-mastery-and-mutual-assistance"><a class="header" href="#path-of-the-noble-ones-self-mastery-and-mutual-assistance">Path of the Noble Ones: Self-Mastery and Mutual Assistance</a></h3>
<p>For people with strong faith, who have complete confidence in the Triple
Gem, neither external opinions nor the general vicissitudes of life,
colloquially referred to as twists of fate, can make them waver.</p>
<p>Their state of mind is similar to a person in good health and with a
strong body: they are self-reliant at all times. (See
Note <a href="#note-self-reliance">Self Reliance</a>) They need not depend on external
forces. They look to results from kamma: from deliberate effort in line
with causes and conditions. They have developed wisdom, clearly
understanding the principle of solving problems according to the Four
Noble Truths, and they steadfastly follow the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Self Reliance</span><a id="note-self-reliance"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Admittedly, according to the Buddhist way of practice, until a person
is a stream-enterer (<em>sotāpanna</em>), it is extremely difficult for him
or her to be mentally self-reliant at all times. Therefore, the Buddha
encouraged people who still depend on sacred and divine forces, and on
fate or fortune, to change course and steer towards the truth, by
using new methods for solving problems.</p>
<p>Instead of performing ceremonies to avert catastrophe or remove bad
luck, or of praying to some external power, the Buddha had people find
release in a new way, through acts of wholesome self-surrender and
self-sacrifice, for example by acts of public charity and by
dedicating one’s time and effort to promote the public good.</p>
<p>Even fortune tellers who have faith in Buddhism advise people to
improve their fortunes by offering gifts, making merit, keeping moral
precepts, and observing the <em>uposatha</em> day precepts. Sometimes they
recognize that the devas – especially those in Thailand – who are
being petitioned and prayed to, have been devoted to Buddhism (most of
them are Buddhists ever since they lived as human beings). These devas
are delighted to see people do wholesome and beneficial actions,
instead of worthless, foolish ones.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Such people are said to have entered the stream of bringing suffering to
an end; they have been trained and go in the direction of true
liberation. They become members of the community of the noble ones,
having reached the first stage of noble beings. Such persons are called
stream-enterers (<em>sotāpanna</em>).</p>
<p>On the contrary, the minds of those people who are still captivated –
who spin around in the deluge of worldly currents, who are shaken by the
winds of fortune, whose faith is still unsteady, and whose
self-confidence is not grounded in the merits of the Triple Gem –
resemble a person who is physically sick and ailing: they are not able
to help themselves and must constantly rely on others.</p>
<p>They feel strong when life is calm, but once a tempest sets in they
cannot support themselves. They then choose between enduring the mental
anguish or else seek out some form of intense pleasure like indulging in
an intoxicating substance. Alternatively, they rely on sacred objects,
seek help from divine powers, or expect results from auspicious
ceremonies or from fate, in order to escape their suffering or to derive
some comfort and reassurance. They do not know the correct escape from
suffering and they do not possess the wisdom which perceives things as
they really are; they are unable to transcend the worldly currents.</p>
<p>When they conduct their lives, they fall into one extreme or another: if
they don’t veer towards the extreme of sensual indulgence and
infatuation, they naively follow an oppressively austere way of life;
they do not walk straight on the Middle Way.</p>
<p>In Pali the name for such a person is <em>puthujjana</em>: an unawakened
person. And if someone is devoid of wholesome qualities, is truly blind,
is unable to distinguish between good and evil, lives simply by
responding to craving, does not reflect on his actions, and is prepared
to exploit others for selfish gain, he is referred to as a ’blind and
foolish worldling’ (<em>andhabāla-puthujjana</em>). {866}</p>
<p>If, however, a person recognizes wholesome qualities, hears the subtle
call of the noble ones, begins to live a virtuous life, maintains moral
standards consisting of the ten wholesome courses of action
(<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>), or at least keeps the essential five precepts, he
or she is referred to as a ’virtuous, unawakened person’
(<em>kalyāṇa-puthujjana</em>) or ’one who has heard the teachings of the noble
ones’ (<em>sutavanta-ariyasāvaka</em>). This person is ready to commence the
noble path.</p>
<p>The practice for eliminating the causes of suffering is called the Path,
because it resembles a road leading to the goal, and although this Path
is a single track, it consists of eight factors. In order to reach the
goal these eight factors must be mutually supportive and balanced; they
must act in unison.</p>
<p>To practise correctly and walk unerringly towards the goal relies on
wisdom, which discerns things accurately and acts both to reveal and to
guide. For this reason the first factor of the Path is right view
(<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
<p>Because the Path is balanced and leads straight to the goal, it is
referred to as the Middle Way (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>). It does not deviate
towards the two extremes: those persons walking this Path are neither
obsessed with seeking things for personal gratification – infatuated
with sensuality – nor do they err in the opposite direction, by
undertaking severe austerities and deliberately increasing suffering,
due to disillusionment or self-hatred.</p>
<p>For practice in line with the Path to commence and develop effectively,
it relies on two causes or supports, which are referred to as the
conditions for right view.</p>
<p>First, is the external or social factor of having good instruction by
others (<em>paratoghosa</em>): wholesome opinions, encouragement, and influence
by others. In particular this refers to ’virtuous friends’
(<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>) – for instance parents, teachers, monks, and
honourable people who have achieved success through honest means – who
have attributes worthy of emulation and respect, both those who live
nearby and those who live far away. These individuals are able to teach,
offer advice, and inspire people to develop an enthusiasm for goodness.
By using faith and devotion as a medium they foster correct
understanding in people. Moreover, they urge and guide people to reflect
on things according to the truth independently of others.</p>
<p>The second is the internal factor of wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>): to be able to think and reflect skilfully,
effectively, and methodically; to analyze things in conformity with how
they actually exist and in line with their causes and conditions.</p>
<p>When these two factors exist to summon and support right view, one can
expect with confidence that one’s spiritual practice will proceed
correctly. Other Path factors will develop along with wisdom for one’s
own wellbeing and that of others, and one will advance towards the goal
of Buddha-Dhamma.</p>
<p>Firm confidence in the Triple Gem, a knowledge of the Four Noble Truths,
and practice in accord with the Middle Way – the Eightfold Path –
prevents, or at least mitigates, all kinds of incorrect responses to
suffering or inappropriate means to solve problems.</p>
<p>These incorrect responses take many forms: one may be deluded and
muddled, resigning oneself to suffering and succumbing to despair and
grief; one may use a strategy of evasion and self-deception, trying to
forget suffering by immersing oneself ever deeper in sensual pleasures;
one may depend on supernatural forces, pray for divine intervention, or
resign oneself to fate; one may engage in immoral behaviour; one may
vent frustration outwards by violating and disturbing others; or one may
oppress or chastise oneself due to self-loathing and disillusionment.
{867}</p>
<p>By walking the Path, supported by correct faith and established in
probity, one acts favourably, in a way that is beneficial to oneself and
others. One responds to circumstances with fortitude and inner peace.
One solves problems with clear awareness, intelligence, and effort,
dealing with them in line with causes and conditions.</p>
<p>And even in one’s most unsteady moments, when one is not able to help
oneself, one knows how to find virtuous friends, who can encourage one’s
wholesome qualities, and who can give advice to foster an understanding
of causality so that one can address problems correctly.</p>
<p>Although the responsibility vis-à-vis the Path is <em>bhāvanā</em> –
cultivation, development, training, bringing into being, undertaking –
defining the Path (<em>magga</em>) as ’practice’ or ’Dhamma practice’ can lead
to an overly narrow understanding, or even to a misunderstanding of this
term.</p>
<p>In fact, the term <em>magga</em> encompasses the entire practical dimension of
Buddhism; it is equivalent to the term <em>cariya-dhamma</em> (’practical
application’) or it comprises the entire system of virtuous conduct.
Another synonym for <em>magga</em> is the term <em>brahmacariya</em>, which is
translated as the ’holy life’ or ’sublime life’.</p>
<p>The eight factors of the Path can be separated, elaborated on, and given
a new shape depending on one’s point of emphasis and consonant with the
level of spiritual practice being addressed. Examples of this are the
ten wholesome ways of conduct (<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>), which are suitable
for laypeople and emphasize external actions more than internal matters,
and the seven stages of purity (<em>visuddhi</em>), which focus on the highest
goal of Buddhism and emphasize insight wisdom (<em>vipassanā-paññā</em>).</p>
<h3 id="confidence-in-the-triple-gem-leads-to-the-threefold-training"><a class="header" href="#confidence-in-the-triple-gem-leads-to-the-threefold-training">Confidence in the Triple Gem Leads to the Threefold Training</a></h3>
<p>Of all the groups, classifications, or systems of practice that are
derived from the eight Path factors, the one that is considered the most
basic or all-inclusive, and which is used as a standard for spiritual
practice, is the system of the threefold training (<em>tisso sikkhā</em>).</p>
<p>The threefold training is derived from the Path, and in essence they are
the same. The Path is a system for living a virtuous life; one can say
that it is equivalent to the essence of a virtuous life. The threefold
training is a system of study or training for developing people in
virtue and for fostering a virtuous life.</p>
<p>These two teachings are connected, because spiritual training and
discipline gives rise to a virtuous life. When one practises according
to the threefold training, the Path arises; when people develop
themselves by the threefold training, their lives are in harmony with
the Path. In other words, one practises the threefold training in order
to give rise to the Path.</p>
<p>The gist of these two teachings is the same; by practising one, the
other prospers. Spiritual training, which is identical to spiritual
development, is an integral part of living a virtuous life; a virtuous
life springs from spiritual training.</p>
<p>When one has gained confidence in the Triple Gem, possessing faith
corresponding to right view, and one is no longer caught up in a
reliance on external conditions, the mind is intent on studying the
principle of bringing suffering to cessation by way of insight into
causes and conditions outlined in the Four Noble Truths. One then
undertakes the practice of the Eightfold Path, which is equivalent to
undertaking the threefold training. {868}</p>
<p>Faith in the Triple Gem assists in progressing in the threefold
training. One then develops the factors of the Path until one reaches
the goal.</p>
<p>The threefold training consists of the training in higher morality
(<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>), the training in higher mind (<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>),
and the training in higher wisdom (<em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>). For simplicity
and convenience, these factors are normally referred to as moral conduct
(<em>sīla</em>), concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).</p>
<p>Training in higher morality: virtuous physical actions, speech, and
livelihood, i.e. to develop the Path factors of right speech, right
action, and right livelihood. In essence, this refers to behaving well
in relation to society, honouring a moral code, and fulfilling one’s
social responsibilities. One relates to society in a beneficial way and
safeguards one’s environment – especially the social environment – so
that it is conducive for every person to live a virtuous life and
practise according to the Path. (See
Note <a href="#note-morality-relationships">Morality as Proper Relationships</a>)</p>
<p><em>Sīla</em> is the most basic form of training. It has a very wide range of
application and can be separated into many levels, encompassing all
outward behaviour, all acts of restraint in relation to other people,
and all relationships one maintains to one’s environment, both social
and natural. The most fundamental level of moral conduct is to refrain
from harming other people (including not harming oneself) and from
damaging a social environment conducive to virtue and the practice of
the Path.</p>
<p>From this stage one can train in forms of moral discipline that foster
higher virtues. If possible, one then engages in activities that help
other people, creates an environment that prevents evil, and increases
the opportunity for people to live and practise in order to generate
increasing degrees of goodness.</p>
<p>Training in higher mind: to cultivate the quality and capability of the
mind; to develop the Path factors of right effort, right mindfulness,
and right concentration. Essentially, this means making the mind strong,
steady and stable, maintaining self-restraint, and being concentrated
and highly motivated. The mind becomes peaceful, bright, joyous, pure,
and free from agitation or defilement. It is in the most optimum state
for work, especially for the application of profound wisdom.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Morality as Proper Relationships</span><a id="note-morality-relationships"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is very unfortunate that people tend to view morality (<em>sīla</em>) as
something exclusively negative – as a set of prohibitions or as a
form of restraint, for example by refraining from transgressing the
five precepts.</p>
<p>People do not see the wider meaning of this term as described in the
scriptures. For example, in reference to the monastic sangha, <em>sīla</em>
encompasses the correct relationship between teachers and disciples,
as described in the Mahākhandhaka and other sections of the Vinaya
Piṭaka.</p>
<p>In reference to the laity, <em>sīla</em> includes the proper relationship
between parents and children, husbands and wives, friends with
friends, etc, and includes the bases of social solidarity
(<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>) according to the householder’s discipline in the
Siṅgālaka Sutta.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Training in higher wisdom: to cultivate wisdom in order to generate an
understanding of things as they truly are, culminating in liberation, at
which time the mind is perfectly free, bright, and happy; to develop the
Path factors of right view and right thought. In essence, this refers to
cultivating pure wisdom, which clearly understands the truth. It is not
the kind of knowledge or intelligence that is warped, impaired, stained,
deceived, or confused by the power of defilements, most notably
ignorance and craving.</p>
<p>As a basis, developing this higher wisdom requires the training in
cleansing and brightening the mind. At the same time, however, when pure
wisdom arises, the mind becomes decidedly more tranquil, stable, pure,
and bright. Most importantly, wisdom leads to liberation. Wisdom also
has an overall effect on one’s life, in that one relates to things
correctly. One applies this pure, unbiased wisdom, which is unimpaired
by covert defilements, to solve problems and to act for the true welfare
and happiness of oneself and others. {869}</p>
<p>Using the terminology of contemporary scholars or of Western academics,
the trainings in higher morality, mind, and wisdom comprise social
development, emotional or mental development, and intellectual
development, respectively. These definitions differ only in the range of
application, although it should be stated here that the objective of the
threefold training is specific to the context of Buddha-Dhamma.</p>
<p>These definitions are basically consistent in that it is necessary to
train people to be disciplined (including to have a sense of social
responsibility and to have a positive relationship to society), to
cultivate their state of mind (to empower and refine the mind), and to
develop awakened intelligence and wisdom – <em>buddhi-paññā</em> – beginning
with the ability to reason.</p>
<p>Modern theories of human development agree that these three levels of
training are interrelated and mutually supportive, confirming for
instance that reasoned intelligence assists the development of one’s
overall state of mind, strengthens one’s sense of discipline, and
increases a sense of social responsibility. These three trainings, or
the three forms of human development, must therefore be practised in
unison. (See
Note <a href="#note-physical">Physical Development</a>)</p>
<p>Note that the Buddhist teaching on the four kinds of development
(<em>bhāvanā</em>) contains the extra factor of physical development
(<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn16-1"><a href="#fn-fn16">16</a></sup> The term ’physical development’ in this context,
however, differs from how it is used in modern parlance. In Buddhism,
this term refers to developing one’s relationship to one’s environment
by way of one’s physical body, giving rise to favourable results. It
does not refer to actually developing or improving the body. Moreover,
this concept is used to evaluate people’s spiritual progress. In the
context of practical application, physical development is classified as
part of the training in higher morality (<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>).</p>
<p>In sum, the threefold training is a gradual system whereby one focuses
first on external, coarse, and relatively easy factors, and then turns
one’s attention to internal, refined, and difficult or profound
qualities.</p>
<p>The beginning stages of training require at least a small trace or seed
of correct understanding, which is referred to as right view
(<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>), enough to know where to commence and where one is
heading, and to recognize the Path. The basic meaning of right view is
to understand the nature of one’s problems and to discern phenomena in
accord with truth.</p>
<p>The common, external training on the level of moral conduct acts as a
basis for refined, internal practice, preparing people for effective
training on the levels of the mind and wisdom.</p>
<p>And conversely, when one has trained at these refined levels, the fruits
of this practice help a person’s life in the external world, e.g.:
honest, upright behaviour becomes more stable; virtuous conduct becomes
automatic and natural – one need not force oneself to keep moral
principles; and one reflects on and addresses problems with pure wisdom.</p>
<p>As described earlier, when one fulfils the threefold training, one’s
entire way of life is consistent with the Path, and all the factors –
both those focusing on external things and those focusing on spiritual
qualities – function in harmony. {870}</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Physical Development</span><a id="note-physical"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that physical development in the context of Buddhist training is
not described as a separate factor, for it is assigned to the stage of
moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>). A Buddhist way of life is not in conflict with
or alienated from nature, but is rather in a healthy, harmonious
relationship to it. Furthermore, in the principle of morality
consisting in restraint of the senses (<em>indriyasaṁvara-sīla</em>) the
Buddha emphasizes the link between the body and one’s external
environment; moreover, he emphasizes the connection between a person’s
inner or spiritual life and his or her consumption of material things,
as described in the teaching on virtue called conduct related to the
four requisites (<em>paccayasannissita-sīla</em>), the teaching on consuming
things in moderation (<em>bhojane-mattaññutā</em>), and the teachings on
favourable conditions (<em>sappāya</em>).</p>
<p>Buddhism does not separate the development of the body from general
virtuous conduct, because on its own developing a strong and healthy
body does not comprise an essential training. Moreover, physical
training usually inclines towards providing craving with a means for
pursuing and indulging in sense pleasures, which is an opposite
pursuit to spiritual training. Although physical development is not
specified in the Three Trainings, it is part of the Four Cultivations
(<em>bhāvanā</em>): cf.: A. III. 105-6.</p>

<h2 id="buddhist-way-of-solving-problems"><a class="header" href="#buddhist-way-of-solving-problems">Buddhist Way of Solving Problems</a></h2>
<p>Some people understand that Buddhism teaches that every kind of problem,
including economic and social problems, should be solved exclusively in
the mind. They claim that such an attempt to solve problems is unlikely
to be adequate or truly effective.</p>
<p>To address this claim, one should focus on two separate issues: key
Buddhist principles for solving problems and those teachings on
problem-solving which are given emphasis or prominence.</p>
<p>Key principles: there are two important attributes to the Buddhist way
of solving problems: to solve problems at their source and to solve
problems through human ingenuity. Combining these, people are encouraged
to solve problems by themselves, by dealing directly with the causes and
conditions for these problems.</p>
<p>Dealing directly with the causes and conditions is non-specific; it
refers to both internal and external causes. In light of personal
responsibility, the Buddha encouraged people to first focus on
themselves when encountering a problem. They should not focus on
external causes or solutions, by say focusing on celestial forces or on
fate. Rather than depend on praying to a higher power or marking time
waiting for destiny, people should actively engage with the causes and
conditions lying behind their difficulties.</p>
<p>Prominent teachings: Buddhism teaches to solve both internal and
external problems, both social and spiritual problems. The teachings on
the level of moral conduct address external matters, while those on the
levels of mental development and wisdom address internal matters.</p>
<p>According to the main emphasis of the teachings, or the amount of
subject material in the scriptures, it is evident that more attention is
given to addressing internal or spiritual problems than to external or
social problems.</p>
<p>This is normal and appropriate for the following reasons:</p>
<h3 id="the-constancy-of-human-nature"><a class="header" href="#the-constancy-of-human-nature">The constancy of human nature</a></h3>
<p>For the most part, internal or spiritual problems are matters connected
to human nature. In other words, the basic features of mental problems
are identical for people in every place and at every time period.
Regardless of different cultures and different eras, the nature of the
human mind remains the same. Human beings universally possess greed,
hatred, and delusion; moreover, they cherish happiness and are averse to
suffering.</p>
<p>In terms of external or social problems, some aspects of these are tied
up with human nature – as long as one is human certain kinds of social
problems are inevitable. Many kinds of social problems, however, are
dependent on environmental factors, the details of which vary greatly
according to time and place.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that the Buddha primarily taught about solving
internal, spiritual problems. As for teachings on moral conduct – on
solving external problems – the Buddha taught general principles that
are linked to human nature, e.g.: to abstain from verbally or physically
injuring others, and to abstain from violating others’ possessions or
cherished objects; and to offer mutual assistance and support. Further
details of these problems are dependent on various environmental,
regional, and temporal factors. It is up to people who understand the
general principles of solving problems to then establish moral codes and
methods for addressing specific situations, according to attendant
causes and conditions. In these cases, is not a matter of laying down
fixed rules applicable to all people. {871}</p>
<p>An example of addressing specific circumstances is the Buddha’s express
system of dealing with social issues in the context of the bhikkhu
sangha, which he had established himself. The Buddha laid down the
monastic discipline (Vinaya), which is an intricate system of attending
to social issues, consistent with the unique aims of the monastic
community and suitable for its stability amidst the surrounding
conditions at that time.</p>
<p>Contemporary Buddhist scholars tend to overlook the Vinaya. If one
comprehends the gist of the Vinaya, however, one will understand the
Buddhist notion of attending to social issues. Indeed, if one does not
study the Vinaya Piṭaka (especially the subject material distinct from
the Pāṭimokkha), it is not possible to properly understand the Buddhist
outlook on society.</p>
<p>It is unreasonable to expect the Buddha to have established a
comprehensive code of conduct for the general public, disregarding the
fluctuations and changes that occur according to time and place. Those
people who understand the essential Buddhist teachings on outward
conduct are able to establish a system by themselves for dealing with
their particular social questions and problems.</p>
<p>For example, when King Asoka wished to consolidate the Dhammavinaya in
his empire, he did not need to meddle with the Buddhist teachings on
internal, spiritual matters; he simply propagated the true teachings on
these matters in a way suitable to that time period. In relation to
external, social matters, however, he drew upon general Buddhist
principles and then set down new standards and customs of rulership and
enterprise that were effective and appropriate for his time.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Thailand, in relation to traditions of royal governance,
general Buddhist teachings on the responsibilities of the monarchy have
been determined as the essential principles, and their meaning
interpreted to suit the contemporary era. Examples for such teachings
include the ten royal virtues (<em>rāja-dhamma</em>), the twelve duties of a
great ruler (<em>cakkavatti-vatta</em>), the four royal acts of service
(<em>rāja-saṅgahavatthu</em>), and the five strengths (<em>bala</em>) of a king.
Likewise, systems of government administration have been formed and
established appropriate to the specific time and place.</p>
<h3 id="prioritization-and-unique-understanding"><a class="header" href="#prioritization-and-unique-understanding">Prioritization and unique understanding</a></h3>
<p>The solving of external, social problems is generally seen as a priority
by academics and by various scholarly institutions. On the contrary,
spiritual matters and the development of human wisdom gets relatively
little attention by scholars, who often do not appreciate its
significance.</p>
<p>Buddhism considers spiritual matters to be of vital importance. The more
these matters are neglected by general scholarly circles, the more
attention they deserve. Moreover, Buddhism offers a unique insight into
these matters.</p>
<h3 id="profundity-complexity-and-true-importance"><a class="header" href="#profundity-complexity-and-true-importance">Profundity, complexity, and true importance</a></h3>
<p>Spiritual matters are profound, refined, and much more difficult to
comprehend than external problems. In comparison to social issues, it
may take ten times longer to explain spiritual matters, which need to be
repeatedly underscored. For this reason it is normal that the scriptures
contain more teachings on spiritual matters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Buddha considered spiritual wellbeing to be the true
purpose of human life. Having been born as a human being, one should try
and reach this state of wellbeing and not live one’s life in vain.
People generally do not recognize the importance and subtleties of
spirituality and thus its details need to be reiterated and emphasized.
{872}</p>
<p>Moreover, people are already keenly engaged in seeking external or
material wellbeing; even if one does not stress this form of wellbeing,
it will still be sought after.</p>
<h3 id="the-interconnectedness-of-all-facets-of-life"><a class="header" href="#the-interconnectedness-of-all-facets-of-life">The interconnectedness of all facets of life</a></h3>
<p>All human problems, both internal and external, have an impact on each
other, and when solving these problems all areas of a person’s life must
be taken into account and be in tune with one another.</p>
<p>An understanding of this is especially valuable when one recognizes that
a person’s spiritual life is of chief and fundamental importance and
plays a crucial role in solving external problems. If the mind is
infatuated with something, for example, one does not see associated
problems accurately. When thinking is dominated by ignorance and
craving, or when it is distorted by conceit and fixed opinions, one is
unable to reflect on problems correctly. Besides solving problems in a
wrong manner, one may intensify them or create new problems.</p>
<p>For this reason, cleansing the mind and purifying wisdom – clearing up
distortion and prejudice – is necessary for solving all kinds of
problems, internal and external, irrespective of time and place.</p>
<p>If people are unable to address internal, spiritual problems, they will
be unable to effectively solve external, social problems. But if they
can resolve fundamental spiritual problems, the task of dealing with
external problems will be greatly simplified. Their skill and readiness
to address all kinds of problems will be enhanced.</p>
<h3 id="different-levels-of-conducting-ones-life"><a class="header" href="#different-levels-of-conducting-ones-life">Different levels of conducting one’s life</a></h3>
<p>Buddhism recognizes that human society consists of people at different
stages of spiritual development. Moreover, it recognizes distinctions in
how people live, for example the difference between the lay community
and the monastic sangha, which provides an opportunity for certain
individuals to voluntarily live a unique way of life.</p>
<p>The life of a layperson emphasizes social relationships and earning a
livelihood; the monastic life emphasizes spiritual practice. Although
the Vinaya provides methods for addressing social issues, the monastic
life gives relatively more emphasis to a person’s internal life. For
this reason, it would be inappropriate to use the teachings addressed to
monks as a measuring stick for the universal Buddhist outlook on dealing
with problems.</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-all-sentient-beings"><a class="header" href="#the-nature-of-all-sentient-beings">The nature of all sentient beings</a></h3>
<p>One tenet of Buddhism is that human beings rely on spiritual
cultivation. At any one time, it is natural that different individuals
are at varying levels of development, in terms of physical development,
interpersonal development, mental development, and wisdom development.
Different people thus have different needs, both in terms of material
needs and spiritual needs; they also have different requirements in
relation to happiness.</p>
<p>It is important that one acknowledges the differences between people and
recognizes how people exist at varying stages of spiritual development.
It is unrealistic and unhelpful to expect people to all be the same.</p>
<p>Individuals in positions of leadership and responsibility should see to
the material, social, and intellectual needs of people in their
communities, in a way that is fair and just. In this way, all
individuals, who are naturally at different stages of development, will
abide in peace and happiness. {873}</p>
<p>And vitally, one needs to satisfy the shared need of all human beings –
of the need for spiritual development. One needs to establish social
frameworks, even on a global scale, that are conducive and favourable to
the spiritual development of all people, so that they have the
opportunity to realize the highest goals of the spiritual life, even to
the point of cultivating perfect wisdom.</p>
<p>If one fulfils these requirements, one is in harmony with the principles
of Buddhism.</p>
<h3 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h3>
<p>In sum, Buddhism teaches people to solve problems by themselves, by
dealing directly with their causes and conditions. And this injunction
is non-specific: it covers both internal and external problems,
according to the circumstances.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the formal study of the arts and sciences and other
academic pursuits focus solely on solving external problems; they almost
completely neglect spiritual matters, which results in incomplete or
defective solutions for human dilemmas.</p>
<p>One can say that the Buddhist way of solving problems does not
exclusively deal with either internal or external matters, but that it
begins its focus inwardly and then moves outward. One must solve all
problems – both internal and external – and solve them at their root
causes.</p>
<h2 id="outstanding-benefits-of-the-four-noble-truths"><a class="header" href="#outstanding-benefits-of-the-four-noble-truths">Outstanding Benefits of the Four Noble Truths</a></h2>
<p>Besides incorporating the entire spectrum of Buddhist teachings, both
theoretical and practical, the teaching of the Four Noble Truths
provides many other benefits, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is a way of wisdom; it promotes the solving of problems according
to a systematic and reasoned procedure; it is a classic model: any
effective, rational, and practical method for solving problems must
proceed consistent with the Four Noble Truths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a method for people to solve problems and manage their life by
way of their own wisdom, by applying and benefiting from truths
inherent in nature. One need not depend on divine, sacred or
supernatural powers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are truths relevant to everyone; no matter how broadly or
extensively people engage with things, if they wish to have dignity
and to relate to things effectively, they need to embrace and
benefit from these truths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are universal, timeless truths directly connected to human
life; no matter what forms of technical knowledge or enterprises
people create in order to solve problems and improve their lives,
and no matter to what extent these forms of knowledge and activities
prosper, decline, pass away, or are replaced by newer forms, the
Four Noble Truths endure, are up-to-date, and can be applied to
benefit one’s life at all times. {874}</p>

<p>Some of the material in <em>Buddhadhamma</em> may seem unusual, especially
passages explaining unfamiliar terms like external instruction
(<em>paratoghosa</em>), virtuous friends (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>), and wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), or explanations of unique and unfamiliar aspects
of common teachings, which are generally not found in other Dhamma
books.</p>
<p>These special terms and aspects, however, are frequently mentioned in
the Tipiṭaka; it simply happens that in some time periods Buddhist
scholars and teachers have no need or reason to emphasize them, and they
therefore become less conspicuous.</p>
<p>The reason this subject material has been included in this book is
because now seems to be the right time to give special, renewed
importance to these terms and meanings.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some people may remark that other teachings that I
have emphasized and elaborated on in the past have not been given
prominence in this text.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, the author of this book is confident that the
proportion of subject material in relation to special terms and aspects
is close to the proportion contained in the Pali Canon, which is the
original source of the principal Buddhist teachings.</p>

<h3 id="middle-teaching-majjhena-dhammadesanā-the-dynamics-of-nature"><a class="header" href="#middle-teaching-majjhena-dhammadesanā-the-dynamics-of-nature">Middle Teaching (majjhena-dhammadesanā): the Dynamics of Nature</a></h3>
<p>According to Buddha-Dhamma, regardless of whether a Buddha appears in
the world or not, the truth exists in an objective way, following its
own nature. The Buddha simply discovered this truth and revealed it to
others. The gist of this truth is that things exist according to a
natural causal process – a dynamic of causes and conditions.</p>
<p>Those people who discern things as they truly are, rather than according
to how they want them to be, gain insight into this objective truth.
From this insight they derive a comprehensive understanding of truth and
a broad vision of phenomena. They arrive at true liberation, freed both
in regard to the mind – the mind is freed from suffering and from
oppressive defilements, and is marked by peace and joy – and in regard
to wisdom – they are liberated by way of thorough knowledge, gaining
insight into pure, unadulterated truth. They are devoid of obstructive,
distorting mental defilements, attaining an awakened, immediate
understanding of truth. Their understanding is firsthand; it need not be
relayed through someone else.</p>
<p>This natural causal process manifests in many forms, as is outlined in
the various laws of nature, e.g.: physical laws (<em>utu-niyāma</em>), the law
of kamma (<em>kamma-niyāma</em>), and general laws of nature (<em>dhamma-niyāma</em>):</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Mode of Physical Conditionality; Dynamics of the Natural
Environment</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The summit of Mount Kailash is very high → the air is very cold → it
snows throughout the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Harvey gets stuck in the snow for a long time → blood flow is
reduced due to the cold temperatures → inadequate blood reaches his
fingers and toes → his fingers and toes ache and become numb → he
suffers frostbite → he is crippled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Mode of Karmic Conditionality on the Level of the Mind</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>A Clock Strikes 10am</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mr. Adams (a prisoner, whose time of execution has arrived) hears it
→ he experiences fear → he is weak in the knees and unable to stand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Barrington (a relative of the person killed by Mr. Adams) hears
it → his thirst for revenge is slaked → he shouts with joy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Chadwick (another relative of the deceased) hears it → he is
angry but he reflects on human actions and their results
(<em>kamma-vipāka</em>), and thus feels sadness → he is reserved and quiet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Dmitry (another prisoner about to be executed) hears it → he was
previously afraid, but he considers the just deserts of his actions
→ he walks peacefully alongside the prison guard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Mode of Karmic Conditionality on the Level of the Individual</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Evans swears at Mr. Fisher → Mr. Fisher whacks Mr. Evans over
the head with a stick → Mr. Evans suffers a head wound → Mr. Evans
takes a gun and shoots Mr. Fisher → Mr. Fisher is critically
wounded, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Mode of Karmic Conditionality on the Level of Society</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>People harvest food that has grown naturally in nature → some
individuals hoard up this food → others follow their example →
people stake out personal property → people steal from others →
mutual accusations and violence → people recognize the need for
social governance → a leader is elected → the origin of a king, etc.
(this outline follows the content in the Aggañña Sutta). {877}</li>
</ul>
<p>Mode B (karmic conditionality on the level of the mind) has unique
characteristics. If one only looks at the external phenomena, without
referring to the qualities in the minds of these individuals, one is
unable to explain the relationship between the cause and effect, i.e.
the connection between hearing the bell from the clock and the
consequent behaviour. If the conditions in the mind do not exist, the
external behaviour does not arise.</p>
<p>In modes C and D the factors within an individual are also very important,
but they are concealed or less conspicuous, and tend to be overlooked.
For instance, some people in such circumstances only notice the material
or economic factors. Here, mode B has been placed aside these other
modes in order to demonstrate the importance of internal factors, which
play a participatory role, either in a supportive or a conflicting way,
in these natural causal processes.</p>
<p>Mode B is a constant and unavoidable dynamic in people’s lives. It is
initiated and its results are experienced exclusively by an individual.
It is a vital and urgent matter, which every person should come to grips
with and gain mastery over within this lifetime, even if they are
simultaneously trying to cope with other dynamics inherent in nature.</p>
<h3 id="middle-path-majjhimā-paṭipadā-methods-for-practical-application"><a class="header" href="#middle-path-majjhimā-paṭipadā-methods-for-practical-application">Middle Path (majjhimā-paṭipadā): Methods for Practical Application</a></h3>
<p>The Middle Path, or Middle Way, refers to a way of living one’s life
with wisdom. Here, one applies one’s understanding of the objective
truth outlined in the Middle Teaching (<em>majjhena-dhammadesanā</em>). Devoid
of such understanding, one falls under the power of unhealthy desire,
fosters vague ideas about how things should be, and entrusts one’s
happiness to craving.</p>
<p>At the beginning of one’s practice, before one has fully realized this
truth, one relies on faith and on those beliefs that are in concord with
the principle of causality. One is responsible for acting with reasoned
discernment, and one seeks success through one’s own volitional actions
(this is the stage of mundane right view – <em>lokiya-sammādiṭṭhi</em>).</p>
<p>On a higher level, when one has fully realized this truth, attained
liberation, and been freed from suffering and from the affliction by
mental defilements, one abides with a complete and thorough insight into
the nature of causality (this is the level of transcendent right view –
<em>lokuttara-sammādiṭṭhi</em>). Here, one follows the Buddhist way of life
(<em>buddhacariya-dhamma</em>). One lives the supreme life (<em>brahmacariya</em>) and
abides in harmony with Buddha-Dhamma. One walks the noble path
(<em>ariya-magga</em>): the noble way of the awakened ones, of solving life’s
dilemmas.</p>
<p>There is an important distinction between awakened and unawakened
individuals. The regular disposition of awakened beings is one of
happiness and a freedom from suffering. Alternatively, one may say that
awakened beings are released from suffering and have transcended
happiness. Unawakened beings, on the other hand, must constantly pursue
happiness, because they possess a shortage of it or they are assailed by
suffering.</p>
<p>The Path leading to the end of suffering comprises eight factors.
These factors are presented as a threefold process of training and
spiritual development:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em>: training in behaviour that fosters a virtuous society, which
is supportive of a good quality of life for people and conducive to
mind and wisdom development. Here, one establishes a moral code,
cultivates rectitude of body and speech, and engages in right
livelihood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samādhi</em>: based on such a virtuous and conducive society,
environment, and lifestyle, one develops mental refinement,
strength, capability, and health.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paññā</em>: by way of such a favourable state of mind, one is able to
cultivate wisdom, giving rise to a comprehensive understanding of
cause and effect. One’s actions are guided by this understanding
until one reaches direct insight and liberation, abiding in constant
ease and joy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This training and development relies on two supportive factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Paratoghosa</em>: external factors linked to faith; favourable
environmental influences, in particular virtuous friends
(<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yoniso-manasikāra</em>: internal factors linked to wisdom; skilled
reflection; wise reflection. {878}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These various factors may be outlined as illustrated on
Figure <a href="#fig-training-and-development">Training and Development</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">Training and Development</span><a id="fig-training-and-development"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/training-and-development.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>’Old kamma’ is defined as the six senses – the eyes, ears, nose,
tongue, body, and mind – which act as the principal agents to start
with on the spiritual path.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn18-1"><a href="#fn-fn18">18</a></sup> From this point, spiritual training
relies on external influences and instruction (<em>paratoghosa</em>), which may
be summed up by the saying: ’people are shaped and moulded by their
environment’, and on wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), which may be
summed up by the saying: ’If one is skilled at reflection, one may
achieve arahantship even by listening to the words of drunks and
madmen.’</p>
<p>When one applies the method of detailed analysis (<em>vibhajja-vidhi</em>),
those ethical quandaries that are difficult to solve, for instance: ’Is
it moral or immoral for a child to steal money in order to buy medicine
for his sick mother?’ become clear and are no longer a cause for doubt
and confusion.</p>
<p>External influence on its own is insufficient for realizing the truth
(<em>sacca-dhamma</em>); wise reflection is the decisive factor.</p>
<p>The two levels of right view reveal the range of human mental activity,
which can be separated into two domains:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wisdom (<em>paññā</em>)/insight (<em>ñāṇa</em>)/true knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>), whereby
ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>) is severed: this is equivalent to transcendent
right view (<em>lokuttara-sammādiṭṭhi</em>), and pertains to knowledge,
truth, science, the principle of life, and natural laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faith (<em>saddhā</em>)/wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>)/compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>),
whereby craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) is severed: this is equivalent to mundane
right view (<em>lokiya-sammādiṭṭhi</em>), and pertains to values, morality,
practical arts, human behaviour, individuality, and society.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that from a broad perspective the meaning of the term
’Buddha-Dhamma’ is restricted and does not encompass the entirety of
Buddhism. The original term with an all-embracing meaning is
’Dhammavinaya’.</p>
<p>This volume discusses the Dhamma at length and is thus aptly titled
<em>Buddhadhamma</em>, but it only briefly discusses the Vinaya. Perhaps there
ought to be a companion volume to this text titled <em>Ariya-Vinaya</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn19-1"><a href="#fn-fn19">19</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dhamma</em>: teachings on truth and virtue, pertaining to essential
truths and principles, to matters discovered and revealed by the
Buddha. They emphasize the internal, spiritual life of an
individual. (They aim to solve and prevent personal problems and to
foster internal growth.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vinaya</em>: codes of conduct and the establishment of such codes. The
term <em>vinaya</em> pertains to social systems and conventions, ways of
practice according with the aforementioned principles, disciplinary
precepts, and the laying down of laws. A <em>vinaya</em> is an instrument
for establishing a code of living or a social system that accords
with the objectives of the Dhamma. One draws upon the essential
principles of the Dhamma to set down a system of practice providing
truly effective results amidst the truth of the tangible world. A
<em>vinaya</em> emphasizes external behaviour, everyday life, one’s society
and environment, communal interrelationship, and one’s
responsibility to the common good. (It aims to solve and prevent
external problems and to foster communal prosperity.)</p>

Especially in relation to <em>pubbekata-vāda</em>, it is important to
distinguish this doctrine from the Buddhist teachings on kamma, a
distinction which it seems that many Buddhists do not pay proper
attention to. The scriptures emphasize this distinction and if it is
studied well it will lead to clarity on the Buddhist notion of
kamma. The commentaries at VbhA. 497 claim that the first doctrine
is that of the Nigaṇṭhā, the second of the brahmins, and the third
of the Ājīvakas. At J. V. 239-41 the doctrine of annihilationism

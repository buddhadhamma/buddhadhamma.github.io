<h2><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>In Pali, the word <em>samatha</em> means ‘calm’ or ‘tranquil’, but the term
generally refers to the actual methods of generating tranquillity and of
developing a deeply concentrated mind. The purpose of <em>samatha</em> is to
attain the meditative absorptions (<em>jhāna</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> In <em>samatha</em> practice
one fixes one’s mind on an object (<em>ārammaṇa</em>) until the mind is
one-pointed, which is called <em>samādhi</em> (concentration). When
concentration is properly established the mind enters one of the jhānas.
In the four fine-material jhānas (<em>rūpa-jhāna</em> or simply <em>jhāna</em>) one
uses aspects of materiality as the object of attention. More refined
than these are the four formless jhānas (<em>arūpa-jhāna</em>), in which one
uses immaterial objects as the object of attention. Together these
jhānas are called the eight ‘attainments’ (<em>samāpatti</em>).</p>
<p>In jhāna the mind is happy, peaceful and bright; there is no dullness or
disturbance; the mind is free from the hindrances (<em>nīvaraṇa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> For
the duration of jhāna, one is said to be free from the mental
defilements (<em>kilesa</em>). The defilements return, however, when one exits
jhāna. The terms ‘cessation as suppression’ (<em>vikkhambhana-nirodha</em>) and
‘liberation as suppression’ (<em>vikkhambhana-vimutti</em>) are used for this
suppression of defilement by concentration. Possible fruits of jhāna are
the five special powers (<em>abhiññā</em>): psychic power, telepathy,
recollection of past lives, divine ear, and divine eye. (See
Note <a href="#note-higher-knowledge">Higher Knowledge</a>)</p>
<p>The word <em>samatha</em> often refers specifically to concentration
(<em>samādhi</em>). Equating <em>samatha</em> with <em>samādhi</em> is in accord with both
the Abhidhamma and the suttas, for no matter which special powers or
attainments a person reaches, the essence of tranquillity meditation is
concentration.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> {427}</p>
<p><em>Vipassanā</em> means ‘clear insight’. The term also refers to methods of
cultivating wisdom in order to see the truth, to see things clearly as
they are, not as one imagines them to be with a vision distorted by
desire and aversion. This insight deepens until ignorance and attachment
are uprooted, at which point one’s impressions, perceptions and
attitudes are transformed.</p>
<p>The knowledge that gradually increases during this practice of insight
is called <em>ñāṇa</em>, of which there are many levels. The final and highest
knowledge is called <em>vijjā</em>, which completely eradicates ignorance. A
mind endowed with such knowledge is joyous, peaceful and free. It
escapes the clutches of defilements, which corrupt people’s thoughts and
actions. An awakened person is not afflicted by defilements and need not
struggle against them. This knowledge is the aim of insight meditation
(<em>vipassanā</em>) and it leads to true and lasting liberation. This absolute
liberation is called ‘cessation as severance’ (<em>samuccheda-nirodha</em>) or
‘liberation as severance’ (<em>samuccheda-vimutti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Higher Knowledge</span><a id="note-higher-knowledge"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trans.: the term <em>abhiññā</em> is used in different contexts. In general
it means ‘higher knowledge’, ‘supreme knowledge’. There are six kinds
of supreme knowledge. The first five (listed above) are mundane forms
of knowledge; the sixth kind – knowledge of the destruction of the
taints (<em>āsavakkhaya-ñāṇa</em>) – is transcendent. In this chapter, when
referring to the first five kinds I use the terms ‘special power’,
‘supernormal power’, ‘supreme power’, or ‘higher psychic attainments’;
in reference to all six kinds I use the terms ‘supreme knowledge’,
‘supreme attainment’, or ‘direct knowledge’.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The goal of tranquillity meditation is jhāna; the goal of insight
meditation is <em>ñāṇa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> People can practise solely <em>samatha</em>
meditation, wishing to enjoy the fruits of such practice: the jhānas and
the supreme powers (<em>abhiññā</em>). They may stop here, not concerning
themselves with insight meditation and the development of wisdom. But a
person practising insight meditation must rely on some level of
concentration. They may attain jhāna first and use jhāna as a basis for
insight, they may practise insight first and then practise tranquillity,
or they may practise both forms of meditation simultaneously. Those who
are called ‘practitioners of pure insight’ (<em>suddhavipassanā-yānika</em>) do
not practise tranquillity in a ‘direct’ or ‘exclusive’ way – they do
not attain jhāna before developing insight – but they still depend on
tranquillity in a broad sense: they still depend on concentration. The
initial concentration of someone practising insight may be ‘temporary’
(<em>khaṇika-samādhi</em>). But at the point of attaining path and fruit
(<em>magga-phala</em>), concentration is firmly established (’attainment
concentration’ – <em>appanā-samādhi</em>), reaching at least the first jhāna.</p>
<p>However extraordinary the jhānas or psychic powers may be, if they
result exclusively from tranquillity meditation they are still
‘mundane’: they lie within the domain of unawakened beings.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> Examples
of such accomplishments are the psychic powers of Ven. Devadatta,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>
the temporary emancipation of Ven. Godhika,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup> and the stories in the
texts of monks, rishis and laypeople who attained jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> {428}</p>
<p>Concentrative attainments and supernormal powers resulting from
tranquillity meditation were accessible before the Buddha’s time.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup>
Those individuals who achieved these attainments came from other
religious traditions and preceded the Buddha, for example Āḷāra Kālāma
who reached the third formless jhāna and Uddaka Rāmaputta who attained
the fourth formless jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> These attainments are not the goal of
Buddhism since they do not bring about true deliverance from suffering
and defilement. There were monks of other traditions who having attained
the four jhānas maintained wrong view and claimed that abiding in these
jhānas is equivalent to Nibbāna, a claim the Buddha repudiated.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>The true purpose of tranquillity meditation in Buddhism is to generate
concentration to use as a basis for insight. (See
Note <a href="#note-tranquillity-for-insight">Tranquillity for Insight</a>) A cultivation of this
insight supported by concentration leads to the final goal of Buddhism.
Someone with the special quality of reaching this highest goal and being
endowed with the exceptional fruits of tranquillity meditation will be
admired and revered. But someone who has attained only the fruits of
insight is still superior to someone who has attained jhānas and psychic
powers yet remains unawakened. The concentration of non-returners who
have not achieved the eight jhānas or the five supreme powers
(<em>abhiññā</em>) is still considered ‘complete’. It is secure and steadfast
since no defilements exist to erode or disturb it. This is not true of
those who attain jhāna or psychic powers but do not cultivate insight or
attain path and fruit (<em>magga-phala</em>). Although their level of
concentration may be exceptional, there is no guarantee of its
stability. They are still susceptible to being overwhelmed by
defilement. Even the concentration of stream-enterers and once-returners
can be disturbed and weakened by sensual lust. Their <em>samādhi</em> is
therefore still considered ‘incomplete’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>This subject of calm and insight is connected to the deliverance by
wisdom and deliverance of mind discussed below. {429}</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Tranquillity for Insight</span><a id="note-tranquillity-for-insight"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The supreme concentration is that which aids wisdom in dispelling the
defilements and facilitates awakening. Technically speaking it is a
factor in the Path (<em>magga-samādhi</em>). This concentration has a special
name: <em>ānantarika-samādhi</em> (also spelled <em>anantarika</em>, <em>anantariya</em> or
<em>ānantariya</em>), translated as ‘following immediately’ – it produces
immediate <em>ariya-phala</em>, without interference. The Buddha said this
concentration is peerless (Kh. 4; Sn. 40). Even if this concentration
is of a lower level, it is still superior to other forms of
fine-material and immaterial jhānas. (KhA. 182; SnA. I. 277).
<em>Ānantarika-samādhi</em> is mentioned in other contexts, both in the Canon
and the commentaries; see: D. III. 273; A. II. 150; Ps1. 2, 94;
DA. III. 1056; AA. III. 139; PsA. I. 37; VismṬ.:
Ñāṇadassanavisuddhiniddesavaṇṇanā, Sotāpannapuggalakathāvaṇṇanā;

<p>Earlier, liberation (<em>vimutti</em>) was mentioned as a synonym for Nibbāna
and also discussed in the section on the attributes of awakened beings.
Here, we will examine the term <em>vimutti</em> more closely. In the
commentaries, the term <em>vimutti</em> in its highest sense has three distinct
definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Vimutti</em> as the Path (<em>magga</em>): the act of liberation; the existing
conditions at the moment of liberation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vimutti</em> as fruition (<em>phala</em>): the freedom resulting from
liberation; the result of being a liberated person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vimutti</em> as equivalent to Nibbāna: the state of a liberated person;
the nature of freedom reached and experienced by a liberated person,
providing such blessings as happiness, ease, contentment and peace;
the liberation unawakened people determine as an object of
contemplation and set as a goal.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these three definitions, the second one of <em>vimutti</em> as fruition is
the most specific and pertains to the essential meaning of liberation.
It refers here most often to the fruition of arahantship, when one
abandons all ten fetters (<em>saṁyojana</em>) and is released from all mental
taints (<em>āsava</em>). In the definition of <em>vimutti</em> as the Path, there are
additional agents, especially true knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>) and dispassion
(<em>virāga</em>), which are often paired with liberation. In such cases
<em>vijjā</em> or <em>virāga</em> are defined as the Path, while <em>vimutti</em> constitutes
the fruit. In the third definition <em>vimutti</em> is a synonym for Nibbāna.

<p><em>Vimutti</em> as fruition, especially as the fruit of arahantship, is
divided into two kinds: <em>cetovimutti</em> and <em>paññāvimutti</em>. <em>Cetovimutti</em>
is translated as ‘liberation of the mind’. It is the liberation made
possible through the strength of concentration. It is the state of a
concentrated mind, which quells passion and is free from the bonds of
defilement.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup> {430} <em>Paññāvimutti</em> is translated as ‘liberation
through wisdom’, but can equally be translated as ‘liberation of wisdom’
since it refers to the wisdom of an arahant that is purified and
perfected. This wisdom dispels ignorance and frees a person from
defilement.</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Liberation of the mind is achieved by abandoning lust; liberation by
wisdom is achieved by abandoning ignorance.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 61; Ps. II. 99.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The commentaries define <em>cetovimutti</em> as the concentration (<em>samādhi</em>)
which is the fruit of arahantship, and they define <em>paññāvimutti</em> as the
wisdom and knowledge which is the fruit of arahantship.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup> All persons
who have attained arahantship have completed these two kinds of
liberation. In passages referring to the attainment of arahantship these
two terms therefore always exist as a pair, for example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>With the destruction of the taints, one realizes for oneself with
direct knowledge here and now the deliverance of mind and deliverance
by wisdom that are taintless.</p>
<p><em>E.g.: D. I. 156, 167; D. II. 71, 251; D. III. 107, 132; M. I. 284,
367; S. IV. 267, 289; A. I. 220; A. III. 29, 425-6.</em> M. I. 284, 367;
S. IV. 267, 289; A. I. 220; A. III. 29, 425-6.&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><em>Cetovimutti</em> is the fruit of tranquillity; <em>paññāvimutti</em> is the fruit
of insight.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup> The commentaries assert that the appearance of these
two terms as a pair indicates that tranquillity and insight must be
combined, both at the level of ‘fruit’ (<em>phala</em>) and ‘path’
(<em>magga</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup> Tranquillity (<em>samatha</em>) here can be taken in a broad
sense as a required level of concentration; it need not refer to the
deeper levels of concentration resulting in the higher psychic
attainments.</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Two things pertain to supreme knowledge.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup> What two? Serenity and

Lust is abandoned.</p>
<p>When insight is developed, what benefit does it bring? Wisdom is

Ignorance is abandoned.</p>
<p>A mind defiled by lust is not liberated, and wisdom defiled by
ignorance is not developed. Thus, monks, through the removal of lust
there is liberation of mind, and through the removal of ignorance
there is liberation by wisdom. (See

<blockquote>
<p>In the Pali Canon the attainment of <em>cetovimutti</em> and <em>paññāvimutti</em>
is used as a definition for arahantship (e.g.: S. V. 406). This is
evidence that all arahants attain both of these kinds of liberation.
When these terms are used as a pair to refer to arahants, they are
always preceded by the term <em>anāsava</em> (’free from the taints’). The
passage at A. II. 87 mentions arahants who have attained <em>cetovimutti</em>
and <em>paññāvimutti</em> but have not attained the eight <em>vimokkha</em>
(<em>jhāna-samāpatti</em> and <em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>). This passage confirms
that the <em>cetovimutti</em> of an arahant refers to a necessary degree of
concentration in supporting wisdom in the eradication of the taints.
It is not the <em>cetovimutti</em> discussed below that refers to the eight
concentrative attainments (<em>jhāna-samāpatti</em>).</p>
<p>The commentaries define <em>samatha</em> as <em>cittekaggatā</em> (’one
pointedness’; <em>samādhi</em>), and define <em>vipassanā</em> as the knowledge that
reflects on conditioned phenomena (AA. II. 119).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Liberation is complete with the attainment of both <em>cetovimutti</em> and
<em>paññāvimutti</em>. It is possible to only practise tranquillity and this
practice can lead to the higher concentrative attainments in which the
defilements are suppressed. This is one kind of liberation albeit a
temporary one. In order to reach true liberation, however, a person
practising tranquillity must also integrate insight meditation. The term
<em>cetovimutti</em> can be used in contexts apart from the realization of path
and fruit, although in these contexts the liberation of the mind is not
absolute. The decisive factor is therefore <em>paññāvimutti</em>, which
gradually eliminates ignorance and eradicates the defilements. True
lasting liberation comes with <em>paññāvimutti</em>. The term <em>anāsava</em>
(’taintless’) is used in conjunction with these two terms to emphasize
perfect liberation. The term <em>cetovimutti</em> is used as a pair with
<em>paññāvimutti</em> simply to show that a high level of concentration is
required to prepare the mind for liberation by wisdom.</p>
<p><em>Paññāvimutti</em> is only used in the context of complete liberation and is
always accompanied by the term <em>cetovimutti</em>. <em>Cetovimutti</em> can be used
in other contexts. If it refers to the decisive liberation of path and
fruit, from stream-entry upwards, then it is paired with <em>paññāvimutti</em>.
Otherwise it must be accompanied by a qualifying adjective clearly
indicating a stage of definite awakening, for example: <em>akuppā</em>
(’unshakeable’) or <em>asamaya</em> (’lasting’). When found alone or
accompanied by other terms then it does not refer to complete
liberation.</p>
<p>Because of the similarity of the terms, the division of arahants into
‘one liberated by wisdom’ (<em>paññāvimutta</em>) and ‘one liberated both ways’
(<em>ubhatobhāgavimutta</em>) gives the impression that the former refers to
someone who has solely attained liberation by wisdom (<em>paññāvimutti</em>).
In fact, the attainment of <em>paññāvimutti</em> necessarily includes the
attainment of <em>cetovimutti</em> in the sense that a person relies on a
refined degree of concentration to attain liberation by wisdom. In this
case, concentration does not need to be highlighted. Even someone who
solely practises insight (<em>sukkha-vipassaka</em>) depends on tranquillity
meditation to develop a required degree of concentration. In the case of
‘one liberated in both ways’ (<em>ubhatobhāgavimutta</em>), liberation of the
mind (<em>cetovimutti</em>) is emphasized. The reason for this emphasis is
because the kind of <em>cetovimutti</em> referred to here is exceptional, of
the eight <em>vimokkha</em> or the higher attainments of jhāna.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the term <em>vimutti</em> is used in many different
contexts. The term <em>cetovimutti</em>, when referring to levels of liberation
that are not yet transcendent, is most often used on its own; in this
case it suggests a liberation that is not absolute. Inferior kinds of
liberation generally occur through the power of concentration. {432}
Later texts also use the term <em>vimokkha</em> when referring to
non-transcendent liberation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup> The original texts reserved a unique
definition for <em>vimokkha</em> as explained in the chapter on awakened
beings. Whichever term is used – <em>vimutti</em>, <em>cetovimutti</em> or <em>vimokkha</em>
– it is usually accompanied by a qualifying adjective to clarify the
context, for example: <em>sāmāyika-vimutti</em>, <em>sāmāyika-cetovimutti</em>,
<em>sāmāyika-vimokkha</em> (all meaning ‘temporary liberation’),
<em>appamaññā-cetovimutti</em> (’boundless liberation’), or <em>santa-cetovimutti</em>
(’peaceful liberation’). Replacing the qualifying adjectives of inferior
levels of liberation with adjectives of an opposite meaning denotes a
supreme form of liberation (for example, by replacing <em>sāmāyika</em> with
<em>asamaya</em>).</p>
<p><em>Vimutti</em> in a general sense can thus be divided into two kinds: as
absolute and not-absolute. When referring to its highest meaning, the
word <em>vimutti</em> is preceded by one of the following qualifying adjectives
to make it clear that the reference is to absolute, transcendent
liberation: <em>akuppā</em> (<em>akuppā-vimutti</em> &amp; <em>akuppā-cetovimutti</em>:
‘unshakeable liberation’; ‘non-degenerative liberation’);<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup> or
<em>asamaya</em> (<em>asamaya-vimutti</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup> &amp; <em>asāmāyika-cetovimutti</em>:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup>
‘lasting liberation’; ‘timeless liberation’). All these terms refer to
‘noble fruition’ (<em>ariya-phala</em>), especially to the fruit of
arahantship.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup> And since the term <em>cetovimutti</em> on its own never
refers to absolute liberation, the terms <em>akuppā</em> and <em>asāmāyika</em> are
added to indicate a liberation of mind that is absolute, not subject to
decay, and necessarily accompanied by liberation by wisdom. {433}</p>
<p>Another transcendent form of <em>cetovimutti</em> accessible to awakened beings
is the ‘signless liberation of mind’ (<em>animittā-cetovimutti</em>), which is
known as a ‘fruition attainment’ (<em>phala-samāpatti</em>). This is reached
when stream-enterers, once-returners, non-returners and arahants wish to
abide at ease and enter a state of concentration, experiencing the
<em>rasa</em> (’flavour’; ‘quality’) of their realization. This state of
liberation is an ‘abiding at ease in the present’
(<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>) and a ‘noble, transcendent bliss’
(<em>ariyalokuttara-sukha</em>). It is called ‘signless liberation of mind’
because it is a freedom of mind wherein the person takes no notice of
signs and features belonging to conditioned phenomena (i.e. to form,
feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness), and only
focuses on Nibbāna (has Nibbāna as the object of awareness).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>The many lesser, mundane levels of liberation are included in the term
<em>cetovimutti</em> when this term occurs on its own. Alternatively, the term
<em>sāmāyika-cetovimutti</em> (equivalent to <em>sāmāyika-vimutti</em> and
<em>samaya-vimutti</em>, all meaning ‘temporary liberation’) is used.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup> The
word <em>adhimutti</em> (’intent upon’; ‘absorbed in’) is often used to
describe these lesser levels of liberation, or else <em>adhimutti</em> is used
as a synonym for the above terms (see
Note <a href="#note-reflecting-nibbana">Reflecting on Nibbāna</a>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup> <em>Adhimutti</em> refers to being
absorbed in an object to the extent that one is freed from disturbances
and defilements for as long as one abides in that state, for example one
is freed from the hindrances (<em>nīvaraṇa</em>) when absorbed in jhāna.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Reflecting on Nibbāna</span><a id="note-reflecting-nibbana"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This definition of <em>vimutti</em> as equivalent to <em>adhimutti</em> can be used
in regard to Nibbāna, in the sense of ‘intent upon’ or ‘reflecting
upon’ Nibbāna, and can be used in reference to both unenlightened and
enlightened beings, even to arahants (e.g.: S. I. 154; D. III. 239-40;
A. III. 245; MA. I. 43; SA. I. 220; ItA. I. 166).</p>
<p>The Abhidhamma gives two definitions for <em>vimutti</em>: ‘concentrative
absorption’ (<em>cittassa adhimutti</em>) and Nibbāna (Dhs. 234). The
commentaries explain that concentrative absorption refers to the eight
<em>samāpatti</em>, since one is absorbed in the object of meditation and
free from harmful mental states (DhsA. 409).</p>
<p>At Nd. II. 41, the definition is broadened to include being intent
upon forms, sounds, smells, tastes, fame, happiness, robes, almsfood,
the Discipline, the suttas, the Abhidhamma, etc. (e.g.:
<em>rūpādhimutta</em>, <em>cīvarādhimutta</em>, <em>vinayādhimutta</em>). Compare the dual
description of <em>vimutti</em> at Ps. II. 145-6.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The standard definition for ‘temporary liberation’
(<em>sāmāyika-cetovimutti</em>) equates this liberation with the eight mundane
attainments (<em>samāpatti</em>): the four fine-material and the four
immaterial jhānas.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup> The concentrative attainments of unawakened
persons are confined to these eight. In order to specify that the
deliverance of mind here refers to the eight attainments, the word
<em>santa</em> (’peaceful’; ‘refined’) is occasionally added, as
<em>santa-cetovimutti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>‘Temporary liberation’ (<em>cetovimutti</em>, <em>sāmāyika-cetovimutti</em>,
<em>vimutti</em>, or <em>sāmāyika-vimutti</em>) can also have a very broad definition,
referring to absorption into any object of faith, inspiration, or
delight. This kind of liberation accompanies a mind that is intensely
focused on an object. This focus generates strength, courage and
perseverance. It is the incipient stage in a natural process
(<em>idappaccayatā</em> or <em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>) that leads on to joy,
tranquillity and concentration. {434} It is called liberation because it
is an escape from conflicting and bothersome mental qualities
(<em>paccanīka-dhamma</em> – ‘mental adversaries’), such as doubt,
discouragement, mental sluggishness, and fear. These mental qualities
are suppressed as long as the conditions supporting liberation are
maintained, as long as the mental strength generated by inspiration
remains. The texts even classify the aspiration to live in the
forest,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn30">30</a></sup> or the joy that arises when listening to a Dhamma
talk,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup> as this kind of liberation of mind. Aspects of this kind of
liberation, however, can also give rise to unwholesome mental
states.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>There are names for specific kinds of temporary liberation
(<em>sāmāyika-cetovimutti</em>), depending on the object on which the mind is
focused. The temporary liberation of mind that is most often mentioned
and encouraged is called ‘boundless liberation’ (<em>appamāṇā-cetovimutti</em>
or <em>appamaññā-cetovimutti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup> Here, one develops concentration by
radiating the qualities of lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>), compassion
(<em>karuṇā</em>), appreciative joy (<em>muditā</em>), and equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>) in
all directions with a mind that is unbounded and immeasurable, until the
mind is absorbed in these wholesome states and enters jhāna. The mind is
then freed from the five hindrances and from the unwholesome qualities
that are antagonistic to the four qualities listed above: the liberation
of lovingkindness (<em>mettā-cetovimutti</em>) is free from ill-will, the
liberation of compassion (<em>karuṇā-cetovimutti</em>) is free from hostility,
the liberation of appreciative joy (<em>muditā-cetovimutti</em>) is free from
jealousy, and the liberation of equanimity (<em>upekkhā-cetovimutti</em>) is
free from lust.</p>
<p>Other kinds of temporary liberation of mind, which occur in the
scriptures only rarely, include: <em>suññatā-cetovimutti</em> (liberation of
mind stemming from the insight that all conditioned phenomena are empty
of self and empty of anything related to self – <em>attaniya</em>);<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn34">34</a></sup>
<em>ākiñcaññā-cetovimutti</em> (the immaterial jhāna directed upon the sphere
of nothingness);<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn35">35</a></sup> and <em>mahaggatā-cetovimutti</em> (while in jhāna,
radiating the mind engaged with a <em>kasiṇa</em> meditation object over
however large an area or domain as one chooses).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn36">36</a></sup></p>
<p>Drawing upon the above material, it is fair to say that any devotion to
an ideal or object of faith, for example to a supreme deity, is a kind
of absorption and can be included in the broad definition of
<em>cetovimutti</em>.</p>
<p>Some people claim that abiding in jhāna is Nibbāna, or claim that
‘extinction of perception and feeling’ (<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em> or
<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>), the highest concentrative attainment, is Nibbāna.
{435} In fact, these concentrative attainments are used as instruments
to attain arahantship. They prepare the mind and make it suitable for
awakening. These attainments, along with their material and immaterial
properties, are conditioned phenomena, which are reflected upon by
Dhamma practitioners with insight and wisdom to give rise to true
knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>Arahants use these concentrative attainments for rest and to experience
happiness, and these attainments are thus called ‘abiding at ease in the
present’ (<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn38">38</a></sup> ‘divine abidings’
(<em>dibba-vihāra</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn39">39</a></sup> and ‘gradually ascending abidings’
(<em>anupubba-vihāra</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn40">40</a></sup> These states, however, are not Nibbāna. They
are means by which Nibbāna can be realized and they are easeful abidings
for those who have already realized Nibbāna. Indeed, the realization of
Nibbāna facilitates the attainment of these concentrative states and
allows a person to benefit greatly from them. For example, a person who
has attained the eight jhānas will have the necessary concentration and
wisdom to reach the attainment of cessation (<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>) when
they realize the state of non-returner or arahantship.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>A person who has not yet realized arahantship still has a degree of
attachment to fine-material and immaterial existence, and they may still
be fascinated or attached to concentrative attainments. {436} Although
jhānas are excellent, Buddhism considers attachment to jhāna a weakness.
Indeed, such attachment can be an obstacle for realizing Nibbāna. The
Buddha said that if a monk attains the highest immaterial jhāna
(<em>nevasaññānāsaññāyatana</em>) but indulges in the feeling of this state he
will not be able to realize Nibbāna, because there is still clinging
(<em>upādāna</em>). Clinging to such a refined state the Buddha called
‘superior clinging’ (<em>upādāna-seṭṭha</em>, see
Note <a href="#note-excellent-state">A State Considered Excellent</a>). Arahants make use of jhāna to dwell
at ease, but without any attachment.</p>
<p>Proof that jhānas, all the way up to attainment of cessation, are not
Nibbāna is the fact that arahants who are ‘those liberated by wisdom’
(<em>paññāvimutta</em>) have not attained the immaterial jhānas and are unable
to enter the attainment of cessation. From the Pali Canon we can deduce
that at the time of the Buddha there were more <em>paññāvimutta</em> than
<em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>. For example, at a large gathering of monks the
Buddha told Ven. Sāriputta:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Of these five hundred bhikkhus, Sāriputta, sixty bhikkhus are
triple-knowledge bearers (tevijja),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn42">42</a></sup> sixty bhikkhus are bearers of
the six direct knowledges (chaḷabhiñña), sixty bhikkhus are liberated
in both ways, while the rest [three hundred and twenty] are
liberated by wisdom.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 191.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">A State Considered Excellent</span><a id="note-excellent-state"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>M. II. 265. The commentaries explain <em>upādāna-seṭṭha</em> here as ‘a state
considered excellent’ (i.e. a higher realm in which to be reborn), but
the explanation above is consistent with the etymology and the context
(see MA. IV. 67).</p>
<p>The Buddha said if someone with exceptional qualities (for example he
is wealthy, famous, learned, a preacher of Dhamma, a follower of
ascetic practices, a forest dweller, a refuse-rag wearer, a tree-root
dweller, or an attainer of any of the eight jhānas) becomes arrogant
and looks down on others, then this person is an ‘inferior’ person
(Sappurisa Sutta, M. III. 37-45).</p>
<p>The teaching at A. II. 27-8 states that a bhikkhu in the noble lineage
is content with his robes, almsfood, and dwelling, and delights in
meditation, but does not use his virtues to praise himself or to
intimidate others.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Liberation by wisdom (<em>paññāvimutti</em>) is decisive and is equivalent to
attaining Nibbāna. This kind of liberation transforms liberation of mind
(<em>cetovimutti</em>), which may have been achieved long before and repeatedly
accessed in the past – or else it arises simultaneously with
<em>paññāvimutti</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn43">43</a></sup> – into unshakeable liberation of mind
(<em>akuppā-cetovimutti</em>), since the taints have now been eliminated.</p>
<p>Awakened persons derive the maximum benefit from <em>cetovimutti</em>, without
harming themselves or others. They do not indulge in these attainments
nor do they use the fruits of concentration – the mundane psychic
powers – in a misguided way for self-gratification. Here, liberation of
mind and liberation by wisdom exist as a pair, as is frequently
mentioned in the texts: <em>The deliverance of mind and deliverance by
wisdom wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without
remainder</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn44">44</a></sup> {437} The Buddha said that this unshakeable liberation
of mind (<em>cetovimutti</em> combined with <em>paññāvimutti</em>) is the essence and
goal of Buddhism:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>When he is diligent, he attains permanent liberation
(asamaya-vimutti). And it is impossible for that bhikkhu to fall away
from that permanent liberation.</p>
<p>So this holy life, brahman, does not have gain, honour, and fame for
its benefit, or the attainment of virtue for its benefit, or the
attainment of concentration for its benefit, or knowledge and vision
for its benefit. But it is this unshakeable deliverance of mind that
is the goal of this holy life, its heartwood, and its end.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn45">45</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. I. 197.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>There are three factors leading to the decline of temporary liberation
of mind (<em>samaya-cetovimutti</em>). First are the defilements (<em>kilesa</em>)
which have not yet been completely eliminated. They may have been
suppressed or subdued, but they lie in wait and are aroused when the
positive conditions like faith weaken. Second are the supportive
conditions like faith, enthusiasm, contentment and determination. When
these conditions fade or weaken, liberation of mind also declines. These
supportive conditions may even fade for good reason. A person may at one
time have strong faith in something and be greatly devoted, but later
realize that the faith is not grounded in wisdom and the object of faith
is unworthy of such devotion. Third are environmental factors, which
include a person’s health and external conditions like poverty or
famine. In spiritual practice these three factors are linked. For
example, due to some difficulty a person will lose heart; confusion,
irritation and discouragement will arise and liberation of mind will
vanish.</p>
<p>There are some interesting stories in the Pali Canon of how liberation
of mind can be affected. Ven. Godhika was diligent and resolute and he
reached temporary liberation of mind (<em>sāmāyika-cetovimutti</em>; the
mundane concentrative attainments). But due to the torment of chronic
illness he fell away from this liberation of mind. A second and a third
time he reached temporary liberation of mind and fell away from it. This
happened six times. {438} When he reached temporary liberation of mind a
seventh time, he thought that he would surely fall away from it as
before. He considered that it would be better to die while in this state
of liberation than die after falling away from it. He thus used a knife
to kill himself, but as he was lying on his bed in pain he established
mindfulness and reflected on the feelings (<em>vedanā</em>) arising. While
meditating in this way he achieved arahantship before attaining final
Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>Another passage describes the ascetics and brahmans who went into the
forest, living on fruits and berries, thinking that if they were to get
caught up in sensuality they would become intoxicated and fall under the
spell of Māra. When food was scarce and they became thin and weak, their
determination and enthusiasm slackened, and they returned to the wider
world to enjoy sense pleasures.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn47">47</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentaries sorted the many definitions of <em>vimutti</em> into five
groups, following the same model that they used for sorting the
definitions of ‘cessation’ (<em>nirodha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn48">48</a></sup> These five groups act as a
useful summary, as they contain the essence of all the definitions
presented so far:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn49">49</a></sup></p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <em>Vikkhambhana-vimutti</em>: liberation through the suppression of the
defilements. The suspension of the five hindrances through the power
of concentration. This refers to the eight ‘attainments’
(<em>samāpatti</em>): the four fine-material and the four immaterial
jhānas, and sometimes includes ‘access concentration’
(<em>upacāra-samādhi</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <em>Tadaṅga-vimutti</em>: liberation by way of specific qualities. To be
freed from unwholesome qualities by the substitution of opposite
qualities. Technically speaking, it is the freedom from wrong views
and attachments through the application of insight or knowledge. For
example, focusing on impermanence frees one from the belief in
permanence. It can also be used, however, in reference to general
matters of virtue and ethics. For example: a devotion to generosity
frees one from stinginess and greed; a commitment to lovingkindness
frees one from ill-will and negativity; and a dedication to
compassion and non-violence frees one from violence and cruelty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These first two kinds of liberation cover the meaning of ‘temporary
liberation’ (<em>sāmāyika-cetovimutti</em>) and are mundane. {439}</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <em>Samuccheda-vimutti</em>: the cutting off of the defilements; liberation
through final knowledge; <em>vimutti</em> as the ‘path’ (<em>magga</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <em>Paṭipassaddhi-vimutti</em>: the utter removal and stilling of
defilements; <em>vimutti</em> as the ‘fruit’ (<em>phala</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <em>Nissaraṇa-vimutti</em>: the state of deliverance; complete liberation
leading to supreme joy and unhindered engagement with the world;
<em>vimutti</em> as Nibbāna.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These final three kinds of liberation are defined as ‘permanent
liberation’ (<em>asāmāyika-cetovimutti</em>) and are transcendent. Essentially,
these five kinds of liberation are equivalent to <em>samatha</em>, <em>vipassanā</em>,
<em>magga</em>, <em>phala</em>, and Nibbāna, respectively.</p>

<p>{442} The following questions are often debated among Buddhist scholars
and practitioners:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can someone who only practises insight meditation (<em>vipassanā</em>)
attain arahantship, without practising tranquillity meditation
(<em>samatha</em>)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it necessary to attain jhāna before attaining Nibbāna?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To achieve the six kinds of ‘higher psychic attainments’
(<em>abhiññā</em>), is it sufficient to have attained the fourth jhāna or
must one have also attained the formless jhānas (i.e. the eight
<em>samāpatti</em>)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To attain the knowledge of the destruction of the taints
(<em>āsavakkhaya-ñāṇa</em>) and realize Nibbāna, must one have previously
attained the reminiscence of past lives (<em>pubbenivāsānussati-ñāṇa</em>)
and the knowledge of the decease and rebirth of beings
(<em>cutūpapāta-ñāṇa</em>)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While in jhāna can one practise insight and contemplate conditioned
phenomena or must one first emerge from jhāna?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it possible to develop <em>samatha</em> further and achieve

</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these questions involve key aspects of realizing Nibbāna, some
are only tangentially related, and some have already been discussed at
length, especially the question on whether a person can attain Nibbāna
by solely practising insight meditation. This section will focus on
those questions which are directly related to realization, drawing upon
evidence from the scriptures.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#general-aspects-of-realization" id="general-aspects-of-realization">General Aspects of Realization</a></h3>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>I declare, O monks, that the destruction of the taints occurs in
dependence on the first jhāna, or the second jhāna, or the third
jhāna, or the fourth jhāna; in dependence on the base of the infinity
of space, or the base of the infinity of consciousness, or the base of
nothingness, or the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, (or
in dependence on the cessation of perception and feeling).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn50">50</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Jhāna Sutta at A. IV. 422-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This sutta and three other suttas<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn51">51</a></sup> describe the way to use each
stage of concentrative attainment for reflection and to gain insight
into the true nature of conditioned phenomena. The above sutta
continues: {443}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>When it is said, ‘I declare, O monks, that the destruction of the
taints occurs in dependence on the first jhāna’, for what reason is
this said? Here ... a monk enters and dwells in the first jhāna....
Whatever states are included there comprised by form, feeling,
perception, volitional formations or consciousness: he views those
states as impermanent, as subject to stress ... as empty, as
nonself.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn52">52</a></sup> Having viewed them thus, his mind then turns away from
those states and focuses upon the deathless element: ‘This is
peaceful, this is sublime: that is ... Nibbāna.’ If he sustains (the
first jhāna),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn53">53</a></sup> he attains the destruction of the taints; but if he
does not attain the destruction of the taints because of delight in
the Dhamma, then ... he is due to be spontaneously reborn [in the
celestial realm Suddhāvāsā] and there attain final Nibbāna, without
ever returning from that world.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn54">54</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>From here the sutta describes a similar process of cultivating insight
to reach the destruction of the taints for each of the concentrative
levels all the way up to the sphere of nothingness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn55">55</a></sup></p>
<p>The Mahāmāluṅkya Sutta has less detail but describes the contemplation
of the three characteristics in reference to the five aggregates, in
each of the jhānas up to the sphere of nothingness, resulting in the
destruction of the taints. The Aṭṭhakanāgara and Dasama suttas have a
slight variation:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A monk enters and abides in the first jhāna.... He considers this and
understands it thus: ‘This first jhāna is conditioned and volitionally
produced. But whatever is conditioned and volitionally produced is
impermanent, subject to cessation.’ Sustaining that [first jhāna],
he attains the destruction of the taints.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In these suttas the liberations of mind through lovingkindness,
compassion, appreciative joy and equanimity are inserted between the
fine-material jhānas and the formless jhānas, adding four more
concentrative attainments for contemplation.</p>
<p>These four suttas contain essentially the same information; they differ
only in minor details. They describe the development of insight in
jhāna, from the first jhāna to the sphere of nothingness, ending in the
destruction of the taints. The Jhāna Sutta, however, adds a summary:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, monks, there is penetration to final knowledge (aññā-paṭivedha)
as far as meditative attainments accompanied by perception
(saññā-samāpatti) reach. {444}</p>
<p><em>A. IV. 426.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This means that in jhāna, from the sphere of nothingness and below,
there is perception (along with other accompanying aggregates), which
can be applied for contemplation and supports insight for the
realization of the destruction of the taints. In the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception (<em>nevasaññānāsaññāyatana</em>),
perception is too refined and cannot be applied for contemplation. This
holds even more true in the extinction of perception and feeling
(<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>). Therefore these two attainments are not
‘attainments accompanied by perception’ (<em>saññā-samāpatti</em>).</p>
<p>If this is so, how is it possible to attain the destruction of the
taints while in the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and
in the extinction of perception and feeling? The answer is that one must
first exit these highest levels of concentrative attainment and then
apply wisdom to contemplate conditioned phenomena and reach the
destruction of the taints. The Anupada Sutta contains a passage
concerning the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Again, monks, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness,
Sāriputta entered upon and abided in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He emerged mindful from that
attainment. Having done so, he contemplated the past states, which had
ceased and changed, thus: ‘So indeed, these states, not having been,
come into being; having been, they vanish.’</p>
<p><em>M. III. 28.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Compare this with the description of contemplating conditioned phenomena
while in the sphere of nothingness (and while in lower jhānas), in which
there is no mention of exiting the absorption. For example, in the above
sutta it says:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Again, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ Sāriputta entered upon
and abided in the base of nothingness. And the states in the base of
nothingness – the perception of the base of nothingness and the
unification of mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and
consciousness; the zeal, determination, energy, mindfulness,
equanimity, and attention – these states were known to him one by one
as they occurred; known to him those states arose, known they were
present, known they disappeared. He understood thus: ‘So indeed, these
states, not having been, come into being; having been, they vanish.’</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Cūḷaniddesa, a secondary text, explains the contemplation of the
sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in a similar way to the
Majjhima-Nikāya above:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>He entered upon and abided in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Having emerged from that
attainment, he regarded, examined, reflected on, and investigated the
mind and the mental constituents arising in that attainment as
impermanent ... subject to stress ... not-self ... not free.</p>
<p><em>Nd. II. 23.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>An examination of the original text (Sn. 205-6), however, reveals that
the phrase ‘base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception’ here is an
error. It should read ‘sphere of nothingness’, as confirmed by the
commentaries (NdA. 30; SnA. II. 593).</p>
<p>The secondary and later texts ordinarily describe the contemplation of
conditioned phenomena and the development of insight after emerging from
concentrative attainments, irrespective of how high or low these
attainments are.</p>
<p>Similar explanations are given in reference to the extinction of
perception and feeling (<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>): having emerged from
this attainment, a person contemplates the fine-material qualities of
this state, contemplates the qualities in the preceding state of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, or contemplates all conditioned
phenomena, to understand the truth and reach the destruction of the
taints.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>In a similar fashion, one can contemplate conditioned phenomena or the
mental constituents of jhāna after emerging from each of the jhānas,
from the sphere of nothingness down to the first jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn57">57</a></sup> The
passages above are provided, however, to prove that it is also possible
to develop insight while abiding in these states of jhāna, without first
emerging from them. Only with the two highest concentrative attainments
– of neither-perception-nor-non-perception and the extinction of
perception and feeling – must one first exit in order to develop
insight.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn58">58</a></sup> {445}</p>
<p>The commentaries refer to one who practises in this way as ‘one who uses
tranquillity as a vehicle’ (<em>samatha-yānika</em>): such a practitioner
practises tranquillity until reaching jhāna, at which point he or she
develops insight. This is the first way of practice in a group of four,
which is mentioned in the scriptures:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The practice of insight preceded by tranquillity<br />
(<em>samathapubbaṅgama-vipassanābhāvanā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The practice of tranquillity preceded by insight<br />
(<em>vipassanāpubbaṅgama-samathabhāvanā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The practice of tranquillity and insight in association<br />
(<em>yuganaddhasamatha-vipassanābhāvanā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way of practice when the mind is distorted or misled by an
excitement or agitation in regard to the Dhamma<br />
(<em>dhammuddhaccaviggahita-mānasa</em>).</p>
<p>Here one has the misapprehension that the intermediate results of
one’s practice constitute path, fruit, and Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn59">59</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These four ways of practice are a summary of the four pathways (<em>magga</em>)
described by Ven. Ānanda:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Friends, whatever bhikkhu or bhikkhunī has declared the attainment of
arahantship in my presence has done so by these four paths or by a
certain one among them. What four?</p>
<p>Here, friends, a monk develops insight preceded by tranquillity. While
he develops insight preceded by tranquillity, the path arises in him.
He now pursues, develops and cultivates that path, and while he is
doing so the fetters are abandoned and the underlying tendencies are
uprooted.</p>
<p>Again, friends, a monk develops tranquillity preceded by insight.
While he develops tranquillity preceded by insight, the path arises in
him. He now pursues, develops and cultivates that path ... and the
underlying tendencies are uprooted.</p>
<p>Again, friends, a monk develops tranquillity and insight in tandem.
While he thus develops tranquillity and insight in tandem, the path
arises in him. He now pursues, develops and cultivates that path ...
and the underlying tendencies are uprooted.</p>
<p>Or again, friends, a monk’s mind is seized by agitation caused by
higher states of mind. But there comes a time when his mind becomes
internally steady, composed, unified, and concentrated. Then the path
arises in him. He now pursues, develops and cultivates that path ...
and the underlying tendencies are uprooted.</p>
<p><em>A. II. 157-8; Ps. II. 92; referred to at VismṬ.:

</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Insight preceded by tranquillity</strong>: the Paṭisambhidāmagga defines this
thus: initially, the mind is one-pointed, steady and concentrated.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn60">60</a></sup>
{446} This concentration can arise from any of these causes: the power
of renunciation (<em>nekkhamma</em>); the power of a freedom from ill-will
(<em>abyāpāda</em>); the perception of light (<em>āloka-saññā</em>), which combats
drowsiness; an absence of restlessness (<em>avikkhepa</em>); reflection on
aspects of Dhamma (<em>dhamma-vavatthāna</em>), which dispels doubt; knowledge
(<em>ñāṇa</em>); joy (<em>pāmojja</em>);<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn61">61</a></sup> the first jhāna; the second jhāna; the
third jhāna; the fourth jhāna; the sphere of infinity of space
(<em>ākāsānañcāyatana</em>); the sphere of infinity of consciousness
(<em>viññāṇañcāyatana</em>); the sphere of nothingness; the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception; the ten <em>kasiṇa</em> meditations;
meditation on the ten reflections (<em>anussati</em>); meditation on the ten
stages of decay (<em>asubha</em>); and meditation on the thirty-two aspects of
mindfulness of breathing.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn62">62</a></sup> Concentration is followed by wisdom,
which discerns all the attributes of the different stages of
concentration as impermanent, subject to stress (<em>dukkha</em>), and nonself.</p>
<p>The commentaries present a simpler explanation for this first way of
practice: a person first develops concentration (either access
concentration or attainment concentration). He then reflects on that
level of concentration, along with accompanying mental factors, as
impermanent, etc., until there is noble path-attainment
(<em>ariya-magga</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn63">63</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Tranquillity preceded by insight</strong>: the Paṭisambhidāmagga
explains:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn64">64</a></sup> initially, a person uses insight to see things as
impermanent, subject to stress, and nonself. Then, he ‘lets go’ of all
the qualities manifest during insight meditation, and this ‘letting go’
becomes the new object of meditation. The mind then becomes one-pointed
and concentrated.</p>
<p>The commentaries elaborate: a person has not yet generated tranquillity,
but he or she discerns the universal characteristics (impermanence,
etc.) in the five aggregates of clinging (<em>upādāna-khandha</em>). When
insight (<em>vipassanā</em>) is complete, ‘letting go’ of all factors of
insight becomes the object of meditation and the mind becomes
one-pointed and concentrated. This leads to path attainment. (See
Note <a href="#note-tranquillity-or-insight">Tranquillity or Insight</a>) {447}</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Tranquillity or Insight</span><a id="note-tranquillity-or-insight"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>See: MA. I. 108; NdA. II. 313; AA. III. 143; ItA. I. 54. A. II. 92-4
mentions those who have tranquillity but no insight and those who have
insight but no tranquillity. These attainments are called
<em>ceto-samatha</em> and <em>adhipaññādhamma-vipassanā</em>, respectively.</p>
<p>AA. III. 116 explains these as:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>attainment concentration (<em>appanā-samādhi</em>), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>insight contemplating conditioned phenomena.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This passage from the Aṅguttara Nikāya reveals that gaining insight
does not inevitably give rise to tranquillity, or as the commentaries
say: although one gains insight, one may not reach the desired level
of concentration, i.e. jhāna. One is encouraged in this case to make
more effort practising <em>samatha</em>.</p>
<p>This passage also reveals the encouragement to practise tranquillity
and insight as a pair, in order to eliminate the taints at a later
stage. Cf.: A. V. 99; A. IV. 360-1; the identical passage occurs at:
Pug. 7-8, 61-2. The Abhidhamma gives a lofty definition of these
terms, explaining <em>ceto-samatha</em> as the fine-material and immaterial
attainments, and <em>adhipaññādhamma-vipassanā</em> as path and fruit (PañcA.
244). From this explanation, one who attains tranquillity but not
insight is an unenlightened person who has attained the eight jhānas,
while someone who attains insight but not tranquillity is a noble
disciple who is a pure-insight practitioner. Someone who has attained
neither is an ordinary, unawakened person.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The commentaries say that whichever of these two ways of practice a
person follows (tranquillity preceded by insight or insight preceded by
tranquillity), tranquillity and insight must always arise side by side
at the moment of noble path attainment.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn65">65</a></sup> This is so because
<em>samatha</em> and <em>vipassanā</em> are essentially equivalent to the eight
factors of the Noble Path: <em>vipassanā</em> equals right view
(<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>) and right intention (<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>), and <em>samatha</em>
comprises all the remaining six factors. These eight factors arise
naturally together at the moment of attaining the ‘noble realm’
(<em>ariya-bhūmi</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-path-knowledge">Path Knowledge</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Path Knowledge</span><a id="note-path-knowledge"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Samatha</em>, <em>vipassanā</em> and the factors of the Path, see: PsA. I. 195;
VbhA. 120; VismṬ.: Indriyasaccaniddesavaṇṇanā,
Ekavidhādivinicchayakathāvaṇṇanā.</p>
<p>The eight factors of the Path arising simultaneously at the moment of
‘path-knowledge’ (<em>magga-ñāṇa</em>), see: PsA. I. 195; VbhA. 120; Vism.
680; MA. II. 363.</p>
<p>In fact, the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment
(<em>bodhipakkhiya-dhamma</em>) arise simultaneously in the mind at the
moment of ‘path-knowledge’. Note that this interpretation of the
factors of the path or of enlightenment arising simultaneously comes
from the Abhidhamma, which states that the thirty-seven factors are
mental constituents (<em>cetasika</em>) arising in a single mind moment. The
number of path factors or enlightenment factors present at the moment
of ‘path-knowledge’ can also be reduced, depending on the kind of
knowledge accompanying that particular stage of the path (see: PsA. I.
193; DhsA. 228; Vism. 666-7; DA. III. 804; CompṬ.:
Cittaparicchedavaṇṇanā, Vitthāragaṇanavaṇṇanā).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>Tranquillity and insight in tandem</strong>: the Paṭisambhidāmagga
explains:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn66">66</a></sup> a person develops tranquillity and insight in tandem, in
sixteen ways. One of these ways is that the practice of <em>samatha</em> and
the practice of <em>vipassanā</em> lead to an identical object of meditation
(<em>ārammaṇa</em>). For example, when one abandons restlessness (<em>uddhacca</em>),
the mind becomes concentrated and ‘cessation’ (<em>nirodha</em>) becomes the
object of awareness. (At the same time), by abandoning ignorance,
insight arises and ‘cessation’ becomes the object of awareness. In this
way, tranquillity and insight work together on an equal basis.</p>
<p>Some commentarial passages claim that although there is cooperation
between tranquillity and insight, this does not mean that <em>samatha</em> and
<em>vipassanā</em> arise simultaneously, since it is not possible to
contemplate conditioned phenomena while the mind is one-pointed in
jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn67">67</a></sup> These passages state that these two ways of meditation act
as a pair in so far that insight follows on from a person’s level of
concentrative attainment, and equally the next level of concentrative
attainment relies on one’s previous level of insight. A person enters
first jhāna, exits first jhāna, contemplates the conditioned nature of
first jhāna, enters second jhāna, exits second jhāna, contemplates the
conditioned nature of second jhāna, enters third jhāna, etc., until he
exits from and contemplates the conditioned nature of the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn68">68</a></sup> An important example of this
explanation is the account of Ven. Sāriputta, who developed tranquillity
and insight in tandem, from the first jhāna to the attainment of path
and fruit (of arahantship).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn69">69</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>The way of practice when the mind is misled by higher states of
mind</strong>: the Paṭisambhidāmagga explains:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn70">70</a></sup> when a person reflects on
the three characteristics in reference to the five aggregates, the
following mind states may arise: radiance (<em>obhāsa</em>), knowledge
(<em>ñāṇa</em>), bliss (<em>pīti</em>), serenity (<em>passaddhi</em>), joy (<em>sukha</em>),
determination (<em>adhimokkha</em>), balanced effort (<em>paggāha</em>), careful
attention (<em>upaṭṭhāna</em>), equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>), and devotion
(<em>nikanti</em>). The practitioner here believes that the radiance, for
example, is a higher state of mind: he believes he has attained path,
fruit or Nibbāna. {448} Thinking in this way causes restlessness and
these ten states of mind are not seen as they really are, as
impermanent, subject to stress, and not-self. Wise discernment of these
ten mind states causing the mind to waver leads to a settled, clear and
concentrated mind. With this wisdom, one is not carried away by these
mind states. The heart will be pure and still and one’s meditation will
neither be misguided nor impaired. The path can subsequently arise.</p>
<p>The commentaries refer to these higher states of mind as the ten
‘impurities of insight’ (<em>vipassanūpakilesa</em>, see
Note <a href="#note-impurities">The Ten Impurities of Insight</a>), which arise in people whose insight
practice is still weak (<em>taruṇa-vipassanā</em>). Because these qualities are
exceptional and have not been experienced before, practitioners are
likely to believe they have attained path and fruit. This
misunderstanding leads them to deviate from the way of insight; they
abandon their meditation practice while delighting in these states of
mind. The correct way of practice is to recognize the true nature of
these mental states when they arise: that they are impermanent,
conditioned, dependently arisen (<em>paṭicca-samuppanna</em>), and subject to
decline. They do not belong to us; they are not who we are (’I am not
this; this is not mine’). By not being overly excited by these mental
states, attachment to them wanes. A person is then able to practise
correctly until reaching path and fruit.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn71">71</a></sup></p>

<p>According to the commentaries, there are two principal ways of practice:
insight preceded by tranquillity and tranquillity preceded by insight.
The remaining two ways of practice are simply extensions of these former
two. The third way of practise, of tranquillity and insight in tandem,
is a subdivision of the first way of practice. The fourth way of
practice is applied in special circumstances, when specific problems
arise by practising the first three ways. It is a strategy for solving
these problems arising in practice. {449}</p>
<p>These two principal ways of practice are probably the origin of the two
meditation techniques enumerated in the commentaries: the ‘vehicle of
tranquillity’ (<em>samatha-yāna</em>) of the <em>samatha-yānika</em> (’one who uses
tranquillity as a vehicle’) and the ‘vehicle of insight’
(<em>vipassanā-yāna</em>) of the <em>vipassanā-yānika</em> (’one who uses insight as a
vehicle’). The <em>samatha-yānika</em> practises tranquillity first and insight
later. Generally speaking, this tranquillity can simply be ‘access
concentration’ (<em>upacāra-samādhi</em>) or it can refer to ‘attainment
concentration’ (<em>appanā-samādhi</em>) of the jhānas.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn72">72</a></sup> The commentaries
prefer the more restricted meaning, for someone who has attained the
jhānas.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn73">73</a></sup> They claim that the way of practice described by the
Buddha, quoted at the beginning of this section (i.e. that the
destruction of the taints occurs in dependence on the first jhāna,
etc.), belongs to the <em>samatha-yānika</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>vipassanā-yānika</em> is also called a <em>suddhavipassanā-yānika</em> – ‘one
who practises pure insight as a vehicle’. This refers to those who
develop insight without having previously developed concentration. When
they have correctly contemplated the true nature of things, the mind
becomes peaceful and concentration arises automatically. At first, the
concentration may be ‘momentary’ (<em>khaṇika-samādhi</em>), which is the
lowest level of concentration required for subsequent insight practice,
as confirmed by this passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Without momentary concentration, insight cannot function.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn74">74</a></sup></p>
<p><em>VismṬ.: Paṭhamo Bhāgo, Nidānādikathāvaṇṇanā</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Someone who begins with temporary concentration and then practises
insight is also classified as a <em>vipassanā-yānika</em>, because most
everyone experiences temporary concentration when the mind is settled in
an activity or due to a conducive environment. As concentration becomes
naturally stronger through insight practice, it may develop into ‘access
concentration’ (<em>upacāra-samādhi</em>): concentration on the verge of jhāna.
(See
Note <a href="#note-insight-without-jhana">Insight Without Jhāna</a>) Finally, at the moment of
realizing path and fruit, concentration is well-established as
‘attainment concentration’ (See
Note <a href="#note-kinds-concentration">Kinds of Concentration</a>), and one reaches at least the
first jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn75">75</a></sup> This accords with the principle mentioned earlier,
that a person realizing the ‘noble realm’ must be accomplished in both
tranquillity and insight. {450}</p>
<p>When those who use tranquillity as a vehicle attain arahantship, they
are divided into two kinds: those liberated by wisdom (<em>paññā-vimutta</em>)
and those liberated both ways (<em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>). The former are
those who have attained jhāna not higher than the fourth jhāna. The
latter are those who have attained a formless jhāna or higher, up to the
extinction of perception and feeling. Those who use insight as a vehicle
and who attain arahantship are all classified as <em>paññā-vimutta</em>, and
the commentaries assign a special name for them: <em>sukkha-vipassaka</em>
(’dry insight practitioners’, see
Note <a href="#note-dry-insight">Dry Insight Practitioners</a>). The commentaries divide the arahants
into ten kinds, listed from the highest to the lowest:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn76">76</a></sup></p>

<p>Passages in the Tipiṭaka describing particular ways of practice use
rather fixed terminology, even though these passages appear in different
locations. There are two main outlines for the way of practice in which
tranquillity precedes insight, and they both involve reaching a superior
level of concentration before developing insight. This can be called the
supreme way of practice. The following examples of these two main
outlines are drawn from passages recording the Buddha’s awakening:</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#outline-1" id="outline-1">Outline #1</a></h3>
<p>This common description describes the four jhānas followed by the
threefold knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>So too, Aggivessana, [when I had eaten solid food and regained my
strength], quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, I entered upon and abided in the first jhāna ...
the second jhāna ... the third jhāna ... the fourth jhāna.</p>
<p>When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid
of imperfection (upakkilesa), malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained
to imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the recollection of
past lives.... [This was the first true knowledge attained by me in
the first watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true
knowledge arose, darkness was banished and light arose.]</p>
<p>When my concentrated mind was thus purified ... I directed it to
knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings.... [This
was the second true knowledge attained by me in the second watch of
the night. Ignorance was banished ... light arose.]</p>
<p>When my concentrated mind was thus purified ... I directed it to
knowledge of the destruction of the taints. I directly knew as it
actually is: ‘This is suffering’, ‘this is the origin of suffering’,
‘this is the cessation of suffering’, ‘this is the way leading to the
cessation of suffering’.... ‘These are the taints’, ‘this is the
origin of the taints’, ‘this is the cessation of the taints’, ‘this is
the way leading to the cessation of the taints’.</p>
<p>When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of
sensual desire, from the taint of becoming, and from the taint of
ignorance. When it was liberated there came the knowledge: ‘It is
liberated.’ I directly knew: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has
been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming
to any state of being.’</p>
<p>[This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the third watch
of the night. Ignorance was banished ... light arose.]<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn77">77</a></sup></p>

<p>When this description is used to describe the practice of realization
for disciples of the Buddha, the terminology is usually the same except
for the passages in brackets.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn78">78</a></sup> {452} Some passages describe
directing the mind to the eight kinds of knowledge rather than just the
three mentioned above,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn79">79</a></sup> while other passages only mention directing
the mind to the final knowledge, of destruction of the taints.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn80">80</a></sup></p>

<p>A less common description describes the eight concentrative attainments
(<em>samāpatti</em>) in addition to the ‘attainment of cessation’
(<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>), followed by the knowledge of the destruction of
the taints:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>So too, Ānanda, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna ... but
as I was dwelling in this state, mental application accompanied by
perception (saññā-manasikāra) associated with sensuality disturbed my
mind, which was for me an impediment (ābādha). Then it occurred to me:
‘With the subsiding of applied and sustained thought, let me enter and
dwell in the second jhāna.’</p>
<p>Then [on a later occasion] I entered and dwelled in the second jhāna
... but as I dwelled in this state, mental application accompanied by
perception associated with applied thought disturbed my mind, which
was for me an impediment. Then it occurred to me: ... ‘Let me enter
and dwell in the third jhāna.’</p>
<p>Then [on a later occasion] I entered and dwelled in the third jhāna
... but as I dwelled in this state, mental application accompanied by
perception associated with rapture disturbed my mind, which was for me
an impediment. Then it occurred to me: ... ‘Let me enter and dwell in
the fourth jhāna.’</p>
<p>Then [on a later occasion] I entered and dwelled in the fourth jhāna
... but as I dwelled in this state, mental application accompanied by
perception associated with equanimity disturbed my mind, which was for
me an impediment. Then it occurred to me: ‘With the complete
surmounting of perceptions of form ... let me enter and dwell in the
base of infinite space.’</p>
<p>Then [on a later occasion] I entered and dwelled in the base of
infinite space ... but as I dwelled in this state, mental application
accompanied by perception associated with physical form disturbed my
mind, which was for me an impediment. Then it occurred to me: ‘With
the complete surmounting of the base of infinite space ... let me
enter and dwell in the base of infinite consciousness.’</p>
<p>Then [on a later occasion] I entered and dwelled in the base of
infinite consciousness ... but as I dwelled in this state, mental
application accompanied by perception associated with the base of
infinite space disturbed my mind, which was for me an impediment. Then
it occurred to me: ‘By completely surmounting the base of infinite
consciousness ... let me enter and dwell in the base of nothingness.’</p>
<p>Then [on a later occasion] I entered and dwelled in the base of
nothingness ... but as I dwelled in this state, mental application
accompanied by perception associated with the base of infinite
consciousness disturbed my mind, which was for me an impediment. Then
it occurred to me: ‘By completely surmounting the base of nothingness
... let me enter and dwell in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception.’ {453}</p>
<p>Then [on a later occasion] I entered and dwelled in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception ... but as I dwelled in this
state, mental application accompanied by perception associated with
the base of nothingness disturbed my mind, which was for me an
impediment. Then it occurred to me: ‘By completely surmounting the
base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception ... let me attain the
extinction of perception and feeling.’</p>
<p>Then [on a later occasion] having seen the danger in the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception ... I attained the extinction of
perception and feeling, and by seeing with wisdom the taints were
completely destroyed.</p>
<p>So long, Ānanda, as I did not attain and emerge from these nine
gradual abidings, in both direct and reverse order, I did not claim to
have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world
with its devas, Māra and Brahma, in this generation with its ascetics
and brahmans, its devas and humans. But when I attained and emerged
from these nine gradual abidings, in both direct and reverse order,
then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect
enlightenment in this world with its ... devas and humans.</p>
<p>The knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘Unshakeable is my liberation of
mind; this is my last birth; now there is no more renewed existence.’</p>
<p><em>A. IV. 439-48.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When this second outline of the gradual path to enlightenment is used in
a general sense for disciples, it follows the same terminology but
without the detailed analysis:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>When that monk abandons these five hindrances ... quite secluded from
sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon
and abides in the first jhāna ... second jhāna ... third jhāna ...
fourth jhāna ... the base of infinite space ... the base of infinite
consciousness ... the base of nothingness ... the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception ... enters and abides in the
extinction of perception and feeling. And having seen with wisdom, his
taints are utterly destroyed.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn81">81</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. IV. 437-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The reason for selecting two passages describing the Buddha’s
enlightenment as examples for the two outlines of practice is to show
how these two ways of practice are essentially the same, despite
appearing different. They both describe the enlightenment of a single
Buddha, and this enlightenment occurred only once.</p>
<p>Scholars may be confused by or misunderstand these two outlines of
practice, by interpreting each description too literally and overlooking
evidence from other sources that reveal their compatibility. There are
five main misunderstandings about these two outlines of practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The belief that it is necessary to attain the first two kinds of
knowledge (recollection of past lives and the knowledge of the
passing away and rebirth of beings) before one is able to reach
awakening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The belief that the fourth fine-material jhāna is an adequate basis
for reaching the threefold knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>) and the six kinds of
‘higher psychic attainments’ (<em>abhiññā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The belief that it is possible to reach enlightenment while abiding
in the extinction of perception and feeling. {454}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The belief that these two outlines indicate two distinct ways of
practice to awakening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The belief that the gradual attainments described in these outlines
occur in a single period of time.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn82">82</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us look more closely at these misunderstandings:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Evidence that it is not necessary to attain the recollection of
past lives or the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings in
order to attain arahantship or realize Nibbāna is clear:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In some examples of the first outline there is no mention of the
first two kinds of knowledge: a person attains the fourth jhāna and
directs the concentrated mind directly to the destruction of the
taints.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn83">83</a></sup> These examples show that the two former kinds of
knowledge are optional.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Susīma Sutta, the Buddha describes arahants liberated by
wisdom (<em>paññāvimutta</em>), who are not attached to the five aggregates
and discern Dependent Origination, and yet are unable to perform
psychic powers: they do not have the divine ear, telepathy,
recollection of past lives, the divine eye (<em>cutūpapāta-ñāṇa</em>), nor
do they dwell in ‘peaceful deliverances’ (<em>santa-vimokkha</em> =
formless attainments). They only possess the knowledge of the
destruction of the taints; they do not possess the five mundane
kinds of ‘supreme knowledge’ (<em>abhiññā</em>) nor have they accessed the
formless jhānas.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn84">84</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attainment of the six <em>abhiññā</em> (including the three <em>vijjā</em>)
depends on a certain degree of refined concentration. With
sufficient concentration a person is able to direct the mind to
generate a desired kind of <em>abhiññā</em>; it is not necessary to attain
one kind of ‘supreme knowledge’ before attaining another:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>That concentration has attained to full tranquillity and achieved
mental unification.... Then, to whatever mental state realizable by
direct knowledge (abhiññāsacchikaraṇīya-dhamma) he directs his mind,
he achieves the capacity of realizing that state by direct knowledge,
whenever the necessary conditions obtain.</p>
<p>If he wishes: ‘May I wield the various kinds of psychic power... may I
hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human ... may I
understand the minds of other beings ... may I recollect my manifold
past lives ... may I see beings passing away and being reborn ... may
I in this very life enter and dwell in the taintless liberation of
mind ... he achieves the capacity of realizing that state by direct
knowledge, whenever the necessary conditions obtain. {455}</p>
<p><em>A. I. 254; A. III. 16-7, 25, 82-3; A. IV. 421; M. III. 97.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The required level of concentration to reach these attainments is as
follows:</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> The concentration (<em>samādhi</em>) of the fourth jhāna is the highest
form of concentration. Even the concentration of the formless jhānas is
classified as the concentration of the fourth jhāna,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn85">85</a></sup> since the
mental factors of the formless jhānas consist of the same two factors of
the fourth jhāna: equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>) and one-pointedness
(<em>ekaggatā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn86">86</a></sup> The concentration of the fourth jhāna is universally
applicable: it can be used, for example, as a basis for insight, for
‘supreme knowledge’ (<em>abhiññā</em>), or for the ‘attainment of
extinction’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn87">87</a></sup> There is, however, a special clause: the concentration
of the formless jhānas is more refined and further from adverse
conditions (<em>paccanīka-dhamma</em>) than the concentration of the fourth
jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn88">88</a></sup> Even the different formless jhānas become progressively more
refined.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn89">89</a></sup> It is for this reason that those who attain arahantship
after attaining the fourth jhāna are classified as ‘liberated by wisdom’
(<em>paññāvimutta</em>), not as ‘liberated in both ways’
(<em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>). To be classified as ‘liberated in both ways’
one must have previously attained one of the formless jhānas.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn90">90</a></sup>
Therefore, there is a proviso to the commentarial statement that the
fourth jhāna is used as a basis for other attainments: in some cases the
concentration of ordinary fourth jhāna is used, while in other cases the
more refined concentration of fourth jhāna (of the formless jhānas) is
required.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, literally speaking, persons ‘liberated by wisdom’
(<em>paññā-vimutta</em>) have only attained the knowledge of the destruction of
the taints; they have not attained other forms of knowledge (<em>vijjā</em> or
<em>abhiññā</em>), nor have they attained the formless jhānas. Attainment of
the three <em>vijjā</em> or the six <em>abhiññā</em> is the domain of ‘one liberated
in both ways’ (<em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>), who has also attained formless
jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn91">91</a></sup> This is the standard definition as found in the Pali Canon.</p>
<p>The commentaries offer a more elaborate definition, which can be
summarized as follows: at first, a person practises tranquillity
meditation until attaining the fourth jhāna; this is followed by the
attainments of all eight jhānas. These attainments, however, must be a
result of practising the eight <em>kasiṇa</em> meditations (excluding the
meditations on light and space).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn92">92</a></sup> Having gained fluency in the eight
attainments, the mind becomes receptive.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn93">93</a></sup> At this point a person
only needs to enter the fourth jhāna, and then directs the mind to
generate or apply one of the <em>abhiññā</em>, according to his wishes.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn94">94</a></sup>
{456} As preparation a person must access the eight attainments, but at
the time of achieving a ‘supreme attainment’ (<em>abhiññā</em>), accessing the
fourth jhāna is sufficient. Due to the previous cultivation of the eight
jhānas, a person’s concentration in this case will be more refined than
the concentration of someone who has never attained a level higher than
the fourth jhāna.</p>
<p>From the angle of this commentarial explanation, one can say that the
fourth jhāna is a basis for ‘supreme knowledge’ (<em>abhiññā</em>). This
conforms to the statement that the mind possessing eight factors, by
developing the concentration of the fourth jhāna to the degree of the
formless attainments, is ‘suitable for application’; it is a basis, or
‘proximate cause’ (<em>padaṭṭhāna</em>), for realizing any state that may be
realized by direct knowledge.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn95">95</a></sup> Exceptions to this rule are those who
have a strong ‘previous connection’ (<em>pubba-yoga</em>): those who have made
effort and accumulated virtue in the past, for instance the Buddha, the
‘silent’ Buddhas (<em>pacceka-buddha</em>) and the chief disciples. They need
not follow this procedure and become proficient in the formless jhānas;
they simply need to be skilled in the fourth jhāna to achieve
<em>abhiññā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn96">96</a></sup></p>
<p>The two passages above describing the Buddha’s awakening are compatible
with this interpretation, even if they do not mention a ‘previous
connection’. In the first passage the Buddha accesses the fourth jhāna
and then directs the mind to realize the three <em>vijjā</em>. Earlier in his
life he had established a strong foundation in <em>samatha</em> and attained
the eight jhānas while living with the teachers Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka
Rāmaputta.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn97">97</a></sup> The second passage reveals that the Buddha developed
proficiency in all levels of concentrative absorptions before his
enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Passages describing the extinction of perception and feeling
(<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>) can easily lead inexperienced readers to the
false conclusion that a person who has attained this state reaches
arahantship while abiding in this attainment:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>By completely surmounting the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception he enters and abides in the
extinction of perception and feeling; and having seen with wisdom, his
taints are completely destroyed.</p>
<p><em>A. IV. 437-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This passage lists the sequence of practice and realization but does not
include the circumstances or intermediate details. The reader should see
this as a list of stages, not as the description of a single event.
Compare it with a passage from the Pali Canon that provides more detail:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>By completely surmounting the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception a monk enters and abides in the
extinction of perception and feeling. When a monk both attains to and
emerges from that attainment, his mind becomes subtle and pliant; and
with his mind subtle and pliant, immeasurable concentration has been
well-developed by him. {457}</p>
<p>With this immeasurable concentration that is well-developed, he
directs his mind to whatever mental state is realizable by direct
knowledge, and he attains the ability to witness these states whenever
the necessary conditions obtain. If he wishes: ‘May I wield the
various kinds of psychic power ... may I hear both kinds of sounds,
the divine and the human ... may I in this very life enter and dwell
in the taintless liberation of mind ... he achieves the capacity of
realizing that state by direct knowledge, whenever the necessary
conditions obtain.</p>
<p><em>A. IV. 421; cf.: D. II. 71.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the second passage the ‘entering upon the extinction of perception
and feeling’ and the ‘destruction of the taints’ are separated. The
attainment of <em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em> is a supportive condition,
bestowing a suitable level of concentration to the mind. Afterwards, ‘by
seeing with wisdom’ a person dwells in the taintless liberation of mind.
These passages corroborate the fact that the two earlier outlines (for
the way of practice in which tranquillity precedes insight) have
essentially the same meaning.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> As can be seen from the previous three points addressing various
misunderstandings, the two main outlines describe a single way of
practice from different angles. The first outline emphasizes the
practice and highest realization that results from applying
well-developed concentration to accomplish ‘supreme knowledge’ and
insight. The second outline describes intermediary stages of
tranquillity meditation along with the true purpose of tranquillity: the
final stage of insight. In this sense, the previous three points have
already addressed the misunderstanding that the two formulas describe
two distinct ways of practice.</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Points two and three have already touched upon the subject of
time in reference to practice and realization. In the first outline, the
Buddha’s gradual attainment of the three <em>vijjā</em> occurs in the three
‘watches’ of a single night. But in the case of other practitioners, the
attainment of each <em>vijjā</em> or each <em>abhiññā</em> can happen either in quick
succession or separated by months or years.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn98">98</a></sup></p>
<p>The second outline describing the Buddha’s concentrative attainments
clearly indicates that a period of time elapses between each attainment.
Examples of the same outline describing the attainments of other
practitioners, however, do not mention time, which can give the
impression that these attainments occur during a single time period. In
fact, there is no uniform period of time that these attainments occur –
it will vary from person to person.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn99">99</a></sup> The two outlines merely
describe the different levels of attainment – they do not necessarily
define the time involved. {458}</p>
<p>There are passages in the scriptures that confirm this fact, for example
the story of Ven. Sāriputta in the Dīghanakha Sutta.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn100">100</a></sup> While the
Buddha was giving a discourse on feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) and other topics in
the Boar’s Cave on Mount Vulture Peak to the wanderer Dīghanakha,
Sāriputta was standing behind the Buddha, fanning him. Reflecting on
this Dhamma teaching, Sāriputta realized arahantship. This occurred
after Sāriputta had been ordained for two weeks. Looking at this sutta
in isolation, one may have the impression that Sāriputta had not reached
any attainments to add to his ‘opening of the eye of Dhamma’
(stream-entry) two weeks previous to this occasion; instead, at this
moment, he realized complete awakening (arahantship). But by reading the
Anupada Sutta one sees that during these two weeks Sāriputta was
developing insight in conjunction with jhānas
(<em>yuganaddha-samatha-vipassanā</em> – tranquillity and insight in unison)
without interruption, from the first jhāna to the extinction of
perception and feeling. This reveals that he had realized the fruit of
non-returning before listening to the Dīghanakha Sutta.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn101">101</a></sup></p>
<p>One last question that should be addressed is: can arahants develop
tranquillity meditation and increase concentrative attainments or
psychic powers after being enlightened? Those who use insight as a
vehicle (<em>vipassanā-yānika</em>) have not previously attained jhāna, but at
the moment of path-realization concentration becomes firm and they
access the first jhāna. Afterwards, they can access the first jhāna
(’fruit of attainment’ – <em>phala-samāpatti</em>) in order ‘to abide in
happiness in the present’, whenever they wish. The question here is
whether they can develop higher levels of jhāna. The sub-commentaries
claim they can. Their state of mind is conducive to refining and
strengthening concentration. They probably develop <em>samatha</em> to promote
a ‘happy abiding in the present’ (<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-abiding">Abiding</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Abiding</span><a id="note-abiding"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>CompṬ.: Vīthimuttaparicchedavaṇṇanā, Kammacatukkavaṇṇanā mentions a
non-returner who was a bare-insight practitioner (<em>sukkha-vipassaka</em>),
and who generated a concentrative attainment at the moment of death so
as to be able to take birth in the ‘Pure Abodes’ (<em>suddhāvāsa</em>).</p>
<p>DA. III. 1007 defines ‘concentrative meditation for a happy abiding in
the present’ (at D. III. 222-3) as both the ‘fruit of jhāna
attainment’ (<em>phalasamāpatti-jhāna</em>) and the jhānas that arahants
subsequently develop.</p>
<p>PañcA. 107 describes arahants who access consecutive levels of
concentrative attainment unattained by them before.</p>
<p>A. I. 242-3 describes how at the moment of the ‘opening of the eye of
Dhamma’ the noble disciple abandons the first three fetters (realizes
stream-entry). Later, ‘the eye of Dhamma’ occurs again and both greed
and ill-will are abandoned (realization of non-returning). This
disciple then enters the first jhāna. If he dies at such a time no
fetters exist that would lead him back to this world. From one angle
it appears in this sutta that the disciple attained first jhāna after
realizing non-returning, but from our earlier explanations one must
interpret this as accessing a jhāna previously attained.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The same most likely holds true in regard to supernormal powers
(<em>abhiññā</em>). For two reasons, however, arahants do not spend a lot of
effort trying to attain new powers: first, they do not seek special
psychic powers for their own advantage, and second, the benefits to
others are not enough to warrant the difficulty and time required to
develop them, as described in the Visuddhimagga. (See
Note <a href="#note-difficulty">Difficulty of Psychic Powers</a>) {459} Arahants are more likely to use the
time and effort to teach others, which is called the ‘miracle of
teaching’ (<em>anusāsanī-pāṭihāriya</em>) and which the Buddha praised as the
greatest of all miracles.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn102">102</a></sup> This is superior to concerning oneself
with mundane psychic powers, which are potentially harmful and lead
ordinary people to be fascinated in a mysterious and obscure world that
lies beyond their ability to understand and causes them to neglect more
important activities.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Difficulty of Psychic Powers</span><a id="note-difficulty"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vism. 371-426 (especially 375-6) illustrates the difficulty of
developing psychic powers (probably based on Ps. I. 111-15):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Now the kasiṇa preliminary work is difficult for a beginner and
only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. The arousing of the
sign is difficult for one who has done the preliminary work and only
one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. To extend the sign when it
has arisen and to reach absorption is difficult and only one in a
hundred or a thousand can do it. To tame one’s mind in the fourteen
ways after reaching absorption is difficult and only one in a
hundred or a thousand can do it. The application of supernormal
power after training one’s mind in this way is difficult and only
one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. The rapid attainment of
jhāna after application is difficult and only one in a hundred or a
thousand can do it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Normally, people seek protection in external conditions or divine
powers, which opposes fundamental Buddhist principles. Arahants who do
not wield mundane psychic powers still possess what the Buddha called a
‘noble power’ (<em>ariya-iddhi</em>): they are able to look at unendearing,
repulsive people and things as endearing and not repulsive. Similarly,
they can see attractive, alluring people and things as impermanent,
conditioned, and unworthy of attachment. This is a greater power than
walking on water, diving into the ground, or flying through the air,
which the Buddha said are not ‘noble’, carry risks, and do not lead to
liberation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn103">103</a></sup></p>
<p>These mundane psychic powers are not the essence of Buddhism and they
are not an indication of a person’s value. One can find evidence of
these powers before the time of the Buddha and in other traditions. They
are only considered excellent when applied by one who is pure and fully
awakened. For ordinary people they can be as dangerous as they are
helpful. A fully awakened person or even someone attained to a lesser
stage of awakening, who has moral conduct and perfect ‘right-view’
(<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>), is superior to someone possessing the five mundane
powers but devoid of these virtues. Most of the Buddha’s arahant
disciples are ‘liberated by wisdom’ (<em>paññā-vimutta</em>), without elevating
to higher levels of concentrative attainment, and even many of the
disciples ‘liberated both ways’ (<em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>) did not generate
the five mundane powers. {460}</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#basic-principles-of-insight-practice" id="basic-principles-of-insight-practice">Basic Principles of Insight Practice</a></h2>
<p>The contemplation of conditioned phenomena giving rise to clear
understanding and to seeing things as they truly are is an essential
ingredient to realizing path and fruit. Everyone who practises for the
goal of Buddhism, whether they use tranquillity or insight as a vehicle,
and regardless of which of the four modes of practice (tranquillity
preceded by insight, etc.) they follow, must pass this stage of insight
(<em>vipassanā</em>) meditation. Someone who uses insight as a vehicle will
practise in this way from the beginning, whereas someone using
tranquillity as a vehicle will apply this meditation in the final
stages.</p>
<p>Drawing upon the previous section on tranquillity meditation, this
contemplation is an extension of the earlier cited passage: <em>By seeing
with wisdom the taints are completely destroyed</em>. In other words, it
refers to ‘liberation by wisdom’ (<em>paññā-vimutti</em>). There are many
standard definitions in the Pali Canon to describe this path of insight.
Before looking at these definitions, let us examine some passages
describing the Buddha’s enlightenment (which are also outlines of
insight). This will reveal how a single event can be explained in many
different ways:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>When my knowledge and vision of these Four Noble Truths as they really
are in their three phases and twelve aspects was thoroughly purified
in this way, then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed
perfect enlightenment in this world.... The knowledge and vision arose
in me: ‘Unshakable is the liberation of my mind. This is my last
birth. Now there is no more renewed existence.’</p>
<p><em>Vin. I. 11; S. V. 422-3.</em></p>
<p>When I directly knew as they really are the gratification (assāda),
the danger (ādīnava) and the escape (nissaraṇa) in the case of these
five aggregates subject to clinging, then I claimed to have awakened
to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world.... ‘Now there
is no more renewed existence.’</p>
<p><em>S. III. 28.</em></p>
<p>When I directly knew as they really are the gratification, the danger
and the escape in the case of these six internal sense bases, then I
claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in
this world.... ‘Now there is no more renewed existence.’ {461}</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 7-8.</em></p>
<p>When I directly knew as they really are the origin and the passing
away, the gratification, the danger and the escape in the case of
these five spiritual faculties (i.e. faith, energy, mindfulness,
concentration and wisdom), then I claimed to have awakened to the
unsurpassed perfect enlightenment in this world.... ‘Now there is no
more renewed existence.’</p>
<p><em>S. V. 204.</em></p>
<p>When I directly knew as they really are the origin and the passing
away, the gratification, the danger and the escape in the case of
these six sense faculties (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind),
then I claimed to have awakened to the unsurpassed perfect
enlightenment in this world.... ‘Now there is no more renewed
existence.’</p>
<p><em>S. V. 206.</em></p>
<p>Monks, concentration by mindfulness of breathing, when developed and
cultivated, is of great fruit and benefit.... I too, monks, before my
enlightenment, while I was still a bodhisatta, not yet fully
enlightened, frequently dwelt in this abiding. While I frequently
dwelt in this abiding, neither my body nor my eyes became fatigued and
my mind, by not clinging, was liberated from the taints.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 316-17.</em></p>
<p>‘Feeling (vedanā) is this way.’ Thus, monks, in regard to things
unheard before, there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true
knowledge, and light.... ‘This is the origin of feeling’.... ‘This is
the way leading to the origination of feeling’.... ‘This is the
cessation of feeling’.... ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of
feeling’.... ‘This is the gratification in feeling’.... ‘This is the
danger in feeling’.... ‘This is the escape from feeling’: thus monks
... there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and
light.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 233-4.</em></p>
<p>‘This is the contemplation of the body in the body (kāye
kāyānupassanā).’ Thus, monks, in regard to things unheard before,
there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and
light.... ‘That contemplation of the body in the body is to be
developed’.... ‘That contemplation of the body in the body has been
developed’.... ‘This is the contemplation of feelings in feelings’....
‘This is the contemplation of mind in mind’.... ‘This is the
contemplation of phenomena (dhamma) in phenomena’.... ‘That
contemplation of phenomena in phenomena has been developed’: thus
monks ... light.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn104">104</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 178-9.</em></p>

Thus, monks, in regard to things unheard before, there arose in me
vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge, and light.... ‘That basis

for spiritual power of enthusiasm has been developed’.... ‘This is the
basis for spiritual power of energy’.... ‘This is the basis for
spiritual power of dedicated application of mind (citta)’.... ‘This is

</div>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, before my enlightenment, while I was still a bodhisatta, not
yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me: ‘Alas, this world has fallen
into trouble, in that it is born, ages, and dies, it passes away and
is reborn, yet it does not understand the escape from this suffering
[headed by] aging-and-death. When now will an escape be discerned
from this suffering [headed by] aging-and-death?’</p>
<p>Then, monks, it occurred to me: ‘When what exists does aging-and-death
come to be? By what is aging-and-death conditioned?’ Then, monks,
through careful attention, there took place in me a breakthrough by
wisdom: ‘When there is birth, aging-and-death comes to be;
aging-and-death has birth as its condition....’</p>
<p>‘When what exists does birth come to be? ... does becoming come to be?
... does clinging come to be? ... does craving come to be? ... does
feeling come to be? ... does contact come to be? ... do the six sense
bases come to be? ... does mind-and-body come to be? ... Then, monks,
the question occurred to me: ‘When what exists does consciousness come
to be? By what is consciousness conditioned?’ Then monks, through
careful attention, there took place in me a breakthrough by wisdom:
‘When there is mind-and-body, consciousness comes to be; consciousness
has mind-and-body as its condition.’</p>
<p>Then, monks, it occurred to me: ‘This consciousness turns back; it
does not go further than mind-and-body. It is to this extent that one
may be born and age and die, pass away and be reborn, that is, when
there is consciousness with mind-and-body as its condition and
mind-and-body with consciousness as its condition. With mind-and-body
as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as
condition, contact.... Such is the origin of this whole mass of
suffering.’</p>
<p>‘Origination, origination’ – thus, monks, in regard to things unheard
before there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge,
and light.</p>
<p>Then, monks, it occurred to me: ‘When what does not exist does
aging-and-death not come to be? With the cessation of what does the
cessation of aging-and-death come about?’ Then, monks, through careful
attention, there took place in me a breakthrough by wisdom: ‘When
there is no birth, aging-and-death does not come to be; with the
cessation of birth comes cessation of aging-and-death....’</p>
<p>‘When what does not exist does birth not come to be? ... does becoming
not come to be? ... does clinging not come to be? ... does craving not
come to be? ... does feeling not come to be? ... does contact not come
to be? ... do the six sense bases not come to be? ... does
mind-and-body not come to be? ... Then, monks, it occurred to me:
‘When what exists does consciousness not come to be? With the
cessation of what does the cessation of consciousness come about?’
Then monks, through careful attention, there took place in me a
breakthrough by wisdom: ‘When there is no mind-and-body, consciousness
does not come to be; with the cessation of mind-and-body comes
cessation of consciousness.’</p>
<p>Then, monks, it occurred to me: ‘I have discovered this path to
enlightenment, that is, with the cessation of mind-and-body comes
cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness comes
cessation of mind-and-body; with the cessation of mind-and-body,
cessation of the six sense bases; with the cessation of the six sense
bases, cessation of contact.... Such is the cessation of this whole
mass of suffering.</p>
<p>‘Cessation, cessation’ – thus, monks, in regard to things unheard
before there arose in me vision, knowledge, wisdom, true knowledge,
and light.</p>
<p>So too, monks, I saw the ancient path, the ancient road travelled by
the Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the past.... It is just this Noble
Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention ... right
concentration. I followed that path and by doing so I have directly
known aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading
to its cessation. I have directly known birth ... becoming ...
clinging ... craving ... feeling ... contact ... the six sense bases
... mind-and-body ... consciousness ... volitional formations, their
origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation. {463}
Having directly known them, I have explained them to the bhikkhus, the
bhikkhunīs, the male lay followers, and the female lay followers. This
holy life, monks, has become successful and prosperous, popular,
widespread, firmly established, well-proclaimed among devas and
humans.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn106">106</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>There are many standard definitions for the realization of arahantship
through insight by the Buddha’s disciples. Some are similar to the
passages presented above of the Buddha’s enlightenment while others
vary, but essentially they are the same: phenomena (most often the five
aggregates or the twelve sense spheres) are divided into different parts
and their true nature is examined according to the three
characteristics: impermanence, <em>dukkha</em> and not-self. Many passages
focus on the belief in self and emphasize the characteristic of
not-self. Some passages trace the relationship between conditions in the
context of Dependent Origination. From the angle of Dhamma practice,
these passages all refer to one or more of the groups found in the
thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (<em>bodhipakkhiya-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn107">107</a></sup>
The outlines explaining particular ways of contemplation can be
extremely helpful for insight practice if one can capture their meaning
and not get confused by the technical language. Below are some examples
of these outlines; the commentaries say the Buddha gave these teachings
on different occasions depending on the disposition of the
listener.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn108">108</a></sup></p>

<p><em>S. III. 22, 82-3.</em></p>
<p>Monks, the body is not-self. If the body were self it would not lead
to affliction, and it would be possible to have it of the body: ‘May

<h2><a class="header" href="#systematic-outlines-of-meditation-practice" id="systematic-outlines-of-meditation-practice">Systematic Outlines of Meditation Practice</a></h2>
<p>The Buddha’s teachings on ways to realize Nibbāna usually include the
contemplations of phenomena as presented earlier in this chapter. When
these teachings are presented systematically, then the stages of
practice are usually presented in a broad, general sense. The most
detailed and frequent systematic teaching outlines the ‘holy life’ or
way of practice of a bhikkhu from the time of ordination up to the
cessation of the taints.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn125">125</a></sup> A similar teaching given occasionally by
the Buddha and his disciples is that of the fifteen ways of practice
(<em>caraṇa</em>) and the three kinds of knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn126">126</a></sup>
Alternatively, one finds a group of gradual attainments, for example the
seven purifications<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn127">127</a></sup> or the nine purifications.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn128">128</a></sup> We can assume
that the reason these teachings are presented in a general way is that
the specific details of practice were transmitted through direct
application, according to the methods particular teachers used to train
their students. Minor details would have differed among different
teachers. These styles of practice would have been passed down until the
time of the commentators, who compiled and recorded some of them. The
most prominent of these later texts is the Visuddhimagga.</p>
<p>The Visuddhimagga presents a gradual course of practice, both in regard
to external activities as well as to the development of wisdom. In terms
of wisdom, it outlines the stages of higher knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>). Its
general framework follows the teaching on the three ‘trainings’
(<em>sikkhā</em>) and then expands these in terms of the seven purifications
(<em>visuddhi</em>). The gradual development of insight (<em>vipassanā-ñāṇa</em>)
found in the Visuddhimagga is an expansion from material found in the
Paṭisambhidāmagga.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn129">129</a></sup> Below is a summary of the systematic teaching
found in the Visuddhimagga.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn130">130</a></sup></p>
<p>First, let us look at the meaning of some important terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Visuddhi:</em> purity; gradual purification; qualities that purify
beings, enabling a perfection of the threefold training and leading
to the realization of Nibbāna. There are seven stages, to be
discussed below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pariññā:</em> comprehensive knowledge, of which there are three
kinds:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn131">131</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Ñāta-pariññā</em>: familiarity; recognition; knowledge of specific
attributes. For example, one knows ‘sensation’ (<em>vedanā</em>) and knows
that it has the quality of ‘feeling’ sense impressions; one knows
perception (<em>saññā</em>) and knows that perception has the function of
designation. One knows ‘what things are’. {476}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tīraṇa-pariññā</em>: investigation; one applies a deeper level of
wisdom, by knowing the universal characteristics of things: that
they follow natural laws and are characterized by impermanence,
stress, and nonself. For example, one knows that feeling and
perception are unstable, of the nature to change, and not-self. One
knows ‘how things are’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Pahāna-pariññā</em>: abandonment; knowledge that leads to letting go of
attachment, to freedom, and to an absence of infatuation. One knows
how to respond to and behave in relation to things. For example,
knowing that things are impermanent, one abandons the perception of
permanence (<em>nicca-saññā</em>). One knows ‘how to act’.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><em>Vipassanā-ñāṇa:</em> insight knowledge; knowledge that gives rise to
insight; knowledge that leads to a thorough understanding of
phenomena and to the end of suffering. It is divided into nine kinds
(see below).</li>
</ul>
<p>The different kinds of knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>) below that are followed by
numbers in parentheses are part of the more recently formed group of
sixteen kinds of knowledge (<em>soḷasa-ñāṇa</em>). They are used to verify a
person’s level of attainment.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn132">132</a></sup></p>

<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Purification of morality (<em>sīla-visuddhi</em>): good conduct; right
livelihood; ethical conduct appropriate to one’s social standing.
The Visuddhimagga focuses primarily on the four moral standards for
purity (<em>pārisuddhi-sīla</em>) for bhikkhus:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A.</strong> <em>Pāṭimokkhasaṁvara-sīla</em>: restraint and strict adherence in
relation to the monastic code of discipline.</p>
<p><em>Indriyasaṁvara-sīla</em>: restraint of the sense faculties; caution
while receiving sense impressions in order to prevent unskilful
mental states from possessing the mind.</p>
<p><em>Ājīvapārisuddhi-sīla</em>: right livelihood.</p>
<p><em>Paccayasannissita-sīla</em>: pure conduct in regard to the four
requisites of life; using these requisites with wise reflection,
not with greed.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn133">133</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Apart from keeping moral precepts, it is recommended to undertake, as is
suitable to one’s personal disposition, some of the thirteen austere
practices (<em>dhutaṅga</em>), which were permitted by the Buddha, in order to
increase contentment, effort, and seclusion, to eliminate defilements,
to purify one’s moral conduct, to complement and fulfil one’s other
religious observances, and to support one’s overall spiritual practice.</p>

<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li><strong>2.</strong> Purification of mind (<em>citta-visuddhi</em>): to develop the quality and
ability of the mind until there is adequate concentration to act as
a basis for insight. The Visuddhimagga says this extends from access
concentration (<em>upacāra-samādhi</em>) up to attainment concentration of
the eight jhānas. It presents ways of developing concentration up to
the attainment of the five mundane supernormal powers (<em>abhiññā</em>).

<p><em>A. Knowledge of Conditions (<em>ñāta-pariññā</em>)</em></p>
<p><strong>Recognition of the Noble Truth of Suffering:</strong></p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li><strong>3.</strong> Purification of views (<em>diṭṭhi-visuddhi</em>): knowledge of the true
nature of the body and mind which removes the misapprehension of
self-view. This level of purification is also called the ‘definitive
knowledge of mind and body’ (<em>nāmarūpapariccheda-ñāṇa</em>) (1).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn134">134</a></sup>
Here, one knows that all existing things fall under the category of
either mind (<em>nāma</em>) or matter (<em>rūpa</em>; ‘body’), and one is able to
distinguish through one’s own experience what is mind and what is
matter. For example, when seeing an object one knows that the sense
base of the eye, the light, the visual form, and the colour are
aspects of materiality, while the eye-consciousness or the act of
seeing is an aspect of mentality.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recognition of the Noble truth of the Origin of Suffering:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4.</strong> Purification of knowledge leading to the end of doubt
(<em>kaṅkhāvitaraṇa-visuddhi</em>): one accurately knows the conditionality
of mind and body in line with Dependent Origination, the law of
kamma, the process of cognition, the three ‘cycles’ (<em>vaṭṭa</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn135">135</a></sup>
or any other perspective revealing that all conditioned things
originate from conditioning factors and are interdependent. This
knowledge brings to an end doubt about the three periods of time:
the past, the present, and the future. It is also called the
‘knowledge of conditioning factors of mind and body’
(<em>nāmarūpapaccayapariggaha-ñāṇa</em>) (2).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn136">136</a></sup> The commentaries refer
to someone with this knowledge as a ‘little stream-enterer’
(<em>cūḷa-sotāpanna</em>): his or her destiny is assured as one progressing
in the Buddha’s teaching.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>B. Thorough Knowledge of the Three Characteristics (<em>tīraṇa-pariññā</em>)</em></p>
<p><strong>Recognition of the Noble Truth of the Path:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Purification of knowledge regarding Path and not-path
(<em>maggāmaggañāṇadassana-visuddhi</em>): the investigation of material
and immaterial phenomena (<em>nāma-rūpa</em>) in light of the Three
Characteristics. For example, one reflects on the nature of form as
being impermanent (<em>anicca</em>), subject to stress (<em>dukkha</em>), and
nonself (<em>anattā</em>), and then reflects in a similar manner on the
four immaterial aggregates: feeling, perception, volitional
formations, and consciousness. This investigation extends to all
groups of phenomena, for example the twelve sense spheres
(<em>āyatana</em>), the twelve factors of Dependent Origination
(<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>), the three realms (<em>bhava</em>), the four jhānas,
the four unbounded states (<em>appamaññā</em>), and the eight concentrative
attainments (<em>samāpatti</em>), all of which fall under the category of
the five aggregates, until one discerns the arising and passing away
of conditioned phenomena. This investigation gives rise to
‘incipient’ insight (<em>taruṇa-vipassanā</em>). At this point the ten
‘defilements of in-sight’ (<em>vipassanūpakilesa</em>) may also arise,
causing a person to believe falsely that he is enlightened or
leading a person to attach to these mental qualities. This
misunderstanding results in misdirected practice. If one possesses
mindfulness and clear comprehension, however, then one is able to
distinguish the correct path and avoid getting stuck in these
defilements. It is at this point that one reaches the purification
of knowledge regarding Path and not-path. {478}</p>
<p>There are some complicated passages in the Visuddhimagga on this
level of purification. The level of insight required to generate
this purification is called ‘inductive insight’ (<em>naya-vipassanā</em>):
a person contemplates by using a method of investigation described
in the Pali Canon. For example, one may reflect that a particular
form (<em>rūpa</em>), past, present or future, internal or external, etc.,
is impermanent without exception. It is also called ‘contemplation
by groups’ (<em>kalāpa-sammasana</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn137">137</a></sup> The knowledge arising at this
stage of purification is sometimes called ‘investigative knowledge’
(of mind and body in light of the three characteristics):
<em>sammasana-ñāṇa</em> (3).</p>
<p>When this investigative knowledge becomes strong and one begins to
see the rising and falling of all things – to see the transitory
nature of things, that every object exists dependent on conditioning
factors and ceases to exist when these factors are absent – the
‘knowledge of birth and decay’ (<em>udayabbaya-ñāṇa</em>) gradually comes
about. But this knowledge is new and at this stage is called
‘incipient insight’ (<em>taruṇa-vipassanā</em> or <em>taruṇavipassanā-ñāṇa</em>).
A person possessing this incipient insight is called a ‘beginner of
insight’ (<em>āraddha-vipassaka</em>) and is susceptible to the
‘defilements of insight’, for example luminosity in the mind, which
tend to distract and obstruct practitioners. With proper discernment
one is able to pass beyond these defilements and complete this stage
of purification.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>C. Knowledge Resulting in Liberation and the Abandonment of Ignorance
(<em>pahāna-pariññā</em>)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Purification of Knowledge of the Way of Practice
(<em>paṭipadāñāṇadassana-visuddhi</em>): this refers to the highest level
of insight endowed with the nine stages of ‘insight-knowledge’
(<em>vipassanā-ñāṇa</em>), beginning with the knowledge of birth and decay
and the subsequent release from the defilements of insight, up to
the final stages of insight: to full awakening. These are the nine
stages of insight-knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A.</strong>  Knowledge of birth and decay (<em>udayabbayānupassanā-ñāṇa</em> or
<em>udayabbaya-ñāṇa</em>) (4): the clear seeing of the arising and
passing away of the five aggregates. The understanding that all
things are impermanent and unable to sustain their original
state, and that they are not subject to control by desire.
Everything that is subject to arising is subject to cessation.
In each moment of cognition a person here discerns the
origination of ‘mind’ (<em>nāma-dhamma</em>), ‘body’ (<em>rūpa-dhamma</em>),
and the act of ‘knowing’ (’the one who knows’), and sees the
simultaneous cessation of all these qualities. This insight is
powerful (<em>balava-vipassanā</em>) and dispels the perception of
permanence (<em>nicca-saññā</em>), the perception of inherent happiness
(<em>sukha-saññā</em>), and the perception of self (<em>atta-saññā</em>).
{479}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Knowledge of dissolution (<em>bhaṅgānupassanā-ñāṇa</em> or
<em>bhaṅga-ñāṇa</em>) (5): when one is able to see this birth and decay
in a more continuous, uninterrupted way, one begins to focus on
the end point, on cessation. One reflects that all things are
subject to dissolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Knowledge of the fearfulness of the appearance of conditions
(<em>bhayatūpaṭṭhāna-ñāṇa or bhaya-ñāṇa</em>) (6): by contemplating
dissolution, to which all things are subject, one sees that all
conditioned things, regardless of which realm of existence they
are found, are terrifying since they offer no safety and must
come to destruction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Knowledge of disadvantages (<em>ādīnavānupassanā-ñāṇa</em> or
<em>ādīnava-ñāṇa</em>) (7): when one sees that all things are subject
to decay and offer no safety, one reflects on the disadvantages,
flaws, and inherent unsatisfactoriness of things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Knowledge of disenchantment (<em>nibbidānupassanā-ñāṇa</em> or

conditioned things, one becomes disenchanted with them and does
not indulge in them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>F.</strong> Knowledge of the desire for deliverance (<em>muñcitukamyatā-ñāṇa</em>)
(9): with the arising of disenchantment, one wishes to escape
from conditioned phenomena.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>G.</strong> Reflective knowledge (for seeing the Path):
<em>paṭisaṅkhānupassanā-ñāṇa or paṭisaṅkhā-ñāṇa</em> (10): with the
wish to escape, one resumes the investigation of conditions in
light of the three characteristics to find a way to gain
freedom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>H.</strong> Knowledge of equanimity regarding all formations
(<em>saṅkhārupekkhā-ñāṇa</em>) (11): when one investigates conditioned
things, one sees their true nature and develops equanimity
towards them. One is neither delighted by nor averse to
conditions. One sees Nibbāna as a ‘way of peace’ (<em>santi-pada</em>).
One lets go of attachment to conditioned things and gravitates
towards Nibbāna. This knowledge is also known as ‘pinnacle
insight’ (<em>sikhāpatta-vipassanā</em>), because it reaches the
highest goal, or ‘generative insight’
(<em>vuṭṭhānagāminī-vipassanā</em>), because it links a person to the
Path, which is the way out of attachment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I.</strong> Compatible knowledge (for realizing the truth):
<em>saccānulomika-ñāṇa</em> or <em>anuloma-ñāṇa</em> (12): when one has
developed equanimity and one is intent on Nibbāna, knowledge
favourable to realizing the truth follows. This is the final
stage of insight-knowledge.</p>
<p>Following from ‘compatible knowledge’ is ‘lineage knowledge’
(<em>gotrabhū-ñāṇa</em>) (13): knowledge that marks the transition
point between an ordinary person and an awakened person. From
this point path-knowledge (<em>magga-ñāṇa</em>) arises, which leads to
awakening. Lineage-knowledge does not fall into either stage of
purity, neither the previous stage of ‘purification of knowledge
of the way of practice’ nor the following stage of ‘purity of
knowledge and vision’, but rather it falls in between. However,
it is still considered to be a distinct level of insight since
it is part of the insight process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Purity of Knowledge and Vision (<em>ñāṇadassana-visuddhi</em>): this purity
follows from ‘lineage knowledge’ and is equivalent to path-knowledge
(<em>magga-ñāṇa</em>) (14). The arising of a particular path-knowledge is
followed by a corresponding ‘fruit-knowledge’ (<em>phala-ñāṇa</em>) (15),
depending on the level of awakening. As stated above, it is this
purity that enables a person to be enlightened and reach the highest
goal of Buddhism. {480}</p>
<p>With realization through path- and fruit-knowledge, reviewing
knowledge (<em>paccavekkhaṇa-ñāṇa</em>) (16) arises, which reflects on path
and fruit, on abandoned defilements, on remaining defilements, and
on Nibbāna (arahants do not reflect on remaining defilements). This
reviewing knowledge concludes the process of realizing a particular
stage of enlightenment.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-1-jhāna" id="appendix-1-jhāna">Appendix 1: Jhāna</a></h2>
<p>The jhānas will be discussed in more detail in the section on right
concentration,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn138">138</a></sup> but since they have been mentioned here I will
provide some basic information.</p>
<p>The four jhānas – the standard group found in the suttas – are the
four fine-material jhānas. In the Abhidhamma these four jhānas are
expanded into five jhānas. The fifth jhāna is equivalent to the fourth
in the original quartet. (The quartet is called <em>jhāna-catukkanaya</em>, the
quintet <em>jhāna-pañcakanaya</em>.)</p>
<p>Jhāna (’focused attention’, ‘meditation’) is a state of heightened
concentration, of the mind being one-pointed on an object. There are
different levels of this concentration based on refinement, depth, and
strength. These levels can be determined by the mental qualities present
during these periods of concentration. These qualities are: applied
thought (<em>vitakka</em>), sustained thought (<em>vicāra</em>), bliss (<em>pīti</em>), joy
(<em>sukha</em>), equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>), and one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>). The
four fine-material jhānas have the following qualities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First jhāna: applied thought, sustained thought, bliss, joy, and
one-pointedness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second jhāna: bliss, joy, and one-pointedness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third jhāna: joy and one-pointedness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fourth jhāna: equanimity and one-pointedness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The jhānas higher than these are the formless jhānas (<em>arūpa-jhāna</em>).
The formless jhānas have the qualities of equanimity and
one-pointedness, but are increasingly more refined depending on the
objects of concentration. For more detail, see the section on <em>vimokkha</em>
(levels 4-7).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn139">139</a></sup> {425}</p>
<p>The term jhāna can be used in a broad sense for ‘focus’, ‘examination’,
or ‘pondering’. Sometimes it is used in a negative sense for an activity
criticized by the Buddha. For example, it can be a way of harbouring the
five hindrances – lust, malice, despondency, agitation and doubt – in
the heart. To allow these hindrances to gnaw away at the mind in a state
of brooding is also called jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn140">140</a></sup> Jhāna is also used in the verb
form for animals, for example an owl staring at a mouse or a fox hunting
for fish.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn141">141</a></sup> Sometimes it is used in the context of <em>vipassanā</em>
meditation meaning ‘investigation’ or ‘reflection’. The commentaries
occasionally divide jhāna into two types: the focusing of an object in
<em>samatha</em> meditation (<em>ārammaṇūpanijjhāna</em> = 8 <em>jhāna-samāpatti</em>), and
the reflection giving rise to insight into the three characteristics
(<em>lakkhaṇūpanijjhāna</em> = <em>vipassanā</em>). Even path and fruit can be called
jhāna since these are referred to as ‘eradicating defilements’ and
‘focusing on the unsubstantiality (<em>suññatā</em>) of Nibbāna’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn142">142</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-2-is-it-possible-to-develop-insight-or-to-become-enlightened-in-jhāna" id="appendix-2-is-it-possible-to-develop-insight-or-to-become-enlightened-in-jhāna">Appendix 2: Is It Possible To Develop Insight or to Become Enlightened in Jhāna?</a></h2>
<p>{481} There is much debate as to whether it is possible to develop
insight or to apply wise reflection while in jhāna. Those people who
claim it is not possible tend to refer to the ‘factors’ of jhāna: in the
first jhāna a person possesses applied and sustained thought (<em>vitakka</em>
&amp; <em>vicāra</em>), while in higher jhānas a person has at most bliss, joy and
one-pointedness, so in this case how can someone be engaged in thinking
or reflection? In fact, these factors of jhāna are simply used as
criteria for determining whether one has attained jhāna and for
determining the level of jhāna. It is not implied that these are the
only mental qualities present in jhāna.</p>
<p>In fact, the mind is endowed with many qualities while in jhāna, as is
verified in the suttas and the older texts of the Abhidhamma. For
example, M. III. 26-7 describes the mental qualities associated with
every level of jhāna, from the first jhāna to the sphere of nothingness,
including: enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>), determination (<em>adhimokkha</em>), energy
(<em>viriya</em>), mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>), and attention
(<em>manasikāra</em>). Similarly, Dhs. 31 &amp; 75 describe the numerous qualities
present at each level of jhāna, especially in ‘transcendent’
jhāna,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn143">143</a></sup> including: the five spiritual faculties of faith, energy,
mindfulness, concentration and wisdom, the complete set of eight factors
of the Noble Path, and both tranquillity and insight. Some later
commentaries<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn144">144</a></sup> expand upon the passages at PsA. I. 132, Vism. 148-9
&amp; NdA. I. 133, and make it clear that concentration and wisdom act in
unison in ‘the mind of jhāna’ (<em>jhāna-citta</em>). {482}</p>
<p>The reason that applied and sustained thought are absent in higher
jhānas is because the mind is firmly established and greatly empowered.
It is not necessary to turn attention (<em>vitakka</em>) to objects in the mind
or to sustain attention (<em>vicāra</em>) on these objects. The reflection
present in the mind excels these modes of attention. The Visuddhimagga
describes the development of insight in this way:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>One whose vehicle is serenity should emerge from any fine-material or
immaterial jhāna, except the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, and he should discern,
according to characteristic, function, etc., the jhāna factors
consisting of applied thought, etc.</p>
<p><em>Vism. 557.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>One can interpret the phrase ‘should emerge ... and he should discern’
as describing one particular mode of practice, since the sub-commentary
of this text explains:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The term ‘one whose vehicle is serenity’ here is a name for one who
abides in jhāna or abides in access-concentration and is practising
insight meditation.</p>
<p><em>VismṬ.: Diṭṭhivisuddhiniddesavaṇṇanā, Nāmarūpapariggahakathāvaṇṇanā.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>There is disagreement among the sub-commentaries as to whether it is
possible to develop insight in jhāna or whether one must first exit from
jhāna. Apart from AA. IV. 195 and the VismṬ.,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn145">145</a></sup> the only other
passage giving evidence of developing insight while in jhāna is DA. II.
512, which refers to arahants who are liberated by wisdom
(<em>paññā-vimutta</em>):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>There are five kinds of persons liberated by wisdom: the pure-insight
practitioner and those who dwell in one of the four jhānas, for
example the first jhāna, and realize arahantship.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>All remaining passages describe first exiting from jhāna, especially
when referring directly to the development of insight. The descriptions
are similar, for example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Having dwelled in and emerged from jhāna, one reflects on the factors
of jhāna and associated qualities; Having dwelled in jhāna and emerged
from this attainment, one investigates all conditioned phenomena;
Having emerged from the attainment, one reflects on the factors of
attainment; Having emerged from jhāna, one reflects on the qualities
of jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn146">146</a></sup></p>
<p><em>VinA. II. 430, 433.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Taking these passages as a whole, the commentarial opinion is generally
that if one enters jhāna one must first exit in order to develop
insight. Since there is no clear explanation in the commentaries and
sub-commentaries, it is difficult to definitively settle the various
arguments, but it is possible to strike some sort of compromise by
connecting evidence from different sources.</p>
<p>The format for developing insight by emerging from jhāna and
contemplating conditioned phenomena comes from secondary texts of the
Tipiṭaka. A clear example is the interpretation of this passage in the
Sutta-Nipāta:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>When a person knows the factors giving rise to the sphere of
nothingness and knows the binding power of delight, then he clearly
discerns the sphere of nothingness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn147">147</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Sn. 216.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Cūḷaniddesa, a secondary text, explains the phrase ‘he clearly
discerns the sphere of nothingness’ as: <em>He enters and emerges from the
sphere of nothingness, and discerns the mind and mental constituents
arising in that sphere of nothingness as impermanent, subject to stress,
[etc].</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn148">148</a></sup> The commentaries of both texts offer a similar
explanation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn149">149</a></sup></p>
<p>These explanations from secondary texts and sub-commentaries all follow
the outline of the Abhidhamma. The Abhidhamma presents a detailed
analysis of things and breaks the mind down into separate mind moments,
describing the activity of the mind in relation to other factors, for
example the involvement with sense impressions. The Abhidhamma claims it
is not possible to develop insight in jhāna because at the moment of
concentrative attainment the mind is one-pointed on the ‘object of
awareness’ (<em>ārammaṇa</em>) pertaining to jhāna. The objects of awareness
involved in insight practice are separate and therefore one cannot
develop insight during the same mind moment of jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn150">150</a></sup> One must
first take attention away from the object of awareness (in jhāna) and
focus on another object, which means emerging from jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn151">151</a></sup> This is
not a big step: it simply requires an adjustment or interruption in the
stream of awareness (of one-pointedness) and an entering into
‘subliminal consciousness’ (<em>bhavaṅga</em>), which is the equivalent to
exiting jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn152">152</a></sup> {483}</p>
<p>Having emerged from jhāna, the mind immediately resumes the stability of
‘attainment concentration’ (<em>appanā-samādhi</em>) due to the strength of
mind developed in jhāna. (People may misunderstand that exiting jhāna
implies returning to a state of mental disturbance or confusion.) A
person then uses attainment concentration to develop insight, by
contemplating the factors present at the level of jhāna from which he
has just emerged and seeing them in light of the three
characteristics.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn153">153</a></sup> These factors become the objects of insight. (To
speak in a comprehensive way, a person contemplates aspects of jhāna
(<em>jhāna-dhamma</em>), things associated with jhāna
(<em>jhānasampayutta-dhamma</em>), aspects of attainment (<em>samāpatti-dhamma</em>),
things associated with attainment (<em>samāpattisampayutta-dhamma</em>), the
mind and mental constituents arising in jhāna, or even all conditioned
phenomena.)</p>
<p>The concentration of jhāna (and even more so of the higher psychic
attainments) makes the practice of insight more effective and
proficient, which is the special value of insight preceded by
tranquillity meditation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn154">154</a></sup> The commentaries use the expression
‘developing insight with jhāna as a basis’ for this process of applying
the strength of concentration derived from jhāna to contemplate
conditioned reality. Jhāna here is called ‘jhāna acting as foundation
for insight’,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn155">155</a></sup> and various terms are used according to the level of
jhāna reached, e.g.: ‘using first jhāna as foundation’, ‘using second
jhāna as foundation’, ‘using the sphere of nothingness as foundation’,
‘insight with first jhāna as a basis’, ‘insight with second jhāna as a
basis’, ‘insight with formless jhāna as a basis’, etc. The higher the
level of jhāna, the deeper and stronger the concentration applied for
insight.</p>
<p>The wisdom gleaned from this insight practice can also be classified
according to the level of jhāna, e.g.: ‘the insight wisdom of first
jhāna’ or ‘first jhāna insight-wisdom’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn156">156</a></sup> The level of Path
attainment (<em>magga</em>) is dependent on the level of jhāna used as a basis,
except in the cases of the ‘sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception’ and the ‘extinction of perception
and feeling’. (On the relationship between <em>magga</em> and jhāna, see a
divergent opinion at e.g. DhsA. 228 &amp; Vism. 666-7, which was referred to
earlier.)</p>
<p>We can see from the above that the teachings on developing insight while
in jhāna and those on first exiting jhāna before practising insight are
not contradictory. The first can be called the teaching from the suttas
and is more general. In this teaching, the word ‘jhāna’ refers to both
the actual state of jhāna and to the stability of mind generated by the
power of jhāna. The expression ‘developing insight in jhāna’ refers to
entering jhāna and then using the strength of jhāna to practise insight.
The second can be called the teaching of the Abhidhamma and is more
specific.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn157">157</a></sup> Here the definition of ‘jhāna’ is restricted to the
process during which the mind is one-pointed and focused on the
meditation object, say the ‘mental image’ (<em>nimitta</em>) of breathing or of
a <em>kasiṇa</em> object.</p>
<p>The Abhidhamma explains that the mind in jhāna is one-pointed on the
object of awareness throughout. When the mind begins to apply wisdom for
contemplation, the focus of awareness must move from that original
object. The Abhidhamma distinguishes the state of mind strengthened by
jhāna as a separate process, one of releasing the object of tranquillity
and exiting jhāna, although they grant that the mind is still
exceptionally concentrated. The practitioner uses this strength of mind
to develop insight and turns to the jhāna just exited along with its
attributes, e.g.: applied attention (<em>vitakka</em>), sustained attention
(<em>vicāra</em>), bliss (<em>pīti</em>), happiness (<em>sukha</em>), enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>),
and energy (<em>viriya</em>), as the objects of contemplation. This change of
focus results in exiting jhāna and entering the ‘vital continuum’
(<em>bhavaṅga</em>). From this point on, one begins a new stage of meditation,
of insight meditation (<em>vipassanā</em>). {484}</p>
<p>By making this distinction a new term was necessary to describe this
process, since despite exiting jhāna the mind does not revert back to
the state preceding jhāna. The commentators coined the expression ‘using
jhāna as a foundation’. They also referred to the principle of the
‘vital continuum’ (<em>bhavaṅga-citta</em>) to define the exit or break from
the state of jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn158">158</a></sup> From this evidence, we can conclude that the
general statement ‘developing insight in jhāna’ is equivalent to the
more specific statements found in the commentaries: ‘Having entered
jhāna, one exits and contemplates conditioned phenomena’;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn159">159</a></sup> ‘Exiting
the foundational jhāna, one contemplates phenomena’;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn160">160</a></sup> ‘Establishing
the jhāna as a basis, one develops insight’;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn161">161</a></sup> ‘Having attained
jhāna, one develops insight with jhāna as basis’;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn162">162</a></sup> and: ‘Exiting
concentrative attainment, one practises insight with a firmly
established mind’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn163">163</a></sup></p>
<p>The essential message of the sutta teachings and the Abhidhamma
teachings is the same: to apply the power of concentration generated in
jhāna and thus to foster the optimum conditions for wisdom to discern
the truth. By entering jhāna the mind is prepared for the next stage, of
contemplation (<em>vipassanā</em>). Because of the reliance on jhāna, the
commentaries call this process ‘insight with jhāna as a basis’ or
‘insight with jhāna as a cause’. This explanation is consonant with the
frequently mentioned sutta passage: <em>When my concentrated mind was thus
purified, bright ... malleable, wieldy, steady ... I directed it to
knowledge....</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn164">164</a></sup> With jhāna a person thus prepares the mind for
engagement. This state of mind is called ‘resolute’
(<em>abhinīhārakkhama</em>), and it leads to ever loftier attainments. Based on
sutta passages, the commentators attribute nine qualities to this state
of mind. The mind is:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn165">165</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>composed (<em>samāhita</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pure (<em>parisuddha</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bright (<em>pariyodāta</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clear and open (<em>anaṅgaṇa</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>free of blemish (<em>vigatūpakkilesa</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>malleable (<em>mudubhūta</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fit for work (<em>kammanīya</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>steadfast (<em>ṭhita</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>imperturbable (<em>āneñjappatta</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, someone who attains jhāna but does not use it as a basis
for insight will only develop insight with the assistance of ‘access’
(<em>upacāra</em>) or ‘momentary’ (<em>khaṇika</em>) concentration. This will be
similar to someone who develops insight without having ever attained
jhāna.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-3-is-it-possible-to-develop-insight-while-dwelling-in-the-realm-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception" id="appendix-3-is-it-possible-to-develop-insight-while-dwelling-in-the-realm-of-neither-perception-nor-non-perception">Appendix 3: Is It Possible To Develop Insight While Dwelling In the Realm of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception?</a></h2>
<p>The states of neither-perception-nor-non-perception
(<em>nevasaññānāsaññāyatana</em>) and the extinction of perception and feeling
(<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn166">166</a></sup> are classified as attainments in which
one reaps the fruit of meditation practice; they are not used directly
for the application of insight. The lower concentrative attainments,
from the realm of nothingness and below, can be used for both
experiencing the fruit of practice and for applying insight and
reflection. These lower attainments are still clearly accompanied by
perception and other mental qualities, as testified by the description
of the realm of nothingness as the pinnacle of perceptual
attainment.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn167">167</a></sup> The realm of nothingness is the highest attainment
still accompanied by perception. It is called ‘the peak of perception’
(<em>saññagga</em>), because it is the highest mundane attainment that can be
used for insight practice.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn168">168</a></sup> {485}</p>
<p><em>Nevasaññānāsaññāyatana</em> is exceptionally refined and is therefore
referred to as possessing neither ‘perception’ nor ‘non-perception’.
Another name for this state is the ‘attainment of residual formations’
(<em>saṅkhārāvasesa-samāpatti</em>), because the conditioned attributes of this
state are of a most subtle nature. In most cases, these attributes are
insufficiently distinct or coarse for insight practice. Let alone
developing insight while abiding in this state, it is almost impossible
to contemplate the attributes even after exiting. It requires at least
the level of wisdom of someone like Ven. Sāriputta, and even he was only
able to contemplate them as a group (<em>kalāpa-vipassanā</em>). Only Buddhas
are capable of discerning and analyzing each individual attribute
(<em>anupada-vipassanā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn169">169</a></sup></p>
<p>The scriptures refer to the eight concentrative attainments
(<em>samāpatti</em>) as ‘bases for insight’,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn170">170</a></sup> ‘bases for the fruits of
attainment’,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn171">171</a></sup> and collectively as a ‘basis for the attainment of
cessation’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn172">172</a></sup> This is not the case with the realm of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, which does not function in an
active way. This is seen clearly in relation to the attainment of
cessation, for which the active attainment is the realm of nothingness;
although the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is an
essential intermediate stage, it acts more as a corridor.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn173">173</a></sup> Even if
one has attained the gradual stages of concentration up to the realm of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, one will be unable to enter the
attainment of cessation if one has not prepared the mind adequately
between the realm of nothingness and the realm of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. And one will have to return to
the realm of nothingness to fulfil this prerequisite.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn174">174</a></sup></p>
<p>From this we may conclude that the realm of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception is limited to experiencing the
fruits of this particular attainment. When exiting this realm, one exits
definitively: no mind states at this level of consciousness remain. In
regard to insight practice, unlike other attainments of jhāna, one does
not exit the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception to shift
one’s focus of attention, but rather one drops to a lower level of
attainment: the realm of nothingness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn175">175</a></sup> This is an exit from the
attainment in all respects.</p>
<p>As a preliminary to insight practice, the suttas therefore use the
expression ‘exiting the realm of neither-perception-nor-non-perception’.
There is no specific mention of using the realm of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception as a ‘basis for insight’. One can
still use the expression ‘basis for insight’, as the mind is highly
refined after exiting from the realm of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, although technically the mind
applies access-concentration associated with the realm of nothingness.
Note also that the concentration in all the formless jhānas is of the
level of the fourth jhāna; it is just increasingly more refined and
removed from mental disturbances (<em>paccanīka-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn176">176</a></sup></p>
<p>The ‘extinction of perception and feeling’ (<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>) is
clearly confined to experiencing the fruits of this particular
attainment. It is not possible to develop insight while in this state,
since no perceptions or feelings (along with other aggregates –
<em>khandha</em>) accompany this attainment that can be a focus for
contemplation. A unique characteristic of this state is that it is the
only attainment (<em>samāpatti</em>) that is not classified as concentration
(<em>samādhi</em>), a fact that corroborates the assertion that one must first
exit this state to develop insight.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn177">177</a></sup> {486}</p>
<p>When exiting this state to practise insight one ought to abide in the
highest level of concentration that can be used for this activity, that
is, the state of nothingness. (One can use any level of concentration
including ‘momentary-concentration’ – <em>khaṇika-samādhi</em>, which is not
even a level of jhāna, since someone who has reached a higher level of
attainment has mastery over lower levels.) In any case, although the
‘extinction of perception and feeling’ cannot directly be used to
develop insight, accessing this attainment greatly refines the mind and
has tremendous benefits for spiritual practice.</p>

<p>Several commentarial passages address the teaching that at the moment of
realizing arahantship the mind must reach ‘attainment-concentration’
(<em>appanā-samādhi</em> = jhāna), even for someone who has never previously
entered jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn178">178</a></sup> Following the model of the Abhidhamma, these
passages outline the sequence of the mind’s activity at the moment of
realizing path and fruit<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn179">179</a></sup> for one who uses insight as a vehicle
(<em>vipassanā-yānika</em>). This outline can be illustrated thus (the numbers
in parentheses refer to distinct mind-moments):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(<em>Saṅkhārupekkhā-ñāṇa</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn180">180</a></sup> → <em>bhavaṅga</em> →) <em>mano-dvārāvajjana</em>
(mental apprehension) → (1) <em>parikamma</em> (preparation)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn181">181</a></sup> → (2)
<em>upacāra</em> (approach) → (3) <em>anuloma</em> (adaptation) → (4) <em>gotrabhū</em>
(maturation) → (5) <em>magga-citta</em> → (6-7) <em>phala-citta</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn182">182</a></sup> →
<em>bhavaṅga</em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>(<em>Saṅkhārupekkhā-ñāṇa</em> → <em>bhavaṅga</em> →) <em>mano-dvārāvajjana</em> → (1)
<em>upacāra</em> → (2) <em>anuloma</em> → (3) <em>gotrabhū</em> → (4) <em>magga-citta</em> →
(5-6-7) <em>phala-citta</em> → <em>bhavaṅga</em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The process following from the first <em>bhavaṅga</em> and including maturation
is called ‘sense-sphere impulsion’ (<em>kāmāvacara-javana</em>). As a pair,
<em>magga-</em> and <em>phala-citta</em> are called ‘transcendent attainment
impulsion’ (<em>lokuttara-appanājavana</em>).</p>
<p>Here is a broad outline of the sequence of the mind’s activity for one
who uses tranquillity as a vehicle (<em>samatha-yānika</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><em>Bhavaṅga</em> → <em>ñāṇa-vīthi</em> (consciousness-process of knowledge) →
<em>bhavaṅga</em> → <em>vipassanā-vīthi</em> (consciousness-process of
insight)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn183">183</a></sup> → <em>bhavaṅga</em> → <em>magga-vīthi</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn184">184</a></sup> → <em>bhavaṅga</em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, the knowledge and clear insight arising at the moment of
awakening, which produces a profound transformation by dispelling mental
defilement and altering personality, must be an experience that
permeates the entire heart and mind.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-5-non-returners-after-death" id="appendix-5-non-returners-after-death">Appendix 5: Non-returners After Death</a></h2>
<p>The Abhidhamma states that after death non-returners reappear in the
Pure Abodes (Suddhāvāsā) and classifies the Pure Abodes as a realm of
the fourth jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn185">185</a></sup> The Abhidhammatthavibhāvinī, however, explains
that non-returners will appear in a realm corresponding to their
particular level of jhāna; the only fixed rule is that the Pure Abodes
are exclusively for non-returners.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn186">186</a></sup> This raises the doubt as to how
the non-returners (e.g. those mentioned in the Visuddhimagga and
Visuddhimagga Mahāṭīkā) who are pure insight practitioners
(<em>suddhavipassanā-yānika</em> or <em>sukkha-vipassaka</em>) and do not attain the
fourth jhāna can appear in the Pure Abodes.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn187">187</a></sup> The
Abhidhammatthavibhāvinī responds to this doubt by saying: Although those
non-returners are pure insight practitioners, at the time of death they
invariably generate the attainments (<em>samāpatti</em>) because they have
developed concentration completely.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn188">188</a></sup> In any case, suttas of the
Pali Canon confirm that non-returners who have reached any of the first
four jhānas all reappear in the Pure Abodes.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn189">189</a></sup> Here too the
commentaries explain that these non-returners attain the fourth jhāna
before reappearing in the Pure Abodes.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn190">190</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-6-attainment-of-cessation-nirodha-samāpatti" id="appendix-6-attainment-of-cessation-nirodha-samāpatti">Appendix 6: Attainment of Cessation (nirodha-samāpatti)</a></h2>
<p>Do not be confused by the passage in the Visuddhimagga referring to
those monks who are about to enter ‘attainment of cessation’
(<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>), that states:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Let me dwell in bliss by being without consciousness here and now and
‘reaching the cessation’ (<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>) that is [similar to]
Nibbāna.</p>
<p><em>Vism. 705.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Visuddhimagga Mahāṭīkā explains this passage as: ‘Attainment of
cessation is similar to attaining “Nibbāna with no remaining fuel”
(<em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em>).’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn191">191</a></sup> A person in this attainment has no
perception and feeling and resembles someone who has died.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn192">192</a></sup> The
above passage does not imply that ‘attainment of cessation’ is the same
as Nibbāna; rather, one relies on <em>nirodha-samāpatti</em> in order to
realize Nibbāna; it is one means of coming into contact with Nibbāna. It
is normal for awakened people to regularly be in contact with Nibbāna.
While abiding in ‘fruition attainment’ (<em>phala-samāpatti</em>), noble beings
of all stages fix Nibbāna as their object of awareness.</p>
<p>A passage in the Aṅguttara Nikāya states:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A monk attains the extinction of perception and feeling, and by seeing
with wisdom the taints are destroyed. This is visible Nibbāna
(<em>diṭṭhadhamma-nibbāna</em>) directly (<em>nippariyāya</em>).</p>
<p><em>A. IV. 454-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Here, ‘extinction of perception and feeling’ (<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>)
is not Nibbāna but a basis for which to realize Nibbāna. Nibbāna is
equal to the destruction of the taints.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn193">193</a></sup> Additional suttas state
that the eight <em>vimokkha</em> (note that <em>nirodha-samāpatti</em> is a kind of
<em>vimokkha</em>) are to be realized with the body,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn194">194</a></sup> while the end of the
<em>āsava</em> (a definition of Nibbāna) is to be realized by wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn195">195</a></sup> A
passage in the Saṁyutta Nikāya states:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>For one who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling,
perception and feeling have ceased. For a bhikkhu whose taints are
destroyed, lust, hatred and delusion have ceased.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 217.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Note also that at the Buddha’s Parinibbāna he entered the progressive
abidings of concentrative attainment (<em>anupubbavihāra-samāpatti</em>), from
the first jhāna up to the extinction of perception and feeling, but he
did not enter final Nibbāna in <em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn196">196</a></sup> He gradually
returned to the first jhāna and then entered successive jhānas up to the
fourth jhāna, at which point he attained final Nibbāna.</p>

from purity of moral conduct (<em>sīla-visuddhi</em>) to Nibbāna. Even
feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) can be a form of <em>vimutti</em>, but all these

<p>These five misunderstandings occur easily and many scholars are
guilty of making these mistakes. One remarkable misunderstanding is
that of Mr. Kalupahana, who claims that these two formulas refer to
distinct ways of practice that branch off after a person has
attained the fourth jhāna. He says the second way of practice, from
the base of infinite space to the extinction of perception and
feeling, is equivalent to <em>cetovimutti</em>, while the first way of
practice, i.e. the threefold knowledge (or even the six <em>abhiññā</em>),
is equivalent to <em>paññā-vimutti</em>. He then goes on to say these two
ways of practice lead to <em>aññā</em> – enlightenment. (This is an
example of misunderstanding #4, but also includes the first two
misunderstandings.) See: David J. Kalupahana, ‘Causality: the

<p>The sub-commentaries claim that <em>kalāpa-sammasana</em> is an Indian
term and <em>naya-vipassanā</em> is a Sri Lankan term, but that these two
terms are synonymous (VismṬ.:
Maggāmaggañāṇadassanavisuddhiniddesavaṇṇanā,
Sammasanañāṇakathāvaṇṇanā). They constitute an opposite method to
‘contemplation in order (of a list of factors)’:
<em>anupadadhamma-vipassanā</em>. Ven. Ñāṇamoli translates <em>naya-vipassanā</em>
as ‘inductive insight’ and <em>kalāpa-sammasana</em> as ‘comprehension by
groups’.</p>

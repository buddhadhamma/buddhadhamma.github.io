<p>Although the Buddhist teachings on human conduct and relationships are
diverse and numerous – according to the suitability for different
individuals, communities, and circumstances, and in order to generate
wholesome results at various times and in various places – they all
converge at the same principles and modes of instruction. All of these
teachings encourage people to live and act in harmony with an
interrelated natural system functioning according to natural laws. If we
are able to follow the guidance of awakened individuals conforming to
this natural truth, or if we gain insight into this truth and practise
accordingly, we will reap the desired results.</p>
<p>As the basic theoretical Buddhist teachings, which when realized lead to
genuine satisfaction, are based on a truth connected to an interrelated
natural system, there are additional practical teachings encouraging
people to understand this truth. When realization of this natural truth
occurs, people can use their understanding to engage with things in
order to bring about favourable results, without needing to rely on
teachers or external instruction. This is an inherent part of the
natural system itself.</p>
<p>These two layers of teaching – the theoretical and the practical – are
thus linked and form an integrated body of truth, pertaining directly to
a natural order. ’The One Who Knows’, i.e. the Buddha, simply encouraged
people to give heed to this truth of nature, so that they would realize
it for themselves.</p>
<p>By clearly realizing this natural truth, one is no longer dependent on
the advice and counsel of others. Buddhism thus contains no form of
coercion; it neither forces anyone to believe in the teachings, nor is
it troubled if people reject the teachings. It follows the principle
that all things proceed naturally according to an interrelated system of
causes and conditions. Having realized and discovered this truth for
himself, the Buddha out of kindness and compassion gave instruction and
guidance to others.</p>
<p>This book <em>Buddhadhamma</em> is an attempt to describe the Buddha’s
teachings – which he systematized and set down as standard principles
– on both levels: the basic theoretical teachings on truth and the
practical teachings on personal conduct and social engagement, which are
directly based on the theoretical teachings.</p>
<p>For many years, Khun Yongyut Thanapura has devoted himself to
propagating the Dhamma. Towards the end of 1985, through his own
initiative, he and other faithful lay supporters founded the
Buddhadhamma Foundation. Although this foundation has no direct
affiliation to the book <em>Buddhadhamma</em> or to its author, the
foundation’s name was most likely chosen as a result of their sense of
spiritual connection to this book.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware, from 1992 to the present – for almost
twenty-three years – Khun Yongyut Thanapura has endeavoured to bring
about an English translation of <em>Buddhadhamma</em>. He sponsored this work
unremittingly, until erelong, two translated books were published:
<em>Good, Evil and Beyond: Kamma in the Buddha’s Teaching</em> (translated by
Bruce Evans, January 1993) – a translation of chapter 5 of
<em>Buddhadhamma</em> titled ’Kamma’; and <em>Dependent Origination: The Buddhist
Law of Conditionality</em> (translated by Bruce Evans, 1994) – a
translation of chapter 4 of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> titled ’Paṭiccasamuppāda’.</p>
<p>Khun Yongyut Thanapura, the president of the Buddhadhamma Foundation,
was determined to bring about a complete English translation of
<em>Buddhadhamma</em>, containing all the chapters. Although he met with much
difficulty and obstruction, spending a lot of money and having to wait a
long period of time, he was undaunted and did not give up. The result is
that now, after many years, a complete translated English edition is
ready for publication.</p>
<p>The complete English translation of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> is the work of Mr.
Robin Moore, who has been working on this translation for many years.
Before working with the Buddhadhamma Foundation, while he was still
ordained as a monk named Suriyo Bhikkhu, through his own enthusiasm, he
began to translate these texts and published <em>The Three Signs: Anicca,
Dukkha, and Anattā in the Buddha’s Teachings</em>, a translation of chapter
3 of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> titled ’The Three Characteristics’. On that
occasion, in 2006, Khun Sirichan Bhirombhakdi and her two daughters,
Khun Chuabchan and Khun Pornbhirom Bhirombhakdi, sponsored this
publication for free distribution.</p>
<p>After leaving the monkhood, Mr. Robin Moore continued the translations
of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> under the patronage of Khun Sirichan Bhirombhakdi and
her two daughters, who published the following books for free
distribution: <em>Nibbāna: the Supreme Peace</em> (2009; a compilation of
material drawn primarily from chapters 6, 7 and 10 of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> on
Nibbāna); <em>Dependent Origination</em> (2011; a translation of chapter 4 of
<em>Buddhadhamma</em> titled ’Paṭiccasamuppāda’); and <em>Awakened Beings: True
Disciples of the Buddha</em> (2014; a compilation of material drawn
primarily from chapters 6, 7 and 18 of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> on enlightened
beings). On this occasion it is thus appropriate to express a deep
gratitude to Khun Sirichan Bhirombhakdi and her two daughters for
supporting this translation work and giving the gift of Dhamma by
publishing and distributing the translated editions of <em>Buddhadhamma</em>.
Their efforts have nourished and sustained this translation work until
it was linked with the project sponsored by the Buddhadhamma Foundation,
thus helping to bring about this complete translated edition.</p>
<p>Over more than a decade that Mr. Robin Moore has been working on this
project of translating <em>Buddhadhamma</em>, I am aware that Ven. Ajahn
Jayasaro – through his kindness towards the translator, his love of
Dhamma, and his wish to benefit students of Buddhism – has offered his
assistance, both in terms of his knowledge of Dhamma and his linguistic
skills, to the translator all through to the end. Here, I wish to
acknowledge this kind, able, and virtuous assistance by Ven. Ajahn
Jayasaro.</p>
<p>I wish to congratulate Khun Yongyut Thanapura, both for his individual
efforts and his work as director of the Buddhadhamma Foundation. He has
shown enduring charitableness towards Buddha-Dhamma, and has maintained
fortitude, constancy, and perseverance, braving hardship and difficulty
until the goal of completing the translation of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> has been
achieved. He has played an important part in sustaining Buddhist study
and practice and has spread the blessings stemming from the Dhamma on a
wide scale.</p>
<p>On a similar note, I wish to express gratitude to Mr. Robin Moore, the
translator, whose genuine and faultless efforts have brought this
translation of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> to completion. These efforts have
deservedly generated and radiated goodness and wholesomeness.</p>
<p>The original Thai edition of <em>Buddhadhamma</em> was written as an offering
and dedication to the true Dhamma. As I mentioned in the ’Brief on
Copyright of Translated Material’ (Nov. 9, 2009): ’All of my books are
intended as a gift of the Dhamma, to be printed for free distribution,
for the benefit of the wider public. There are no copyright fees for
these books. If someone appreciates these books and with pure intent
wishes to translate and share them … this is a way to propagate the
Dhamma and perform good deeds for a wider audience. People engaged in
such translations must rely on their skill and proficiency, and expend
much time and energy…. The copyright to these translated works can
thus be considered as belonging to the translator.’ What the translator
then wishes to do with these translated texts is his or her
responsibility to take into further consideration.</p>
<p>I wish to thank everyone who has participated in helping to bring this translated
book into tangible form. May these efforts help to foster goodness
and wellbeing, enhance spiritual development, and generate wisdom for
all human beings, and help to create a stable and true human
civilization.</p>

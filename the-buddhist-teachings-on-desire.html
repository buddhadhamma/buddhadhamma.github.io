<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>People sometimes express the following doubts and criticisms about
Buddhism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>’Buddhism teaches one to abandon craving and to be free from desire.
If people are without desire and don’t seek personal gains and wealth,
how can the nation develop? Buddhism opposes progress.’</em></p>
<p>’Nibbāna is the goal of Buddhism and the practice of Dhamma is for
reaching Nibbāna, but Buddhists should not desire Nibbāna, because if
they do then they have craving and their practice is incorrect. If
people have no desire, how can they practise? Buddhist teachings are
contradictory and they teach to do the impossible.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These doubts and criticisms seem to touch upon the entire scope of the
Buddhist teachings, from the everyday life of householders to the
practice for realizing Nibbāna, from the mundane to the transcendent.
But in fact, they do not have a direct bearing on Buddhism at all. They
stem from a confused understanding, both of human nature and of the
Buddhist teachings.</p>
<p>These misunderstandings are prevalent even amongst Buddhists. They are
connected to matters of language and terminology. In particular, people
have heard that Buddhism teaches one to abandon <em>taṇhā</em> (’craving’),
which is often translated as ’desire’. For whatever reason, they are not
able to distinguish between these various terms and end up equating
craving with desire; they believe that all forms of desire are forms of
craving. Moreover, they believe that Buddhism teaches to abandon all
desire – to be devoid of desire.</p>
<p>Furthermore, other Pali terms with similar connotations may have been
translated in other ways (i.e. not as ’desire’). When the discussion of
desire comes up, people may then forget to refer to these other terms
for comparison.</p>
<p>For a clear understanding of Buddhism, this misunderstanding needs to be
rectified. To begin with, craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) is a form of desire, but not
all desire manifests as craving. There exists a positive form of desire,
which is essential for Dhamma practice and spiritual cultivation.</p>
<p>Before examining this subject in more detail, let us examine some of the
mechanisms of human activity. {972}</p>
<h2 id="mechanisms-of-human-activity"><a class="header" href="#mechanisms-of-human-activity">Mechanisms of Human Activity</a></h2>
<p>One doubt frequently expressed is based on the belief that people’s
actions must always be accompanied by desire; people act according to
desire. If there were no craving or desire as a catalyst, people would
not act. Surely, they would remain inert, listless, and apathetic.</p>
<p>To begin to reply to this doubt, all human actions, even the action to
refrain from acting, requires some movement or activity in the mind. To
be alive entails such movement and activity. Here, we can examine the
mechanisms functioning behind such activity.</p>
<p>Human beings are not like the leaves and branches of trees, which sway
in the breeze, affected solely by external conditions. Humans act
prompted by internal conditions. When the physical body is healthy and
ready for activity, the mind begins to be aware of what lies in front
and behind, above and below, nearby and far away, along with the
surrounding location of various objects. In short, one has an
understanding of the possible avenues for movement and activity.</p>
<p>With this initial understanding, one must then decide which direction to
move and how to act. The mental factor that controls or dictates this
decision-making process is intention (<em>cetanā</em>).</p>
<p>Here, in this process, intention is affected by an impetus or
motivation, which one can call ’desire’. When one desires to go
somewhere, obtain something, or perform an action, intention chooses to
fulfil this desire.</p>
<p>What is desire? On a basic level, desire stems from likes and dislikes.
Whatever agrees with one’s eyes, ears, tongue, mind, etc., one wishes to
obtain and consume. Whatever is disagreeable to the senses one wishes to
escape from or get rid of. Intention makes decisions according to these
likes and dislikes. This form of desire, based on preferences and
aversions, is referred to as ’craving’ (<em>taṇhā</em>).</p>
<p>In sum, there are various factors involved in this activity: knowledge
(<em>paññā</em>; ’intelligence’, ’wisdom’) helps to reveal and discern the
various objects in one’s surrounding environment; craving (<em>taṇhā</em>)
wishes to obtain or get rid of particular objects; and intention
(<em>cetanā</em>) chooses to act according to these desires.</p>
<p>Yet there is another element to this process. Living beings possess
deeper, more fundamental needs and desires when it comes to action or
non-action. They wish to exist, to survive, to be safe, to be healthy
and happy, and to live in an optimal state. They wish to exist in a
state of fulfilment.</p>
<p>Here one may ask whether such fulfilment is found by merely relying on a
knowledge of one’s surrounding sense objects, a craving to either
consume or evade such objects, and an intention which propels actions in
accord with the whispered suggestions by this very craving. {973}</p>
<p>Wisdom itself will answer that this is not enough. If one encounters
some food that has been made to look appetizing by adding various
chemical colorants, craving will want to consume it. But if one indulges
craving, it is as if one drops poison into one’s food and one will
suffer from obesity or some other ailment. This knowledge is
insufficient and untrustworthy. It may claim to be wisdom (<em>paññā</em>), but
in fact it is merely an expression of not-knowing (<em>aññāṇa</em>), i.e. of
ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>).</p>
<p>Take the example of a student:</p>
<p>Counterfeit wisdom may say, ’Not far from here is a place of amusement
and entertainment where one can really be wild and unconstrained.’
Craving, wishing to have fun, then grabs hold of this appealing
prospect. It whispers, ’Don’t go off to school and tax yourself
listening to some tiring subject.’ It then prods intention, which
decides to skip school and engage in some form of excess or debauchery.</p>
<p>When wisdom has been developed as true understanding, besides being
aware of one’s surroundings, one also knows how to bring about goodness,
proficiency, and happiness. One knows what is beneficial and what is
harmful, what to promote and what to avoid. One has an understanding of
causes and effects, knowing that specific actions will have both
short-term and longterm consequences.</p>
<p>In the case of the student, he knows that if he goes off to a place of
vice and indulgence, he will only derive momentary pleasure, but in the
long run his body, his family, and his intelligence will suffer. If, on
the other hand, he perseveres in his studies all aspects of his life
will improve.</p>
<p>Craving acts as the agent, hankering for this and that, while this bogus
wisdom only has a dim understanding of these proceedings. Craving grabs
hold of agreeable aspects and tells intention to seek gratification.
This cycle, however, will never lead to true wellbeing.</p>
<p>When wisdom appears, it knows that following the stream of craving will
lead to eventual danger and affliction, and the mechanism of
ignorance-craving-intention is interrupted or abates.</p>
<p>Wisdom investigates and discerns the interrelationship between things.
It knows, for instance, that happiness is based on good health. It
recognizes that, in order to maintain good health, one should eat
certain foods, exercise, set up a certain environment, maintain certain
daily routines, cultivate the mind, allocate one’s time well, etc.</p>
<p>These things recommended by wisdom are of no interest to craving, which
only seeks personal gratification, delight, ostentation, and
distinction. And anything that is irritating or offensive, it wishes to
escape from or eliminate.</p>
<p>It may appear that without the enticements by craving, there is no
alternative motivating force prompting intention and instigating actions
suggested by one’s understanding of surrounding circumstances. The
functioning of life is impeded.</p>
<p>Yet there exists an alternative motivating force. In this context,
people possess another innate need or desire. In everyday life, however,
sense impressions by way of the five senses (eye, ear, nose, tongue, and
body) tend to stand out. When one encounters a sense impression and
feels either comfort or discomfort, delight or aversion, these feelings
take precedence, leading to liking and disliking. {974} This is the path
of craving. Craving wishes to acquire those things that are agreeable
and to evade or eliminate those things that are disagreeable. Intention
then steers life in this direction. If one leads a shallow or
superficial life, resembling the life of an animal, one may aimlessly
follow the promptings of craving until one’s dying breath.</p>
<p>For human beings, however, who have the potential for excellence and
distinction, craving is not the sole motivating force. As mentioned
above, we possess a more profound need or desire, namely: the desire for
goodness, for a healthy life, for righteousness, for true and lasting
happiness, and for fulfilment and integrity. This wish does not extend
only to ourselves. Whatever one encounters and engages with, one wishes
for that thing to reach its optimal state of completeness. And this wish
is not a detached sentiment; one also wishes to actively help bring
about this fulfilment and completeness.</p>
<p>This alternative motivation, which is inherent in everyone, is referred
to in Pali as <em>chanda</em> (’wholesome desire’, ’wholesome enthusiasm’).</p>
<p>Here, the direction of one’s life changes course. One begins to develop
the quality of one’s life. Wisdom (<em>paññā</em>) discerns what is harmful and
what is beneficial in one’s surroundings, and recognizes the path to
true fulfilment. Wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) aspires to this fulfilment
and wishes to bring it about. And intention (<em>cetanā</em>) initiates the
effort to move in this positive direction.</p>
<p>When people develop themselves in this way, the cycle of
ignorance-craving-intention (<em>avijjā-taṇhā-cetanā</em>) is loosened or
weakened. This cycle may also be referred to as
ignorance-craving-unwholesome action (<em>avijjā-taṇhā-akusala kamma</em>).</p>
<p>It is replaced by the sequence of wisdom – wholesome desire –
intention (<em>paññā</em>-<em>chanda</em>-<em>cetanā</em>), or wisdom – wholesome desire –
wholesome action (<em>paññā</em>-<em>chanda</em>-<em>kusala kamma</em>), which eventually
develops into the way of life of awakened beings.</p>
<p>When true wisdom comes to the fore, counterfeit wisdom (i.e. ignorance)
retreats. Those things recommended by wisdom for promoting health and
wellbeing are likely to be disagreeable in regard to craving. Craving
likes to be indulged by ignorance. When wisdom appears, craving cannot
sustain itself. This is where wholesome desire has an opportunity.</p>
<p>When wisdom points out that true fulfilment is possible, and that
specific things are valuable for one’s life and should be cultivated,
wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>) takes over this matter from wisdom. It
then persuades intention to direct the necessary actions to reach such
fulfilment.</p>
<p>In sum, there are these two distinct kinds of desire: craving (<em>taṇhā</em>)
and wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>).</p>
<p>There is another important element to this process. In the cycle of
ignorance and craving, as soon as a feeling of pleasure or displeasure
arises, along with the desire to obtain or consume, a sense of self
appears to act as the delegate or representative. A ’consumer’ or
’owner’ is born. This then creates the duality between such a consumer
or owner and those objects desired and consumed. (Following on from this
is the arising of a sense of ’you’, of ’him’, ’of them’, etc, who
threaten, obstruct, compete, etc.) {975}</p>
<p>On a deeper level, one wishes for this so-called self to be stable, so
that one can continue to consume things. And one wishes for it to be
powerful, so that one is ensured of obtaining and consuming things to
the greatest degree, without any interference. At the same time, if one
encounters unpleasant, undesirable things, one wishes to escape from or
eliminate them. And if one finds the situation unendurable, one may
react by desiring some form of self-annihilation.</p>
<p>The dual process of wisdom and wholesome desire is the opposite. The
desire for things to exist in the optimal state of goodness and
integrity requires no sense of self to intervene. There is no need for
an owner, a consumer, a desirer, etc. One acts simply in accord with
nature.</p>
<p>To sum up once again, there are these two kinds of desire acting as
motivating forces for people to act:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Craving (<em>taṇhā</em>): the desire to consume and to acquire; the desire
for self-gratification; the desire for oneself to exist or not exist
in some particular way; selfish desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>): the delight in witnessing the
fulfilment and integrity of things; the desire to help bring about
such fulfilment; the desire for things to be complete in themselves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wholesome desire includes the wish for self-fulfilment and
self-integrity. For example, one wishes for one’s body to exist in a
state of good health. In this case, one wishes for the various organs of
the body to exist in their own natural state of wellbeing. (How does
this desire compare with the craving for physical beauty and
attractiveness? This question invites the wise inquiry from
discriminating individuals.)</p>
<h2 id="contrasting-aspects-of-craving-and-wholesome-desire"><a class="header" href="#contrasting-aspects-of-craving-and-wholesome-desire">Contrasting Aspects of Craving and Wholesome Desire</a></h2>
<h3 id="non-action-as-a-form-of-action"><a class="header" href="#non-action-as-a-form-of-action">Non-action as a Form of Action</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, people act according to their knowledge and
understanding, which may simply be at the level of responding to sense
stimuli, or it may develop into true wisdom, which is able to determine
what is appropriate and inappropriate.</p>
<p>In many circumstances, however, instead of initiating an action, people
pause, baulk, or stop short. In this case, the hesitation, passiveness,
or inaction is a form of action, and it may be a potent form of action
at that. As will be explained below, craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) initiates actions
that are prerequisites for acquiring objects of gratification or for
protecting the stability of one’s cherished sense of self. Here, the
term ’action’ includes non-action.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why craving may initiate non-action. For example,
one may refrain from acting because by acting one would be deprived of
some pleasure that one is currently experiencing, or because one would
encounter some kind of trouble or adversity.</p>
<p>Even in the case that acting in a particular way would be truly
beneficial for one’s life, craving may urge one to refrain from acting
out of fear of hardship or deprivation. {976}</p>
<p>When people develop wisdom and generate wholesome desire as a motivating
force, they perform actions they recognize as appropriate and valuable,
even though by acting they will face discomfort and be resisting the
urge by craving to refrain from acting. Conversely, craving may prompt
acting in order to obtain some pleasure, but wisdom, by discerning that
such action will damage one’s quality of life, will urge one to refrain.</p>
<p>When people’s wisdom increases but refined forms of craving remain,
these two qualities become intertwined and profit from one another. The
behaviour of wise individuals is thus more complicated than that of
other people. The important issue here is which factor gains the upper
hand: does craving or wisdom direct proceedings?</p>
<p>If one applies continual wise reflection, wisdom takes the leading role
and becomes increasingly sharper. It ushers in wholesome desire as the
driving force for directing one’s life, to the extent that craving
ceases.</p>
<p>Here one can see that by removing the factor of craving from the
equation, human actions still proceed. Moreover, they are enriched.</p>
<p>Formerly, one relied on craving to help protect the sense of self. Now,
wisdom guides one’s life and paves the way for wholesome desire. As a
consequence, one is released from the clutches of craving.</p>
<h3 id="means-and-ends-craving-as-a-motivating-force"><a class="header" href="#means-and-ends-craving-as-a-motivating-force">Means and Ends: Craving as a Motivating Force</a></h3>
<p>When one gets to the heart of the matter, one recognizes that craving
(<em>taṇhā</em>) in fact is not a genuine motivation for action, because the
act itself is not the priority for craving.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, craving desires to consume and acquire things that
provide one with pleasure. Wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>), on the other
hand, wishes for true completion and fulfilment of all things with which
one engages. This dichotomy provides for complexity in regard to action
and non-action.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Sarah is endowed with wholesome enthusiasm. She sees the interior of a
house and wants it to be clean (she wishes for this dwelling to exist in
a state of completeness). If it is dirty, she wishes for it to be clean
and picks up a broom to sweep the floor. She derives joy and contentment
both from sweeping (which is the cause for the desired result) and from
witnessing a clean space (which is the direct result from sweeping).</p>
<p>Harry has no interest or delight in cleanliness, but he does have a
sweet tooth. His mother suggests that he helps with the chores, but he
doesn’t respond. She thus says, ’If you sweep the house, I will buy you
some sweets.’ When he hears this, Harry picks up a broom and sweeps. In
fact, Harry does not desire cleanliness. He only sweeps because this
action is a means by which he can get some candy.</p>
<p>Harry derives no pleasure from sweeping (he may even find it irritating)
and he is not determined to do a good job (his mother may need to
constantly supervise him). This is because sweeping is the cause for a
clean house, which is not the result he desires. {977} His happiness
will have to wait until he gets the sweets.</p>
<p>To reiterate, craving does not desire the thing or state that is the
direct result of an action. Craving urges action only in the case when
it is a necessary prerequisite for obtaining desired objects. If there
is another way to obtain the desired objects without needing to make
effort, craving will prompt one to avoid acting and choose the path of
inaction instead. Craving is more often a motivation for <em>inaction</em> than
it is for action.</p>
<p>When craving leads to an avoidance of action, it may manifest in the
form of laziness, whereby one clings to pleasurable sensations.
Alternatively, it may manifest in the form of fear, say by being afraid
of encountering some form of discomfort while performing an action or
being anxious of losing self-importance.</p>
<p>When inaction is needed for craving to get what it wants, that is,
increased sensual pleasure or reinforced self-importance, craving urges
such inaction, without considering whether positive effects derived from
acting may be forfeited.</p>
<p>Here are more examples: a child refuses to go to school because he knows
that his mother will then increase his allowance for sweets (this is a
clear case of inaction being a potent form of action); a man finishes
work early in order to drink alcohol and gamble; someone receives a
bribe in order to refrain from work that should be done; out of
laziness, one pays someone else to do some tasks that one should attend
to oneself. In this case, one forfeits the satisfaction and delight that
is connected to the fruits of one’s own labour.</p>
<p>Positive action is initiated by wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) stemming
from wisdom, which recognizes what is truly valuable and what should be
done. Wisdom rouses wholesome desire for bringing these things to
completion.</p>
<p>Even in the case when craving initiates action, there are perils,
because the preconditions mentioned earlier establish the following
equation: craving urges action out of delight for the pleasure derived
from such action. The more one acts the more pleasure one receives; the
more pleasure there is the more one desires; the more one desires the
more one acts. In many occasions people keep acting until the positive
results of these actions are squandered.</p>
<p>Wholesome desire, on the other hand, initiates action out of delight for
its positive and wholesome effects. The more one acts the more these
positive effects increase and the more delight one experiences; the more
delight one has the more one acts. One continues acting until the
goodness and integrity reaches completion. The action fully corresponds
with its objective.</p>
<p>In sum, craving more often than not urges inaction, and even when it
initiates action, these actions are hazardous and lead to more harmful
effects than beneficial ones. One should thus abandon craving and,
instead, foster wisdom and cultivate wholesome desire. {978}</p>

<h3 id="linguistic-analysis-of-the-term-chanda"><a class="header" href="#linguistic-analysis-of-the-term-chanda">Linguistic Analysis of the Term Chanda</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the confusion surrounding the meaning of desire,
which is viewed in an overly restrictive sense by associating all desire
with craving, stems from an erroneous and inadequate understanding of
some key Pali terms.</p>
<p>There are many Pali terms denoting desire, and some of these terms are
complex both in terms of their definitions and how they are used in
speech and writing. This complexity invites confusion.</p>
<p>First, let us distinguish and clarify some of these difficult terms.</p>
<p>The Pali word which is used in both a general sense, covering the entire
spectrum of desire, and in a technical sense, referring specifically to
wholesome desire, is <em>chanda</em>.</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> may be translated in many different ways, including: will,
desire, delight, enthusiasm, zeal, contentment, satisfaction,
aspiration, yearning, wish, love, and passion. At this point, let us
simply refer to it as ’desire’.</p>
<p>Drawing from different sources, the commentaries mention three kinds of
desire (<em>chanda</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1-1"><a href="#fn-fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Taṇhā-chanda</em>: desire as craving (<em>taṇhā</em>); unwholesome desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kattukamyatā-chanda</em>: the desire to act; the wish to act.
Occasionally, this term is used in a neutral sense, applicable to
both wholesome and unwholesome contexts, but generally it is used in
a positive, wholesome sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kusaladhamma-chanda</em>: desire for virtuous qualities; wholesome
desire for truth. It is often abbreviated to <em>kusala-chanda</em> (love
of virtue; aspiration for goodness) or <em>dhamma-chanda</em> (love of
truth; aspiration for truth).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Taṇhā-chanda:</strong><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn2-1"><a href="#fn-fn2">2</a></sup> the term <em>chanda</em> in this context is a synonym for
craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), in the same way as the terms <em>rāga</em> (’lust’) and
<em>lobha</em> (’greed’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn3-1"><a href="#fn-fn3">3</a></sup> This form of <em>chanda</em> is found frequently in the
Pali Canon, including in the term <em>kāma-chanda</em> (’sensual desire’),
which is the first of the five hindrances (<em>nīvaraṇa</em>) and is equivalent
to <em>kāma-taṇhā</em> (’craving for sensuality’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn4-1"><a href="#fn-fn4">4</a></sup> {979} <em>Chanda</em> in this
context is usually used on its own, but sometimes it is used together
with synonyms, for example in this passage by the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>With the relinquishment of desire (<em>chanda</em>), lust (<em>rāga</em>), delight
(<em>nandi</em>), craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), and clinging (<em>upādāna</em>) … regarding
the eye, forms, eye-consciousness, and things cognizable through
eye-consciousness, I have understood that my mind is liberated. (This
passage refers to all six sense bases.) (See
Note <a href="#note-synonyms">Synonyms of Desire</a>)</p>
<p><em>M. III. 32.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Because <em>chanda</em> in this context is identical to <em>taṇhā</em>, it is possible
to replace the term <em>chanda</em> with the term <em>taṇhā</em> in the following
passages: ’a desire for existence’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn5-1"><a href="#fn-fn5">5</a></sup> ’a desire for sense
pleasures’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn6-1"><a href="#fn-fn6">6</a></sup> ’delight for the body’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn7-1"><a href="#fn-fn7">7</a></sup> ’love of sexual
intercourse’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn8-1"><a href="#fn-fn8">8</a></sup> ’delight in the body and feelings, which are
impermanent, unsatisfactory, and insubstantial’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn9-1"><a href="#fn-fn9">9</a></sup> and ’desire for
sounds, smells and tastes, which are impermanent, unsatisfactory, and
insubstantial’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn10-1"><a href="#fn-fn10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Compound words are created with <em>chanda</em> in a similar way to <em>taṇhā</em>,
for example: <em>rūpa-chanda</em> (’delight in forms’), <em>sadda-chanda</em>
(’delight in sounds’), <em>gandha-chanda</em> (’delight in smells’),
<em>rasa-chanda</em> (’delight in tastes’), <em>phoṭṭhabba-chanda</em> (’delight in
tactile objects’), and <em>dhamma-chanda</em> (’delight in mental
objects’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn11-1"><a href="#fn-fn11">11</a></sup> <em>Chanda</em> can be used in the context of human
relationships,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn12-1"><a href="#fn-fn12">12</a></sup> referring to love or affection, as is seen in the
Gandhabhaga Sutta, where it refers to love for one’s wife and
children.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn13-1"><a href="#fn-fn13">13</a></sup> In this same sutta it states: ’<em>Chanda</em> is the root of
suffering,’ in the same manner as the second noble truth, which states
that craving is the cause for suffering. In another sutta the Buddha
says that one should abandon <em>chanda</em> (for things that are impermanent,
<em>dukkha</em>, and not-self),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn14-1"><a href="#fn-fn14">14</a></sup> in the same way that in the
Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta he says that one should abandon craving.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn15-1"><a href="#fn-fn15">15</a></sup></p>
<div class="note">

<blockquote>
<p>The commentaries generally classify <em>chanda</em>, <em>rāga</em>, <em>nandi</em>, and
<em>taṇhā</em> as synonyms for one another, but in some necessary cases a
distinction is made according to the intensity of desire.</p>
<p>For example, <em>chanda</em> is described as a weak form of <em>taṇhā</em> or a weak
form of <em>rāga</em>, but when it arises frequently it becomes an intense
form of craving or greed.</p>
<p>Similarly, <em>chanda</em> is a weak form of <em>lobha</em>, but when desire
intensifies and leads to infatuation, it is classified as <em>rāga</em>, and
when it further intensifies it becomes acute greed (<em>chanda-rāga</em>).</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Kattukamyatā-chanda:</strong> the desire to act. This form of desire is
equivalent to the group of mental factors (<em>cetasika</em>) classified in the
Abhidhamma as ’miscellaneous’ or ’apportioned’ (<em>pakiṇṇaka-cetasika</em>),
that is, they can arise in both a wholesome mind state and in an
unwholesome mind state.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn16-1"><a href="#fn-fn16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The <em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em> most familiar to students of Buddhism is the
desire or enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>) classified as the first factor in the
Four Paths to Success (<em>iddhi-pāda</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn17-1"><a href="#fn-fn17">17</a></sup> and which is also the
essential quality in the Four Right Efforts (<em>sammappadhāna</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn18-1"><a href="#fn-fn18">18</a></sup> The
meaning of <em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em> is very similar to the meaning of
<em>viriya</em> (’energy’), <em>vāyāma</em> (’effort’), and <em>ussāha</em> (’endeavour’).
{980} These terms are occasionally used together to complement each
other.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn19-1"><a href="#fn-fn19">19</a></sup> This form of desire is considered an essential factor in
Dhamma practice.</p>
<p>The commentaries tend to include this form of desire in the third form,
of <em>kusaladhamma-chanda</em>, as if they are one and the same. For example,
the desire in the Four Paths to Success and in the Four Right Efforts is
classified as both <em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em> and <em>kusaladhamma-chanda.</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn20-1"><a href="#fn-fn20">20</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Kusaladhamma-chanda:</strong> this form of desire is mentioned in one sutta,
in which it is the final factor in a list describing the six things that
are difficult to encounter in the world.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn21-1"><a href="#fn-fn21">21</a></sup> It is considered an
essential factor for people in order to benefit from the Buddhist
teachings or to lead a virtuous life, because although one may have
encountered the first five factors, if one lacks a desire for wholesome
qualities one will not be able to truly benefit from these other
factors:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, the appearance of six things is rare in the world. What six?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The appearance of a perfectly enlightened Buddha is rare in the
world;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the appearance of one who teaches the Dhamma proclaimed by the
Buddha is rare in the world;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to be reborn in the land of the noble ones is rare in the world;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the possession of unimpaired physical and mental faculties is rare
in the world;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the absence of foolishness and dimwittedness is rare in the world;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a desire for wholesome qualities is rare in the world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The <em>chanda</em> most frequently referred to in the context of Dhamma
practice is desire and enthusiasm as found in the teaching on the Four
Right Efforts (<em>sammappadhāna</em>; ’complete effort’):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>That person generates desire for the nonarising of unarisen evil
unwholesome states; he makes an effort, arouses energy, raises up the
mind, and perseveres. He generates desire for the abandoning of arisen
evil unwholesome states … for the arising of unarisen wholesome
states … for the maintenance of arisen wholesome states, for their
non-decline, increase, expansion, fulfilment, and development.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This passage is considered a definition of the Four Right Efforts. Here,
wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) is designated as the essence or principal
ingredient of effort (<em>viriya</em>), which is included in the thirty-seven
factors of enlightenment (<em>bodhipakkhiya-dhamma</em>).</p>
<p>The term <em>chanda</em> in other passages related to Dhamma practice has a
similar meaning, for example: the desire to fulfil all wholesome
qualities,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn22-1"><a href="#fn-fn22">22</a></sup> the desire to undertake training,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn23-1"><a href="#fn-fn23">23</a></sup> the desire to
develop the faculty of wisdom,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn24-1"><a href="#fn-fn24">24</a></sup> the desire to abandon all mental
impurities,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn25-1"><a href="#fn-fn25">25</a></sup> and the desire for Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn26-1"><a href="#fn-fn26">26</a></sup> {981}</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> in these cases should be interpreted as both
<em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em> and <em>kusaladhamma-chanda</em>: as both the desire to
act and the desire for virtuous qualities, or in brief: the desire to do
good.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn27-1"><a href="#fn-fn27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>The Vibhaṅga of the Abhidhamma defines <em>chanda</em> in the Four Right
Efforts and in the Four Paths to Success as
<em>kattukamyatā-kusaladhamma-chanda</em>:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn28-1"><a href="#fn-fn28">28</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Four Right Efforts: In the phrase ’generate chanda’, how is
chanda interpreted? Whichever delight, aspiration, desire to act, or
wholesome love of truth there is is called chanda.</p>
<p><em>Chandaṁ janetīti tatha katamo chando? Yo chando chandikatā
kattukamyatā kusalo dhammachando ayaṁ vuccati chando.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Four Paths to Success: In the Four Paths to Success what is the
path to success of aspiration (chanda-iddhipāda)? At whichever time
a monk in this Dhamma and Discipline cultivates the transcendent
jhānas (lokuttara-jhāna) … the delight, aspiration, desire to act,
or wholesome love of truth at that time is called chanda.</p>
<p><em>Tattha katamo chandiddhipādo? idha bhikkhu yasmiṁ samaye lokuttaraṁ
jhānaṁ bhāveti … yo tasmiṁ samaye chando chandikatā kattukamyatā
kusalo dhammachando ayaṁ vuccati chandiddhipādo.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This definition in the Vibhaṅga is the basis for later commentarial
interpretations of <em>chanda</em> as a distinctively wholesome quality and is
most likely the origin of the convention of combining
<em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em> with <em>kusaladhamma-chanda</em> into a single factor.</p>
<h3 id="chanda-as-the-root-of-suffering-and-chanda-as-the-source-of-wholesome-qualities"><a class="header" href="#chanda-as-the-root-of-suffering-and-chanda-as-the-source-of-wholesome-qualities">Chanda as the Root of Suffering and Chanda as the Source of Wholesome Qualities</a></h3>
<p>The Buddha used the single compound term <em>chanda-mūlaka</em> in different
contexts, sometimes with opposite meanings: in one case it may refer to
a wholesome quality and in another case to an unwholesome quality. It is
useful here to examine this discrepancy.</p>
<p>The term <em>chanda-mūlaka</em> means having desire as the root, source, or
point of origin. In one context the Buddha states that all forms of
suffering have desire as the root, whereas in another context he states
that all things have desire as the root. {982}</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Desire as the root of suffering and of the five aggregates of
clinging:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Headman, this matter can be understood in this way: ’Whatever
suffering arises, all that arises rooted in desire, with desire as its
source; for desire (chanda) is the root of suffering.’</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 329-30.</em></p>
<p>That bhikkhu delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s statement.
Then he asked the Blessed One a further question: ’But, venerable sir,
in what are these five aggregates subject to clinging rooted?’ ’These
five aggregates subject to clinging, bhikkhu, are rooted in desire
(chanda).’</p>
<p><em>M. III. 16; S. III. 100-101.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These two passages correspond with one another, as confirmed by the
Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta, in which the Buddha states:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’In brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.’</p>
<p><em>S. V. 421.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>All of the commentarial and sub-commentarial explanations of the second
passage (on the five aggregates of clinging) are consistent, stating
that ’rooted in desire’ means ’rooted in craving (<em>taṇhā</em>)’ or ’rooted
in covetous desire (<em>taṇhā-chanda</em>)’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn29-1"><a href="#fn-fn29">29</a></sup> These texts occasionally
confirm that these explanations are consistent with crav-ing (<em>taṇhā</em>)
being denoted as the origin of suffering (<em>dukkha-samudaya</em>).</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Desire as the root of all things:</p>
<p>The Buddha uttered these words: <em>Chandamūlakā … sabbe dhammā</em>, which
may be rendered as ’all things are rooted in desire’, ’all things are
based on desire’, or ’all things have desire as their source’.</p>
<p>This key phrase by the Buddha is contained in a longer passage, which
can be considered a compilation of ten major Buddhist principles. It
contains important principles of Dhamma practice and culminates in the
highest goal of Buddhism:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, if wanderers of other sects should ask you: ’What, friends, are
all things rooted in? … What is their culmination?’ you should
answer them as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All things are rooted in desire<br />
(<em>chandamūlakā … sabbe dhammā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things have attention as their source<br />
(<em>manasikāra-sambhavā sabbe dhammā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things originate from contact<br />
(<em>phassa-samudayā sabbe dhammā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things converge upon feeling<br />
(<em>vedanā-samosaraṇā sabbe dhammā</em>). {983}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things are headed by concentration<br />
(<em>samādhippamukhā sabbe dhammā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things have mindfulness as their sovereign<br />
(<em>satādhipateyyā sabbe dhammā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things have wisdom as their pinnacle<br />
(<em>paññuttarā sabbe dhammā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things have liberation as their essence<br />
(<em>vimutti-sārā sabbe dhammā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things merge into the deathless<br />
(<em>amatogadhā sabbe dhammā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All things culminate in Nibbāna<br />
(<em>nibbāna-pariyosānā sabbe dhammā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn30-1"><a href="#fn-fn30">30</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. V. 106-107.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are asked thus, monks, it is in such a way that you should
answer those wanderers of other sects.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>It is clear that all of these factors are vital in Buddhist practice.
Together, they constitute the cultivation of wholesomeness up to the
final goal of Buddhism, and these factors are thus all wholesome in
themselves. At the very least, they are neutral factors, which may be
incorporated in this wholesome framework. For this reason, the term
’desire’ (<em>chanda</em>) here definitely does not refer to an unwholesome
quality.</p>
<p>The commentaries explain that ’all things’ (<em>sabbe dhammā</em>) here refers
to the five aggregates, i.e. to all conditioned phenomena
(<em>saṅkhata-dhammā</em>). (Nibbāna is excluded here as it is the cessation of
all conditioned phenomena.)</p>
<p>Note that in the previous section (above) the five aggregates of
clinging (<em>upādāna-khandha</em>) are said to be rooted in desire, and that
this desire is equated with craving (<em>taṇhā</em>). Here, however, the five
aggregates (i.e. not as a basis for clinging) are mentioned.</p>
<p>How do the five aggregates and the five aggregates of clinging differ
from one another? The Buddha said that in the case that the five
aggregates are a supportive condition for the mental taints (<em>sāsava</em>)
and for clinging (<em>upādāniya</em>), they constitute the five aggregates of
clinging. If they are free from the taints and from clinging they are
the five aggregates in a sheer or absolute sense.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn31-1"><a href="#fn-fn31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>Many sub-commentarial passages explaining these ten factors explicitly
state that wholesome qualities are rooted in desire (<em>chandamūlakā
kusalā dhammā</em>): wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) is the source of wholesome
things. One of these passages defines this desire specifically as the
’desire to act’ (<em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em>), which incorporates the desire
for virtuous qualities (<em>kusaladhamma-chanda</em>; this includes the love of
goodness – <em>kusala-chanda</em> – and the love of truth –
<em>dhamma-chanda</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn32-1"><a href="#fn-fn32">32</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="definitive-definition-for-chanda"><a class="header" href="#definitive-definition-for-chanda">Definitive Definition for Chanda</a></h3>
<p>When we have considered the various definitions of the term <em>chanda</em> and
thoroughly examined the divergent passages in which it is used, we are
prepared to establish a definitive definition for this term. By relying
on a mutual understanding of this term we can establish a standard
definition for it in the context of Dhamma study.</p>
<p>In brief, the term <em>chanda</em> encompasses all forms of human desire. {984}</p>
<p>Unwholesome, negative <em>chanda</em> is equivalent to the term <em>taṇhā</em>.
Because the term <em>taṇhā</em> is familiar to most students of Buddhism,
negative desire may be replaced by this term.</p>
<p>Virtuous, wholesome <em>chanda</em> is called <em>kusaladhamma-chanda</em>; it is
sometimes abbreviated to <em>kusala-chanda</em> or <em>dhamma-chanda</em>. As negative
desire may be referred to as <em>taṇhā</em>, it is simple and convenient to
refer to wholesome desire by the single term <em>chanda</em>.</p>
<p><em>Kattukamyatā-chanda</em> (’the desire to act’) is a neutral form of desire.
In most cases this term is used in a positive sense, referring to the
desire for virtuous qualities (<em>kusaladhamma-chanda</em>). Therefore, it too
may be incorporated into the single term <em>chanda</em>.</p>
<p>Here we can determine to simplify matters by using just these two terms
to refer to human desire and motivation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Taṇhā</em>: unwholesome desire (the desire to consume, to acquire, and
to obtain).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Chanda</em>: wholesome desire (the desire to act; the desire to bring
about integrity and fulfilment).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can feel at ease by making this simple distinction, because it
accords with an identical distinction made in the commentaries and later
texts.</p>
<p>In many of the texts, when there is a passage relevant to the subject of
unwholesome and wholesome desire, an analysis of these qualities is
provided. Although this analysis is not always comprehensive, it is
clear that the authors of these texts wished to point out the difference
between these two kinds of desire. (Note that there is no single passage
in which the three aforementioned kinds of desire are clearly listed
together.)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn33-1"><a href="#fn-fn33">33</a></sup> Occasionally, a pair of clearly defined terms is used;
the most common distinction is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Taṇhā-chanda</em>: desire as craving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kattukamyatā-chanda</em>: the desire to act.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two commentarial texts which present a clear account of these
principles dealing with desire. In the Papañcasūdanī and the
Paramatthadīpanī, ’desire’ (here, the Pali term <em>patthanā</em> is used) may
be classified into two kinds:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn34-1"><a href="#fn-fn34">34</a></sup> (See

<blockquote>
<p>These commentaries refer to examples from the Pali Canon. In the
Buddha’s teaching: <em>For him who still desires, there is obsessive
desiring and agitation about those things on which he fixes his
attention</em> (Sn. 176), the desire referred to is craving (<em>taṇhā</em>).</p>
<p>In the teaching: <em>I have cut off, destroyed, and cleared the stream of
Māra the wicked one; you should greatly rejoice and desire true
safety</em> (M. I. 227), the desire referred to is <em>chanda</em>, which is a
wholesome quality of desiring to act.</p>
<p>The commentaries also refer to this passage: <em>A bhikkhu who is in
higher training</em> (<em>sekha</em>)<em>, who has not yet reached the fruit of
arahantship, and who is still desiring the supreme security from
bondage</em> (M. I. 4). Here too, ’desire’ refers to <em>chanda</em> as a
wholesome quality.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These commentarial explanations support the classification of desire
into two distinct kinds. {985}</p>
<h2 id="craving-and-wholesome-desire"><a class="header" href="#craving-and-wholesome-desire">Craving and Wholesome Desire</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned just above, there are two main motivating forces prompting
human beings to act:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Taṇhā</em>: pleasure, delight, desire, lust, and longing that is
unwholesome, unhealthy, and unsupportive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Chanda</em>: pleasure, delight, desire, love, and aspiration that is
wholesome, healthy, and supportive.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="motivation-of-craving"><a class="header" href="#motivation-of-craving">Motivation of Craving</a></h3>
<p><em>Taṇhā</em> may be translated as ’thirst’, ’craving’, ’yearning’,
’infatuation’, ’fervour’, ’lust’, ’agitation’, ’anxiety’, or
’insatiability’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn35-1"><a href="#fn-fn35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the teaching of Dependent Origination, <em>taṇhā</em> is
conditioned by feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) and rooted in ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>).
When one receives a pleasurable or displeasurable sense impression –
one sees a delightful or loathsome visual form, for example, or hears a
melodious or grating sound – and feels either pleasure, pain, or a
neutral feeling, craving arises in one form or another. If one
experiences pleasure, then one is glad, delighted, satisfied,
fascinated, enthralled, and covetous. If one feels pain, then one is
displeased, dissatisfied, and averse, and one wishes to escape or wishes
for the feeling to disappear. If one feels a neutral feeling then one
remains indifferent and complacent.</p>
<p>These reactions occur automatically; they require no thinking or
understanding. (On the contrary, if a person reflects on or understands
the process, for example if one knows that the loathsome visual object
is beneficial or the melodious sound is in fact an alarm signalling
danger, or one is aware that the object is unsuitable on the grounds of
ethical or cultural considerations, then craving can be severed and the
habitual process can be replaced by a new form of behaviour.) Craving is
dependent on feeling and is reinforced by ignorance: it ’rests upon’
feeling and is grounded in ignorance.</p>
<p>Because craving is directly tied up with feeling, a person with craving
searches for things that will provide pleasing, delightful feelings.
There are six distinct things that can provide feeling: visual forms,
sounds, smells, tastes, tactile objects, and mental objects.</p>
<p>The first five – sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile objects –
are connected to the material world and are particularly pronounced.
They are referred to as the five objects of sensual enjoyment
(<em>kāma-guṇa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn36-1"><a href="#fn-fn36">36</a></sup> The six sense objects, and especially the five
objects of sensual enjoyment, are both the aim and the source of
craving. Craving is thus a thirst for things that provide sensation and
a thirst for pleasing sense objects – a desire for pleasing sense
objects in order to experience delightful feelings. (See
Note <a href="#note-craving-senses">Craving Arising and Ceasing</a>) In brief, craving is the desire to
acquire. {986}</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Craving Arising and Ceasing</span><a id="note-craving-senses"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To say that craving arises from the six sense objects or from the five
cords of sensual pleasure is a concise explanation. A detailed
explanation by the Buddha is that craving arises from things that are
pleasurable (<em>piya-rūpa</em>) and agreeable (<em>sāta-rūpa</em>), of which there
are ten groups of six items: the six internal sense organs, the six
external sense objects, the six forms of consciousness, the six kinds
of contact, the six kinds of feeling, the six kinds of perception, the
six kinds of volition, the six kinds of craving, the six kinds of
applied thought (<em>vitakka</em>), and the six kinds of sustained thought
(<em>vicāra</em>). Craving is both established at these pleasurable and
agreeable things and abandoned and ceases at these things.</p>
<p><em>D. II. 308-311; S. II. 108-109; Ps. I. 39-40; Vbh. 101-103.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Craving has further repercussions: the experience of contacting sense
objects and experiencing feelings gives rise to a mistaken belief that
there is a stable, lasting self that experiences these feelings.</p>
<p>Accompanying this belief in a stable, lasting self is a craving for this
self to endure. But this biased belief is merely an idea (that is, it is
not based in reality), and it tends to generate an opposing belief that
inclines in the opposite direction, that the self exists only
temporarily, that it is impermanent and will eventually disappear.</p>
<p>These beliefs are connected to the feelings resulting from contact with
sense objects: the existence of a self is defined and determined by the
experience of pleasant feelings. When a person is gratified by sense
contact, the craving for the stability of the self is intensified. But
when the person is not gratified by sense contact then the stability of
the self loses significance. If the dissatisfaction with sense contact
is strong then there arises an aversion for the stability of the ’self’:
a person wishes for the self to be separated from the present state of
existence or craves for the destruction of the self. This alternative
form of craving – for annihilation of the self – goes hand in hand
with the belief that the self exists temporarily and will eventually
disappear.</p>
<p>These two forms of craving – for stability of the self and for
self-annihilation – exist as a pair and lie in juxtaposition to one
another.</p>
<p>The first kind of craving – a desire for pleasant sense objects – is
also a desire for sense objects to satisfy the ’self’ or a desire for
the self to experience pleasant feeling from sense objects.</p>
<p>All forms of craving merge at or serve a sense of self.</p>
<p>People allow these different forms of craving to direct the course of
life, by pandering to them, nourishing them, and faithfully obeying
them. They are the source of all problems, both personal and social, and
they generate expectation, fear, doubt, anger, hostility, carelessness,
obsession, and conflict. There are three distinct kinds of craving:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Kāma-taṇhā</em>: craving for pleasant sense objects to satisfy a sense
of self; craving for sensuality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhava-taṇhā</em>: craving for the importance, stability, and
immortality of the self; craving for existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vibhava-taṇhā</em>: craving for the destruction, escape, or
annihilation of the self; craving for non-existence. {987}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In brief, these three kinds of craving may be referred to as craving for
sense pleasure, craving for existence, and craving for
non-existence.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn37-1"><a href="#fn-fn37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the Buddhist teaching on the mode of conditionality
(<em>paccayākāra</em>), craving leads to ’seeking’ (<em>pariyesanā</em> or <em>esanā</em>,
see
Note <a href="#note-craving-seeking">Craving and Seeking</a>): the search to obtain desired
objects, which results in acquisition. The acquisition of a desired
object marks the end of one stage in the conditional process.</p>
<p>Before examining this process more closely, take note that seeking is
not the same as doing, and seeking may not involve any form of physical
action, as will be discussed below.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Craving and Seeking</span><a id="note-craving-seeking"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Taṇhaṁ paṭicca pariyesanā</em>: ’with craving as condition, there is
seeking’; <em>pariyesanaṁ paṭicca lābho</em>: ’with seeking as condition,
there is acquisition.’</p>
<p>(D. II. 58-9; A. IV. 400-401; Vbh. 390-1; cf.: S. II. 143 where
craving is expressed as the term <em>chanda</em>).</p>
<p><em>Pariyesanā</em> can also be translated as ’endeavouring to obtain’ or
’acknowledging’.</p>
<p>At DA. II. 499, AA. IV. 188 and VinṬ.: Parivāraṭīkā, Ekuttarikanayo,
Navakavāravaṇṇanā <em>taṇhā</em> is classified as two kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>esanā-taṇhā</em> (craving in the search for desired objects) and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>esita-taṇhā</em> (craving for things sought after and acquired).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nd. I. 262 and DA. III. 720 mention five kinds of <em>chanda</em>:</p>

<li>
<p>desire in searching (<em>pariyesana-chanda</em>),</p>

<p>desire in accumulation (<em>sannidhi-chanda</em>), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>desire in distributing (<em>visajjana-chanda</em>: to hand out money or
feed people to increase one’s following);</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These two passages explain that these five kinds of <em>chanda</em> are all
expressions of <em>taṇhā</em>.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="motivation-of-wholesome-desire"><a class="header" href="#motivation-of-wholesome-desire">Motivation of Wholesome Desire</a></h3>
<p>At this point let us return to the term <em>chanda</em>, which we have defined
as desire for wholesome qualities (<em>kusaladhamma-chanda</em>), love of
virtue (<em>kusala-chanda</em>), or love of truth (<em>dhamma-chanda</em>).</p>
<p><em>Kusaladhamma-chanda</em> is translated as desire for wholesome qualities:
an enthusiasm for and delight in virtue.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn38-1"><a href="#fn-fn38">38</a></sup> <em>Kusala-chanda</em> is
translated as love of virtue; although the term <em>dhamma</em> is removed,
<em>kusala-chanda</em> has an identical meaning to <em>kusaladhamma-chanda</em>.</p>
<p><em>Kusala</em> may be translated as ’wholesome’, ’skilful’, ’favourable’,
’proficient’, ’healthy’, or ’salubrious’: it refers to things that are
beneficial to a person’s life, things that promote wellness and
prosperity for an individual and for society. (See
Note <a href="#note-def-kusala">Definitions of Kusala</a>) {988}</p>
<p><em>Dhamma-chanda</em> is translated as love of truth or a desire for truth.
The term <em>dhamma</em> often has a general meaning, referring to ’thing’ or
’teaching’, but in this context its meaning is more far-reaching.</p>
<p>Here, <em>dhamma</em> has two principal meanings: first, the ’truth’ (or
teachings that reveal the truth), and second, ’virtue’ (’goodness’,
’virtuous quality’, and to some extent ’ethics’). <em>Dhamma-chanda</em> can
thus be rendered as ’love of truth’, ’love of virtue’, ’desire for
truth’, or ’desire for virtue’.</p>
<p>The desire for truth points also towards knowledge: a person wants to
know the truth, to realize the truth, to realize the true meaning, true
essence, and true value of things.</p>
<p>And the desire for virtue is linked to action: a person wishes to
generate goodness.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Definitions of Kusala</span><a id="note-def-kusala"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three principal definitions for <em>kusala</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>ārogya</em> (an absence of illness; healthy);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>anavajja</em> (faultless); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>kosalla-sambhūta</em> (arising from skilfulness; arising from
wisdom).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternative definitions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>’resulting in happiness’ (<em>sukha-vipāka</em>) and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’peaceful’ (<em>khema</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>See, e.g.: PsA. I. 129, 206; DhsA. 38, 62; DA. II. 645; VismṬ.:

</blockquote>
</div>
<p><em>Dhamma-chanda</em> can therefore be translated as ’intent on truth’, ’love
of truth’, ’intent on goodness’, or ’love of goodness’. It includes an
aspiration for knowledge, a desire to act, an eagerness to act. A simple
definition for <em>dhamma-chanda</em> is ’intent on truth’, with the
understanding that all the aforementioned explanations are included in
this definition. In a similar fashion, the term <em>chanda</em> on its own can
also be translated as ’intent on truth’.</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> desires truth and virtue; it desires a knowledge of truth; it
desires to act in order to give rise to goodness and to produce truly
beneficial results. <em>Chanda</em> is thus related to action, specifically
action performed in order to know the truth and to create goodness.</p>
<p>Why is it that when wholesome desire (<em>kusaladhamma-chanda</em>) is
mentioned in the texts, it is usually linked to the desire to act
(<em>kattukamyatā</em>)? The desire for knowledge and goodness solicits action.
In order to arrive at knowledge, truth, and fulfilment, one must act. To
use a play on words, to access the real one must have zeal.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn39-1"><a href="#fn-fn39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>For this reason, the desire to act is an attribute of wholesome desire
or the love of truth. One can even say that the term <em>chanda</em> is a
synonym for <em>kattukamyatā</em>: the desire to act is wholesome desire.
Sooner or later, when the texts mention wholesome desire
(<em>kusala-chanda</em>) or the love of truth (<em>dhamma-chanda</em>), they normally
conclude by stating that <em>chanda</em> is equivalent to the desire to act
(<em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em>).</p>
<p>In reference to the mode of conditionality (<em>paccayākāra</em>), the Buddha
said that <em>chanda</em> leads to perseverance (<em>ussāha</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn40-1"><a href="#fn-fn40">40</a></sup> or he
mentioned <em>chanda</em> as preceding effort (<em>vāyāma</em>) or energy
(<em>viriya</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn41-1"><a href="#fn-fn41">41</a></sup> Put simply, <em>chanda</em> generates action (just as <em>taṇhā</em>
generates seeking).</p>
<p>Related to this subject, the commentaries say that the cause of
wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) is wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn42-1"><a href="#fn-fn42">42</a></sup></p>
<p>This passage indicates that wholesome desire is part of a conditional
process involving wisdom. Wholesome desire commences when a person
begins to apply wisdom (just as the arising of craving depends on
ignorance). {989}</p>
<h3 id="comparative-analysis"><a class="header" href="#comparative-analysis">Comparative Analysis</a></h3>
<p>To sum up:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) is focused on feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) and desires
objects in order to experience feeling, or desires objects for
personal gratification. Craving is generated and sustained by
ignorance; it is linked to personal issues – it centres around a
sense of ’self’. It leads to seeking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) is focused on wellbeing, on what is
truly beneficial and on the quality of life; it desires truth,
goodness, and virtue; it desires fulfilment and wholeness. <em>Chanda</em>
is generated from wise reflection; it is objective – it is not
bound up with a sense of ’self’; and it leads to energy, effort, and
action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two points here requiring special emphasis:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When analyzing whether a person’s actions (including thoughts and
speech) are dictated by craving or not, one can use the following
criteria: desires or actions that are tied up with a search for
gratifying sensations, that protect or promote the stability of a
fixed sense of ’self’ (including on a deeper level the undermining
of the ’self’), are matters that fall under the category of craving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The passages ’craving leads to seeking’ and ’<em>chanda</em> leads to
action’ are very helpful in distinguishing between these two
qualities. This distinction has a crucial bearing on ethics and on
Dhamma practice, which will be discussed below.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Craving desires things in order to experience feeling, and the
gratification of craving is achieved through the acquisition of these
things. Any method used by craving to acquire gratifying objects is
referred to by the term ’seeking’ (<em>pariyesanā</em>). The methods for
acquiring these things vary: some methods require action while other
methods (for example someone else provides the object) do not require
action. In the case that action is required, however, the object desired
by craving does not have a direct causal relationship to the action. For
example:</p>
<p>’Mr. Gully is a janitor and gets a monthly salary of $300.’</p>
<p>’If you finish reading this book Daddy will take you out to the movies.’</p>
<p>Many people will think that janitorial work is the cause for receiving
the salary: cleaning is the cause and the salary is the result. Such a
conclusion, however, is false; it stems from an habitual and
self-deceptive way of reasoning.</p>
<p>For the statement to be accurate one must insert missing clauses: the
action of cleaning results in a clean building; a clean building is the
true result of cleaning. Receiving a salary for cleaning is merely the
result of an agreement made by certain individuals. There is no certain
causal relationship between these two events: some people who clean
buildings receive no money and most people receive a salary without
having to clean buildings.</p>
<p>The second example is similar: many people will think that reading the
book is the cause and going to the movies is the result, but in fact the
true result of reading a book is the gaining of knowledge. To finish
reading the book is merely a condition for going to the movies. {990}</p>
<p>In the first example, if Mr. Gully’s behaviour is compelled by craving,
then he cleans only because cleaning is a requirement for getting money.
He does not desire a clean building and he does not want to sweep and
clean.</p>
<p>In the second example, the child wishes to go to the movies and she
reads the book only because it is a condition for getting the object
desired by craving: to see a movie. She does not desire the knowledge
contained in that book and she has no wish to read the book.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, craving does not lead to action nor does it generate
a desire to act. In these cases, action is merely one possible method
(following a pre-arranged agreement) used for attaining sought-after
objects according to the needs of craving.</p>
<p>These two examples also clarify the quality of <em>chanda</em>, which desires
virtue, truth, and knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>With <em>chanda</em>, Mr. Gully would desire a clean building and the child
would desire the knowledge from the book; both individuals desire the
direct results of these actions. The results ’appeal to’ the causes: the
results help determine the course of action. Action is equivalent to
generating desired results; cause and effect are intimately linked. When
Mr. Gully sweeps, cleanness arises, and it arises every time he sweeps.
When the child reads, knowledge arises, and it continues to arise the
more she reads.</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> desires the virtue resulting from action, and thus also desires
the action itself, which is the cause for that virtue.</p>
<p>In this sense, <em>chanda</em> leads to action and leads to a desire to act.
This helps to explain why the second kind of <em>chanda</em>
(<em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em> – the desire to act) is equated to
<em>kusala-chanda</em> or <em>dhamma-chanda</em> (the desire for virtue or
truth).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn43-1"><a href="#fn-fn43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>If behaviour is guided by <em>chanda</em>, Mr. Gully will have an enthusiasm
for sweeping the building that is distinct from receiving a salary, and
the child will read the book without her father’s enticement to see a
movie. There are many other ethical implications to these two forms of
desire, but at this point simply remember the distinction that craving
is the desire to consume or experience, while <em>chanda</em> is the desire for
truth and action.</p>
<h3 id="problems-arising-from-a-set-of-preconditions"><a class="header" href="#problems-arising-from-a-set-of-preconditions">Problems Arising from a Set of Preconditions</a></h3>
<p>The ethical or practical consequences of using either craving or
<em>chanda</em> as a motivation for action vary greatly.</p>
<p>When a person uses craving as the motivation, action is merely a
prerequisite for obtaining desirable objects in order to satisfy the
sense of ’self’. The person does not directly desire the action or the
results of the action; his or her direct aim is to obtain the desired
objects.</p>
<p>In many instances the required action is merely one method of obtaining
the desired objects.</p>
<p>Therefore, if one is able to find a method of obtaining these things
without having to act, one will use this method and avoid doing
anything, because obtaining the desired objects without having to work
is most compatible with craving.</p>
<p>And if it is impossible to avoid action then one will act reluctantly,
unwillingly, and without real enthusiasm. {991}</p>
<p>The consequences of craving are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When one tries to avoid having to perform the prearranged action,
one may seek a shortcut or an easy alternative to acquire the
desired object without having to work. This avoidance may even lead
people to behave immorally. For example, if Mr. Gully wants money,
has no enthusiasm for or dedication to his work, and feels he cannot
wait, he may seek money by stealing. If the girl cannot put up with
reading the book, she may steal money from her mother and go to see
the movie alone rather than wait for her father to take her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one craves to acquire and has no desire to act, one will
perform required actions simply to get them over with, act in a
hasty fashion, or act to convince others that one has accomplished
the deed. The result is a lack of precision and excellence in one’s
work. And one will develop bad habits like disinterest in
achievement, negligence, and half-heartedness. For example, Mr.
Gully may joylessly sweep day in and day out, waiting for his
salary. The girl may read the book in a distracted way without
gaining any knowledge or deceive her father by reading only the
first, middle, and final page and claim she has finished it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the original agreements have been breached, there arises
underachievement, carelessness, avoidance, and deception. As a
consequence, strict secondary preconditions need to be established
for support and protection. But this is only attending to symptoms,
making the entire system more complicated and confusing. For
example, it may be necessary to find a supervisor and inspector for
Mr. Gully’s work and verify the hours he has spent working. It may
be necessary to have an elder sibling check on the girl or else the
father may need to cross-examine her on the book’s content.</p>
<p>When craving dictates behaviour in response to these secondary terms
and conditions, new layers of faulty and immoral conduct arise until
the entire system becomes disrupted or useless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the desired object differs from the direct result of an action,
then the value of the action cannot be measured by its result
because the action is being performed to serve some other goal. In
such a case, there is an imbalance between the action and desired
results. The behaviour of people who aim for desired objects
expected under the terms of an agreement is likely to be either
excessive or deficient, and is likely to be inadequate for realizing
the beneficial, virtuous results stemming directly from that action.
People then determine the value of the action by the acquisition of
desirable objects.</p>
<p>The basic rule for action performed as a prerequisite for acquiring
desired sense objects, or the distinctive rule of craving, is: ’The
more I obtain desirable things, the more I act’, or: ’The more I
experience delightful feelings, the more I act.’ Action based on
this premise is never-ending and possesses a flip side of: ’If I
don’t acquire desirable objects, I won’t act’, or: ’If I don’t
experience delightful feelings, I’ll remain idle.’</p>
<p>Apart from being defective and a missed opportunity, action that is
performed for results differing from its direct, beneficial results
also creates negative effects. A simple example is that of eating:
when a person eats purely with craving, then if the food is
delicious he will eat till he is bloated; if the food does not
appeal to his desires then he will eat too little, leading to
discomfort and sickness. (The action is eating, which results in
adequate nourishment for the body and is a prerequisite for
experiencing delicious tastes.) {992}</p>
<p>The negative effects of craving are widespread as will be discussed
in further examples below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the case that action and the things desired by craving are not
directly aligned by cause and effect, craving is averse to action
and resists work. Craving attempts to avoid work by trying to obtain
things through no effort at all, and when it is essential to act,
then people act begrudgingly. People acting with craving (following
prescribed terms and conditions) tend to find no joy or
satisfaction, either in the action itself or in the fruits of their
labour.</p>
<p>The things desired by craving abide virtually in isolation,
disconnected from the deed. As long as one does not acquire the
desired objects, the craving for these things remains. And acting to
fulfil certain preconditions may further incite craving, leading to
disturbance and anxiety.</p>
<p>The state of mind of someone who acts with craving is restless,
confused, stressful, and nervous, and is often accompanied by other
unwholesome qualities like fear, distrust, and envy.</p>
<p>A lack of fulfilment and dissatisfaction can lead to severe personal
problems, like stress and mental illness. When these problems extend
outwards, they create difficulty for one’s life in general and cause
affliction for others.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>People who apply wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) as the motivation for
action, on the other hand, wish for the direct results of actions, and
therefore they also want to act. The consequences of wholesome desire
are opposite to the consequences of craving:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wholesome desire leads to upright behaviour, diligence, and honesty,
to sincerity in relation to one’s work, and to a steadfast
allegiance to the natural law of causality.</p>
</li>

<p>Wholesome desire creates an enthusiasm for work; it leads to
precision and excellence in relation to one’s work, to a wish for
success, to earnest endeavour, and to being undaunted by work.</p>

<p>Instead of a complicated system of control and mutual fault-finding,
there is cooperation and a coordinated effort between people,
because each individual wishes for the success of the work rather
than yearning for personally gratifying objects which are scarce and
must be competed for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the action is performed for its own direct results, the
value of the action can be measured by its results. There is a
balance between the action and desired results: a person acts in
order to give rise to beneficial results. For example, one eats the
proper amount to meet the needs of the body and to promote health,
without being enslaved by delicious flavours. {993}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one desires the direct results of an action and wants to
generate these results, one also realizes the intermediate benefits
that arise during the course of action. The wish to act and the
reaping of benefits from action leads to satisfaction, contentment,
happiness, and a deep sense of peace.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn44-1"><a href="#fn-fn44">44</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of Dhamma practice, <em>chanda</em> is classified as one of the
’paths to power’ (<em>iddhi-pāda</em>), which is a vital principle for the
development of concentration (<em>samādhi</em>). Wholesome desire brings about
concentration, which the Buddha called ’concentration as a result of
desire’ (<em>chanda-samādhi</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn45-1"><a href="#fn-fn45">45</a></sup> Wholesome desire promotes mental
health, as opposed to craving, which creates mental illness.</p>
<p>Even in the case when a person is unable to fully accomplish the results
of an action, wholesome desire does not create suffering or mental
problems. Whether the action bears fruit or not, it proceeds according
to cause and effect: the effects are consistent with the causes; the
causes along with any obstructing conditions naturally give rise to
specific results. Wholesome desire does not create suffering because
those people who act with such desire have an understanding of causality
and recognize the direct results of their actions.</p>
<p>Suffering only arises when craving is given the opportunity to
interfere, for example when one worries that people will be critical for
not succeeding or one compares one’s accomplishments with the success of
others. (See

<h3 id="the-act-of-eating-subject-to-preconditions"><a class="header" href="#the-act-of-eating-subject-to-preconditions">The Act of Eating Subject to Preconditions</a></h3>
<p>Following are some everyday examples of these principles:</p>
<p>When the body is underfed then it requires food for nourishment and for
sustaining life. The need for food manifests as hunger, which we can
distinguish as the first stage in the act of eating. Hunger is a
function of the physical body and is classified as a result (<em>vipāka</em>).
From the perspective of ethics, it is neutral: neither good nor bad,
neither wholesome nor unwholesome. Even arahants experience hunger.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Thinking as Conceit</span><a id="note-thinking-conceit"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This form of thinking falls under the category of ’conceit’ (<em>māna</em>),
but craving here must also be firmly established: there must be a
desire for the stability of the ’self’, which is connected to the
conceit and wish to be recognized as a ’success’.</p>
<p>See the passage at Paṭ. 205, which states that the fetter of conceit
(<em>māna-saṁyojana</em>) is dependent on the fetter of greed for existence
(<em>bhavarāga-saṁyojana</em>); it arises due to causes and conditions. (It
is most likely that important parts of this passage have been lost, as
confirmed by the complete passage referred to at VismṬ.:
Khandhaniddesavaṇṇanā, Saṅkhārakkhandhakathāvaṇṇanā.)</p>
<p>The Abhidhamma states that the proximate cause (<em>padaṭṭhāna</em>) of
<em>māna</em> is greed (<em>lobha</em>), and that <em>māna</em> only arises in a mind that
is rooted in greed (<em>lobha-mūla</em>) or accompanied by greed
(<em>lobha-sahagata</em>).</p>
<p>Put simply, conceit is a consequence of craving.</p>
<p><em>See: Dhs. 247; Comp.: Cetasikaparicchedo,
Akusalacetasikasampayoganayo; CompṬ.: Cittaparicchedavaṇṇanā,

<p>Hunger is a stimulus. It prompts the act of eating, and it conditions
the behaviour of eating: if one is very hungry one eats a lot; if not
very hungry, one eats less. {994}</p>
<p>Hunger, however, is not the sole conditioning factor for eating; there
are other reasons why people eat.</p>
<p>At the second stage of eating, for ordinary, unawakened beings, another
incentive or motivation comes into play and determines behaviour along
with hunger: the force of craving.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of craving that manifest at this stage: first, is
the struggle to protect the security of the ’self’ (the craving for
existence – <em>bhava-taṇhā</em>), which is obvious in times of great hunger
or starvation. Craving generates anxiety, agitation, and a fear of
death, accompanying the normal discomforts of going without food. The
stress and fear will be commensurate to the degree of craving. At this
point the person seeks food. When craving directs behaviour, the search
for food tends to be desperate and disregards ethical considerations.
(See Note <a href="#note-seeking">Seeking and Craving</a>)</p>
<p>The second kind of craving is the craving for sense pleasures
(<em>kāma-taṇhā</em>): the hunger for delightful sensations. The craving for
sense pleasures combines with physical hunger to condition behaviour,
either as a support or as an obstruction. This is similar to two people
who are in competition for material gains; if both gain, they help each
other; if only one party gains, they are in conflict.</p>
<p>If hunger is the sole factor, then the degree of hunger determines the
amount of food a person eats; if craving is the sole factor, then the
degree of delicious flavours determines the amount of food consumed.</p>
<p>This, however, is only a hypothetical argument: usually, craving never
allows hunger to be the sole determining factor. Craving almost always
intervenes, and when hunger and craving exist as co-determinants, hunger
obliges craving, by helping to enhance the experience of delicious
flavours. But hunger can only help to a limited extent; it cannot always
accommodate the desires of craving. {995} As a consequence, a person may
be very hungry but the food is not tasty and he eats too little, or he
is not hungry but the food is delicious and he overeats; or he is only a
little bit hungry and the food is not tasty, so he refuses to eat
anything.</p>
<p>Hunger is a warning, announcing the body’s requirements. When a person
eats to satisfy hunger then the body receives adequate nourishment; the
direct result of eating is nourishing the body. But when a person eats
with craving – eats to experience delicious flavours – then he
sometimes eats too little and other times too much, which can harm the
body.</p>
<p>In the case of craving, tasting delicious flavours is dependent on the
act of eating, but it is not a direct result. Eating is the direct cause
for nourishing the body but it is a prerequisite for the gratification
of craving.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Seeking and Craving</span><a id="note-seeking"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People may raise the question that if the act of seeking stems from
craving, then does this mean that someone without craving needs not
seek food?</p>
<p>The Pali word <em>pariyesanā</em> (’seeking’) is used to define all methods
applied for acquiring desired objects. It has a broad meaning,
including methods that require action and methods that do not require
action. ’Seeking’ here is distinguished from pure action. Whenever
seeking is directly linked to its results then it is merely an action
in the ordinary sense.</p>
<p>For instance, in the above example, the body requires food for
sustenance and good health. Seeking is an immediate cause for
obtaining required nourishment, and is thus an action performed for
its own direct results.</p>
<p>The distinguishing factor is the reason for eating. If a person eats
in order to experience delicious flavours, then the process of cause
and effect becomes imbalanced. But if a person eats to meet the body’s
requirements, the causal process is unified. A person without craving
applies reasoned judgement and understanding, reflecting on the need
for food to sustain life and to perform good deeds.</p>
<p>In Dhamma practice, if one’s conduct is based on this kind of reasoned
reflection, then one considers the search for food through righteous
means to be a responsibility and puts forth effort. Even bhikkhus, who
should sustain life with only the minimum requirement of food,
endeavour to find food following their own custom and tradition.</p>
<p>See: Vin. I. 57-8, 96: these passages reveal another perspective on
the distinction between seeking that is a responsibility and pure
action, and seeking that is simply a search for sensual experience
without needing to act.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Craving does not necessarily want to eat nor is it particularly
interested in the needs of the body. Craving only wants delicious
flavours; eating is merely a requirement to obtain these flavours and
there is no other option but to eat.</p>
<p>The tastier the food, the more one eats; one does not consider the
body’s needs and limitations. Similarly, if the food does not taste
good, one refuses to eat. Moreover, one may feel that the entire process
of chewing and swallowing is troublesome, disagreeable, and exhausting.
In this case the body is a recipient of the act of eating, but without
the person necessarily intending to nourish the body.</p>
<p>Figuratively speaking, the living body is one party in a discussion,
while the person eating with craving is another party. When the body is
undernourished, it requires food, but it cannot eat on its own; it
relies on the person to provide it with food. When people are
inattentive to the body’s needs or only grudgingly take an interest in a
proper diet, the body suffers. Occasionally, when the body is famished,
it must complain and grumble in order to get people’s attention. When
the body sends the slightest sign of distress, people hasten to eat.</p>
<p>The body looks for ways to entice people to eat, by offering the reward
of experiencing delicious tastes. Sometimes the body is not hungry and
does not send any signal of discomfort, but people come across delicious
food and eat more than the body requires.</p>
<p>Eating has implications for both parties: for the body, eating results
in rejuvenation, while for the person, eating results in obtaining
delicious flavours.</p>
<p>(In fact, most people do not want to eat; they only want to experience
delicious tastes. If someone were required to eat two plates of insipid
food, he would have to force himself to do so, but if the food were
delicious then he may not be able to wait for the third plate to
arrive.)</p>
<p>When the body offers an incentive for people to eat, it simply waits;
people will eat delicious foods from their own initiative and the body
obtains required nourishment accordingly. {996}</p>
<p>This method of enticement by the body, however, can be harmful and
backfire. If one lacks the ability to consider and reflect, one may be
utterly deceived by the body and only search for desirable flavours; as
a consequence the body suffers. Sometimes one does not eat enough
because the food is not delicious; sometimes the food is tasty and one
not only eats more than is necessary, but overeats to the extent of
causing illness.</p>
<p>The act of eating then does not provide the suitable result of attending
to the body’s needs. Moreover, those people who are enticed by delicious
flavours often create trouble and distress for other people.</p>
<h3 id="procreation-and-sensual-pleasure"><a class="header" href="#procreation-and-sensual-pleasure">Procreation and Sensual Pleasure</a></h3>
<p>A similar subject is procreation. To use a metaphor, the life force
which desires to procreate (or the biological need to reproduce) is one
party in a debate, while the person who experiences sensations is
another party. The living organism desires to maintain the continuation
of its genes, but it is unable to achieve this goal on its own; it
requires assistance from people themselves.</p>
<p>To effectuate this goal, the life force seduces people with the reward
of pleasant sensations, especially through the physical contact in the
act of reproduction. Sexual intercourse has implications for both
parties: for the life force it means a continuation of the species; for
people it means obtaining pleasurable feelings.</p>
<p>At this stage, the life force is untroubled; it simply waits passively.
When people act according to their desires, the life force receives its
desired effects accordingly.</p>
<p>But when someone acts not out of a wish to propagate the species, which
is the direct result of the action, but rather because it is a
prerequisite for obtaining pleasant sensations, the action is
imbalanced. The craving to experience pleasure through sexual
intercourse may lead to many forms of harmful and extreme behaviour,
spreading sexually transmitted diseases and generating crime, affecting
both the individual and society at large.</p>
<p>The matter of reproduction is more complex than the act of eating; the
imbalance here extends further than the relationship between the action
and desired results. People seduced into acting often end up betraying
the life force, which is a partner in this intentional act: the
individual people only want to experience pleasure and have no wish to
provide the life force with its desired goal of reproduction. They act
unilaterally, in order to experience pleasure and to gratify desire, at
the same time obstructing life and preventing it from obtaining any
results of this action.</p>
<p>This alone is acceptable, but when craving increases, people behave
offensively and take advantage of or ’defraud’ the life force. Their
sole interest is in pleasure and they think up ways to intensify this
pleasure. They devise methods to stimulate and spread the fires of
craving, to increase the passion in experiencing sense contact. And they
create the instruments to experience the most extravagant and heightened
sense pleasures possible, as can be seen today by the proliferation of
entertainment centres and various places of licentiousness. {997}</p>
<p>In this activity of reproduction people pay no attention and offer no
opportunity to the biological needs. And they apply a similar attitude
of neglect to other activities like eating, giving rise to various
widespread addictions.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn46-1"><a href="#fn-fn46">46</a></sup></p>
<p>People should deal with this matter of reproduction in ways that are
beneficial to themselves and their communities, by fostering sincerity
and goodwill. They should develop wisdom, which recognizes the true
objective of desire within the order of nature, so that they practise
moderation and avoid indulgence. In this way, people’s actions will
satisfy both the genuine needs of nature and the personal needs of
individuals in a balanced way. Otherwise, the so-called civilization
will end in ruin and devour itself, bereft of peace and happiness.</p>
<h3 id="eating-in-moderation"><a class="header" href="#eating-in-moderation">Eating in Moderation</a></h3>
<p>Let us return to the subject of eating. As mentioned earlier, there are
two factors conditioning a person’s behaviour in relation to eating:
hunger and craving. Indeed, there is another conditioning factor that
may play a participatory role in the act of eating: <em>chanda</em> – a desire
for truth or a love of goodness.</p>
<p>In the case of hunger, wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) wishes for a truly
beneficial state of being; it desires a healthy or optimal existence. It
desires favourable conditions for life: health, ease, an absence of
illness, a freedom from difficulties and from burdens (more than occur
naturally), and a convenience for performing one’s responsibilities,
especially in regard to spiritual development.</p>
<p>The process in which wholesome desire arises is different from the
process giving rise to craving. Craving arises wrapped up in ignorance.
When encountering an agreeable object, one is pleased; when encountering
a disagreeable object, one is displeased. Craving follows automatically
from feeling, without a person needing to think or to have any
understanding of the process.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn47-1"><a href="#fn-fn47">47</a></sup></p>
<p>The process involving wholesome desire is one of ending ignorance; it is
a process of wisdom: of applying thought, understanding, and awareness.
When one eats, reflection and awareness are involved; one does not allow
the indiscriminate reaction of craving to arise along with associated
sensations (<em>vedanā</em>). The process of ignorance and craving ends or
abates and is replaced by a process of cessation. {998}</p>
<p>The first factor to eliminate ignorance and cut off craving is wise
reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), which can also be translated as
skilful consideration, correct thinking, or analytical reasoning. (See
Note <a href="#note-reflection">Reflection Nourishes Mindfulness</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Reflection Nourishes Mindfulness</span><a id="note-reflection"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compare with this teaching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wise reflection nourishes mindfulness and clear comprehension;
mindfulness and clear comprehension nourishes restraint of the
senses….</em></p>
<p>The perfection of wise reflection perfects mindfulness and clear
comprehension; the perfection of mindfulness and clear comprehension
perfects restraint of the senses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>A. V. 118-19.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Wise reflection here investigates in this way: ’What is the result of
eating?’ ’What is the purpose of eating?’ It is aware that the reason
for eating is to nourish the body, to promote health and ease, and that
a natural, healthy state of existence is conducive to performing one’s
duties. One does not eat primarily for delicious flavours, amusement, or
beautification, which would be detrimental to one’s health, lead to the
exploitation of others, increase defilements, and be unfavourable to the
truly desirable results of eating.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn48-1"><a href="#fn-fn48">48</a></sup></p>
<p>Wise reflection is not in itself a motivating force, but it conditions
the wholesome motivation of <em>chanda</em>, which in this case leads to
enthusiasm and desire for the health and ease of the body, for a good
and suitable state of existence.</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> becomes a third motivating force in the act of eating; it
aligns with hunger and both alternates with and blocks craving. If
strong enough, it even cuts off any opportunity for craving to arise. In
the context of eating, <em>chanda</em> generates moderation – to eat just
enough (<em>bhojane-mattaññutā</em>).</p>
<p>In the act of eating, there are thus three conditioning factors or
motivations: hunger, which is specific to this activity and is
inherently neutral from a moral perspective, and craving and <em>chanda</em>,
which are wide-ranging motivations and oppose one another. Craving is
unwholesome and harmful; <em>chanda</em> is wholesome and beneficial. {999}</p>
<h2 id="complex-relationship-between-craving-and-chanda"><a class="header" href="#complex-relationship-between-craving-and-chanda">Complex Relationship between Craving and Chanda</a></h2>
<h3 id="interplay-between-wholesome-and-unwholesome-desires"><a class="header" href="#interplay-between-wholesome-and-unwholesome-desires">Interplay between Wholesome and Unwholesome Desires</a></h3>
<p>Some people may counter here that the desire for good health is most
likely a form of craving, because people want to be healthy and strong
in order to experience pleasure to the utmost. This argument stems from
an inaccurate interpretation; it does not accord with the Buddhist
doctrine of analysis (<em>vibhajja-vāda</em>), which encourages a clear and
concise discrimination of causes, factors, stages, and conditions,
rather than mixing up these factors, etc. and then analyzing them in a
jumbled way.</p>
<p>A state of good health, absence of illness, and ease is inherently
favourable and positive. What one then decides to do with this good
health is another stage in the process.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn49-1"><a href="#fn-fn49">49</a></sup> One may not be desiring
pleasant sensations, but rather wish to rely on good health in order to
perform kind deeds or to practise for the elimination of mental
impurity.</p>
<p>In general, people’s thinking tends to comprise a mixture of
factors and it is important that one is able to distinguish them. At
times this mixture of factors is very complicated.</p>
<p>A person, for example, may think in this way: ’I will eat only enough
and will thus become a strong, attractive, and healthy person.’ This way
of thinking can be divided into three separate parts: a) the person
recognizes that the truly desirable result of eating is a healthy and
strong body; b) the person’s desire and contentment with this supportive
state of good health is pure and unadulterated; and c) there is a desire
to possess this strength and good health, for it to ’belong to me’, to
be recognized by others as a healthy person, or to identify with the
good health and generate such thoughts as, ’May I become a beautiful
person,’ ’I will be stronger than he,’ or ’I will be prettier than she.’</p>
<p>In this case, wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) and craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) overlap
or accompany one another: wholesome desire arises and is then followed
by craving. This accords with the principle that goodness can be a
condition for the bad. When the process of thinking arrives at this
stage of craving and self-identification, it begins to breed suffering
and diverse problems.</p>
<p>For unawakened persons, this complexity is normal and their acts of
goodness can thus still create or increase suffering. The solution is to
apply wise reflection and to establish mindfulness, clear comprehension,
and wholesome desire, in order to bar or cut off ignorance and craving,
and to prevent craving from taking advantage of wholesome desire. In the
circumstance that craving has already arisen, one can try to reverse the
process so that craving conditions wholesome desire, in accord with the
principle that the unwholesome can be a condition for the good. For an
ordinary person to apply these means of correction is already to reach
an excellent level of spiritual development. {1000}</p>
<h3 id="relying-on-wholesome-desire"><a class="header" href="#relying-on-wholesome-desire">Relying on Wholesome Desire</a></h3>
<p>An attribute of craving that ought to be stressed one more time is that
craving acts as a motivation or determining force whenever an action is
a prerequisite for experiencing pleasure. And this attribute reveals the
flip side of this process: when craving is unable to experience
pleasure, it is unwilling to induce people to act. Indeed, it sometimes
urges people in the opposite direction, by inducing them to refrain from
acting, even though the action would lead to a beneficial result.</p>
<p>For example, when a person is ill, the body requires medicine in order
to combat infection, remove toxins, or repair damaged organs. Since the
medicine does not provide pleasurable sensations, craving urges the
person to not take it. In this case, the person relies on wholesome
desire (<em>chanda</em>) for persuasion in taking the medicine.</p>
<p>Occasionally, in times of acute sickness, one develops a lack of hunger
and a lack of appetite for foods that craving normally finds delicious;
here, one does not eat even though that food would be beneficial. At
such times, the craving for existence (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>) may be of no help;
occasionally the craving for annihilation (<em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>) is dominant,
giving rise to utter despair and such thoughts as: ’Without pleasure,
life is meaningless; why should I go on living?’ This craving drives a
person in an opposite direction, leading to a refusal to eat.</p>
<p>In such circumstances a person must wisely reflect on the objectives and
benefits of food, in order to establish wholesome desire and find the
motivation to eat. The stronger the desire, the stronger is the mind;
the person thus resists craving and eats with enthusiasm. (Here, one
sees how wholesome desire supports effort and gives rise to
concentration.)</p>
<p>Some sick people may not be able to generate wholesome desire
themselves. Before they are willing to eat, they may require a friend to
instil a fear of death and a wish for self-preservation. They may then
take the medicine out of panic. When craving for existence is the
motivating force, however, the mind is beclouded and agitated, unlike
with wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>), in which case the mind is peaceful.
This is because craving is tied up with ignorance, while wholesome
desire springs from wisdom.</p>
<h3 id="seeking-gratification-escaping-the-unpleasant-and-protecting-the-sense-of-self"><a class="header" href="#seeking-gratification-escaping-the-unpleasant-and-protecting-the-sense-of-self">Seeking Gratification, Escaping the Unpleasant, and Protecting the Sense of Self</a></h3>
<p>When people are angry and hostile, to the point of killing one another,
the true reason for killing is not a wish for the other person’s death.
The death of an enemy is the same as the death of any other person, in
so far as it offers no benefits to the perpetrator. The real reason for
people to kill an enemy is that this is the best precondition for
acquiring what they desire: to maintain self-security and
self-importance, to escape from that which threatens the stability of
the self, to separate themselves from what is unacceptable, or to cause
the greatest imaginable harm or destruction to a disagreeable person.</p>
<p>If they know that their enemy’s continuation of life will not impact the
stability of their self-identity, and they find another way other than
killing to increase their self-importance, or they find a way to create
more suffering for their enemy than by killing them, then they will
refrain from killing and apply this other, more effective precondition
for achieving their aims.</p>
<p>If people are unable to kill or harm their enemy, unable to eliminate
undesirable people or things, then it happens frequently that they think
of killing themselves or want to die. {1001}</p>
<p>In truth they do not want to die; the real reason for thinking in this
way is that when they are unable to find another means to escape from
undesirable people or things, killing themselves becomes the only avenue
for escape. Take for example someone who wants to kill himself because
he is lovesick – his loved one is marrying someone else – or because
he has some horrible, untreatable disease. Both of these are undesirable
conditions which he is unable to rectify or eliminate, and thus the only
remaining way to escape is by suicide.</p>
<p>If, however, someone else tells him that his beloved has not yet married
and surely still loves him, or that there is a doctor who can most
likely treat the illness, then he will renounce the wish to die
immediately, because there is a more satisfactory provision to escape
from this undesirable situation.</p>
<p>A similar example is the savage practice in interracial or intertribal
warfare, in which the victors slay all surviving males of the vanquished
side, including children and the elderly, but do not kill the young
women, at least not immediately, but hold them captive to satisfy their
pleasure.</p>
<p>The victors do not gain any individual advantage by the genocide of
their male enemies, but kill them out of a fear stemming from a wish to
protect the stability of their collective identity. Killing is deemed
the best method to maintain this stability.</p>
<p>Abstaining from killing the young women does not result from any wish to
preserve their lives. What they desire is pleasure, which is obtained
from these women, and the preservation of the women’s lives is merely a
precondition to indulge in this pleasure.</p>
<h3 id="wholesome-desire-and-lovingkindness"><a class="header" href="#wholesome-desire-and-lovingkindness">Wholesome Desire and Lovingkindness</a></h3>
<p>This subject of desire is linked to the vital quality of lovingkindness
(<em>mettā</em>), as well as to the other three ’divine abidings’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn50-1"><a href="#fn-fn50">50</a></sup> An
examination of lovingkindness helps to clarify the meanings of <em>taṇhā</em>
and <em>chanda</em>.</p>
<p>The quality of <em>mettā</em> is familiar to most Buddhists, but it does give
rise to misunderstandings. Some common translations for <em>mettā</em> are
’love’, ’friendliness’, ’well-wishing’, and the ’desire for others to be
happy and fortunate’.</p>
<p>These definitions seem straightforward, but confusion arises for some
people in regard to the distinction between love that is <em>mettā</em> and
love that is unwholesome.</p>
<p>Unwholesome love is usually referred to in Pali as <em>sineha</em>, which means
love for a specific individual, or selfish love. It leads to
narrow-mindedness, attachment, excitement, and passion. {1002}</p>
<p>This is the opposite to <em>mettā</em> – pure love – which a person feels
towards other human beings and all creatures, as friends on this earth,
companions in suffering, and companions in life and death. It is an
all-inclusive and altruistic form of love, which broadens, eases, and
brightens the heart.</p>
<p>The commentators were aware of this confusion and thus emphasized
certain points in order to prevent misunderstanding. They explain that
the advantage of <em>mettā</em> is a reduction of ill-will, while its
disadvantage is that it can cause selfish love. They describe how the
distant enemy of lovingkindness is ill-will, while the close enemy is
lust (<em>rāga</em>). People must be extremely cautious of lust; one moment of
carelessness and it suddenly flares up.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn51-1"><a href="#fn-fn51">51</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Sineha</em> is a synonym for <em>taṇhā</em>. Unwholesome love, which is the
opposite of <em>mettā</em>, is therefore love springing from or adulterated by
craving. As stated earlier, the main characteristics of craving are a
desire for pleasure and a desire for self-protection.</p>
<p>The criterion, therefore, to decide whether love stems from craving or
not is to see whether the love is a sincere wish for other’s wellbeing
or whether it is a wish for other’s wellbeing merely as a prerequisite
to experience pleasure or to reinforce the stability of the self.</p>
<p>People may allege to love another person, for instance their wife,
husband, or friend, and claim that their love is so great and true that
the other person’s life is of equal value to their own. Later, however,
following the course of time things may change: the spouse’s body, for
example, may change and no longer be agreeable to the other partner’s
desires, or the spouse or friend may no longer support or provide a
sense of security to the sense of self. The former love then fades or
disappears. In this case the person no longer recognizes the value of
the other, no longer recognizes cherished and valued traits in the other
person. This kind of love is not <em>mettā</em>; it is merely love tainted by
craving, or it is craving itself, which seizes the opportunity to take
advantage of someone’s else’s positive attributes to pander to its own
desires or to reinforce a self-identity.</p>
<p>While travelling in the countryside and seeing an enormous tree with
overarching branches and lush green leaves, someone whose mind is
expansive and appreciates the beauty of nature will delight in the
splendour and magnificence of that tree and wish for it to prosper and
be free from danger.</p>
<p>In that moment the mind is devoted and directed to the tree’s wellbeing.
One’s thoughts are benevolent; they are not selfish, acquisitive, or
covetous. The mind delights in the healthy, natural state of the tree.
This state of mind is wholesome, virtuous, and peaceful; it is
beneficial to that person and to others. The pleasure in witnessing the
fulfilment of this tree or the wish for it to exist in a state of
completeness is wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>). One can say that one feels
goodwill towards the tree. {1003}</p>
<p>In the same manner, we may see other people in good health, strong and
at ease, and we delight in their wellbeing, wishing for them to be
happy, healthy, and free from illness. This state of mind radiates
outwards and does not revolve around selfish concerns. This wish for
other beings to exist in a state of happiness and fulfilment is
wholesome desire as it is expressed towards living creatures, and it is
given the special designation as lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>).</p>
<h3 id="continued-harassment-by-craving"><a class="header" href="#continued-harassment-by-craving">Continued Harassment by Craving</a></h3>
<p>For many people, however, the mind does not function in this way. In the
case of a tree or something else in nature, the mind may be easily
receptive to kindness, but in relation to other people this tends to be
more difficult. Craving in one form or another frequently interferes
with or overwhelms the wholesome state of mind. For example, when one
sees a healthy and vigorous person with a graceful body, if the person
is of the opposite sex, instead of rejoicing in the person’s wellbeing,
craving incites one to see the person as a source of personal pleasure.
And if the person is of the same sex, one tends to feel that he or she
is an impediment or threat to the sense of self, causing one to feel
inferior and reducing one’s self-importance.</p>
<p>Instead of having an open, generous and cheerful mind endowed with
lovingkindness, one’s sense of self feels impacted and the mind is
confined, stressed, and tainted by craving. One harbours infatuation,
lust, envy, jealousy, or malice, all of which are unwholesome, turbid,
and uncomfortable states of mind, forms of mental illness, and
obstructive to oneself and others.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn52-1"><a href="#fn-fn52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>A guideline to verify whether one’s love for another person is true
<em>mettā</em>, or is <em>mettā</em> mixed with craving or simply a symptom of
craving, is to ask oneself these questions: If I am unable to derive
pleasure from this person or if his or her existence no longer bolsters
a sense of self-security will I still love this person? Will I still
value and cherish him or her? Will I still delight in his or her
wellbeing?</p>
<p>The love of parents for their children is a good benchmark for <em>mettā</em>.
Parents generally love their children, delight in their wellbeing, want
them to be prosperous, happy, and free from danger. The parents
experience this love without viewing their children as a source of
pleasure and regardless of whether their children’s lives reinforce a
sense of self-security.</p>
<p>However, when the parents are still unenlightened, craving tends to
infiltrate and taint the parents’ love to some extent; their love is not
completely pure, as is evident in the common attachment of ’these are my
children; they belong to me’. Most parents still hope that their
children will help to increase self-security or self-importance, for
example they want their children to have a high social standing so that
they can be proud and share in the prestige, or they fear that their
children will lose social standing and thus they themselves will be
shamed. {1004}</p>
<p>(A slight attachment is normal for unawakened people, but if it expands
and controls the entire behaviour of a person then it can cause
considerable damage. From the perspective of <em>mettā</em>, the important
point is that the love is unconditional: the parents love the child
regardless of whether he or she boosts their sense of self-importance.
When the child is abandoned by everyone else, the parents continue to
provide love and support.)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn53-1"><a href="#fn-fn53">53</a></sup></p>
<p>When conflict arises between their children and someone else, parents
tend to feel indignant towards the opposing party and are biased towards
their children. They are unable to consider the issue in a truly
objective way, because their love is still mixed up with craving. The
love still gives rise to a division between the ’loved’ and the
’not-loved’, and thus still causes problems and causes suffering.</p>
<p>An understanding of <em>mettā</em> helps to increase an understanding of
<em>chanda</em>, because both of these qualities concern the subject of love
and desire, and they are both wholesome, pure, and supportive to the
mind.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn54-1"><a href="#fn-fn54">54</a></sup></p>
<p>There is a distinction, however, between these two qualities: the term
<em>chanda</em> has a broad definition and can be applied universally, whereas
the term <em>mettā</em> technically has a more narrow definition, and pertains
specifically to a person’s relationship to living creatures, to animals
and other people. Living creatures are the objects (<em>ārammaṇa</em>) of
lovingkindness.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn55-1"><a href="#fn-fn55">55</a></sup> In addition, <em>mettā</em> (along with the other three
divine abidings – <em>brahmavihāra</em>) relies on <em>chanda</em> (specifically,
<em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em>) as a foundation or as a primary agent.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn56-1"><a href="#fn-fn56">56</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="review-of-wholesome-desire"><a class="header" href="#review-of-wholesome-desire">Review of Wholesome Desire</a></h3>
<p>The former example of a person delighting in the healthy state of a
tree, without the interference from selfish desires, was a way to
introduce the subject of lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>), but in fact it
accurately describes the quality of wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) itself.
Lovingkindness begins from wholesome desire, but technically it is
confined to a person’s relationship to other people and animals.
<em>Chanda</em>, on the other hand, can be applied to everything, and thus a
discussion of <em>chanda</em> is more wide-reaching.</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> is a satisfaction in and wish for things to exist in an optimum
or ideal way. It is a delight in the integrity of things, the wish for
all things to exist in a wholesome, correct, prosperous, and complete
state. {1005}</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> includes a desire to act in order to bring about this state of
wholesomeness and integrity. One wishes for those benefits that arise
directly from specific actions, in line with causes and effects, rather
than wishing for those advantages that feed selfish gratification.</p>
<p>We can ask how those people endowed with this virtuous state of mind
would respond if they were to encounter the following situations: a
filthy floor in a house, a public place littered with rubbish, school
desks in a cluttered mess, withering trees, a potholed road, a destitute
child in tattered clothes, an ill person with no nursing care, areas
with widespread theft and persecution, drug addiction, rampant gambling,
a lack of attention to education, rudeness and insensitivity, lack of
harmony, or unrighteous behaviour. Similarly, how would they respond to
encountering these conditions: a clean, well-ordered place, a shady,
refreshing grove of trees, a harmonious community, or a peaceful,
contented person.</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> is a love of virtue, wholesome conditions, and a good quality
of life, for example: cleanliness, orderliness, tranquillity, a natural
countryside, and a healthy, refreshing environment.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn57-1"><a href="#fn-fn57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>This state of mind is pure: it does not require a desire for sense
pleasure, or an involvement by selfish thoughts and preoccupations.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn58-1"><a href="#fn-fn58">58</a></sup></p>
<p>Such a state of mind does not arise independently or randomly, but
requires reason and understanding. This is opposed to the perpetual
stream of ignorance and craving, which requires no reflection. The love
of goodness, or the ability to determine what is good, relies on an
understanding of the value or truth of things, unlike in the stream of
ignorance and craving, where a person encounters pleasure and pain, and
then suddenly and impulsively experiences like or dislike. To give rise
to <em>chanda</em> a person must apply wise reflection to sever the stream of
ignorance and craving, and replace it with a cessation cycle: the end of
ignorance and craving.</p>
<p>Wise and skilful reflection may be needed merely to steer a person’s
thinking in a proper direction towards a course of wholesome desire, or
it may involve a great amount of consideration, analysis, inquiry, and
reasoning. {1006}</p>
<p>When wise reflection arises, the stream of ignorance ends. When the mind
sees the value of something, it naturally inclines towards and engages
with it, without the need for force or enticement.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn59-1"><a href="#fn-fn59">59</a></sup> At this stage
perseverance arises, an effort to produce, establish, and fulfil that
wholesome thing or wholesome state.</p>
<p>In some situations the Buddha revealed intermediate, subsidiary factors
in this process. For example, in the Kīṭāgiri Sutta and the Caṅkī Sutta
he presented the sequence of stages in Dhamma practice, beginning with
faith and ending with the realization of the highest truth.</p>
<p>The stages that are relevant to this discussion are that when a person
has listened to a Dhamma teaching and memorized it, he examines its
meaning. When he examines its meaning, he gains an understanding that
accords with the subject of contemplation. With such an understanding
<em>chanda</em> arises. And with <em>chanda</em>, perseverance, etc. (See
Note <a href="#note-learning">Stages of Learning</a>)</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Stages of Learning</span><a id="note-learning"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The entire sequence is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>faith (<em>saddhā</em>) →<br />
a person approaches (the teacher) – <em>upasaṅkamana</em> →<br />
he pays respect (to the teacher) – <em>payirupāsana</em> →<br />
he gives ear (<em>sotāvadhāna</em>) →<br />
he listens to the Dhamma (<em>dhammassavana</em>) →<br />
he memorizes the Dhamma (<em>dhamma-dhāraṇā</em>) →<br />
he examines the meaning of the teachings (<em>atthupaparikkhā</em>) →<br />
he gains an understanding that accords with the subject of
contemplation (<em>dhamma-nijjhānakkhanti</em>) →<br />
enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>) →<br />
perseverance (<em>ussāha</em>) →<br />
scrutiny (<em>tulanā</em>) →<br />
resolute effort (<em>padhāna</em>) →<br />
a person achieves perfect understanding (<em>aññārādhanā</em> or
<em>saccānupatti</em>).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>M. I. 480; M. II. 173-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The stage of examining the meaning of the teachings is precisely the
stage of wise reflection. The understanding according with the subject
of contemplation is the result of this examination, and these two stages
comprise the application of wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn60-1"><a href="#fn-fn60">60</a></sup> When a person discerns and
understands the goodness and value of something, <em>chanda</em> arises: the
mind inclines towards, delights in, and desires this thing. In sum, wise
reflection leads to wholesome desire, which then leads to perseverance.</p>
<h3 id="can-chanda-wish-for-unwholesome-things"><a class="header" href="#can-chanda-wish-for-unwholesome-things">Can Chanda Wish for Unwholesome Things?</a></h3>
<p>Some people may pose the question whether <em>chanda</em>, besides desiring
goodness, can also desire unwholesome things. People perform bad deeds
because they yearn for pleasurable sense experiences, they wish to
reinforce a sense of self-importance, they wish to escape from an
undesirable object or state, or their general way of conducting their
lives is dominated by impulsive sensory responses: when they experience
a pleasant sense impression they are pleased and covetous; when they
experience an unpleasant sense impression they are frustrated, angry and
hostile. The causes for unwholesome or evil actions are ignorance and
craving (including grasping – <em>upādāna</em>); the desire to perform bad
actions thus always stems from ignorance and craving (following the
principle of contingency or preconditions mentioned earlier).</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> on the other hand results from understanding, from a delight in
the integrity of things, or from an awareness of cause and effect. When
one has contemplated things independent of agreeable and disagreeable
sensations (<em>vedanā</em>), and independent of likes and dislikes, one sees
which things are truly beneficial and then inclines the mind towards
them. {1007}</p>
<p>This inclination of the mind towards wholesome things is automatically a
freedom from bad deeds, which result from preferences and aversions
stemming from craving. For this reason, <em>chanda</em> cannot be a desire for
negative states or for performing unwholesome actions.</p>
<p>Granted, actions prompted by <em>chanda</em> may be inappropriate or wrong due
to insufficient consideration or inadequate understanding. The desired,
beneficial results may not arise from these actions, or adverse effects
may arise instead. The true agents behind bad actions, however, are
ignorance and craving; when these factors have been severed, the
discussion of inappropriate behaviour and ways of rectifying this
behaviour is another subject, which will be discussed below.</p>
<p>Conversely, people may ask whether craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) can desire
wholesome things or desire to do good. The answer is unequivocally ’yes’
and this is frequently the case. But the desire by craving for wholesome
things is connected to and contingent on increasing pleasurable sense
experiences or on reinforcing self-importance.</p>
<p>Normally, this desire for goodness is the function of craving for
existence (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn61-1"><a href="#fn-fn61">61</a></sup> for example: the desire to be born as a
god (to have splendour, long-life, heavenly pleasures, or an entourage
of celestial nymphs), the desire to be a hero (to receive praise and
adoration, which will enhance one’s self-image), the desire to become a
stream-enterer (to become great and surpass ordinary people), or the
desire to be a good person (to receive honour and praise, which will
reinforce the sense of self).</p>
<p>Craving is not interested in whether the action is good or bad; it only
requires that the action is a precondition for pleasure or
self-aggrandizement.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn62-1"><a href="#fn-fn62">62</a></sup> Indeed, because craving often desires
wholesome things, people get confused and have trouble distinguishing
between <em>taṇhā</em> and <em>chanda</em>.</p>
<h3 id="interference-and-intrusion-by-craving"><a class="header" href="#interference-and-intrusion-by-craving">Interference and Intrusion by Craving</a></h3>
<p>The confusion between craving and <em>chanda</em> exists because these two
qualities are often intertwined, interchangeable, and interdependent.</p>
<p>For unawakened persons, craving is an ingrained characteristic and
constantly waits for an opportunity, regardless of whether wholesome
desire arises or not. If wholesome desire is absent, craving operates
without interruption; if wholesome desire arises, craving
surreptitiously seeks an opportunity to interfere and take over.</p>
<p>Human beings are able to develop exceptional wisdom and virtue, and when
people develop in wisdom and other spiritual qualities, craving likewise
becomes more subtle and manifests in more refined ways. Therefore, when
wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) arises, craving may interfere immediately,
by taking control, forming personal attachments, identifying with an
object, or creating the division of ’mine’ and ’yours’. {1008}</p>
<p>The arising of craving then sows the seeds for suffering and various
problems. For example, when one is able to sustain wholesome desire
throughout an activity, one will be gladdened and fulfilled by the
goodness and merits of this activity.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn63-1"><a href="#fn-fn63">63</a></sup> One’s mind will be absorbed
in and devoted to the activity and to the excellence it brings, and one
will work with joy and concentration. But whenever craving interrupts
and displaces wholesome desire, such assertions creep in like ’my work’,
’my results’, or ’my future gain’. Craving may increase excitement or
passion for work, but it is often followed by anxiety, with such
thoughts as: ’What do they think of me?’ ’What do they think of my
work?’ and ’How does my work compare to that of others?’ This then
results in competitiveness, covetousness, envy, and stress.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, people will not experience joy in their work,
although they may feel pride (the ’conceit of craving’ – <em>taṇhā-māna</em>),
which comes from having a rival: they may hope that once they have
finished their work they will receive praise and admiration from others.</p>
<p>But if they finish their work and people do not bestow the desired
amount of praise, they suffer. And even if they do receive the desired
praise, later on when this event is just a memory, if they are not fully
aware, they may be nostalgic and miss the good old times of being
flattered, leading to further sadness and depression.</p>
<p>Moreover, some people receive praise after accomplishing a deed and then
forget themselves; they do not purify the mind with insight. Their ego
becomes inflated and they attach to this praise, giving rise to
heightened conceit. They want more and more flattery and acknowledgement
of their own greatness from other people, leading to aberrant, improper
behaviour and harm to themselves and others.</p>
<p>Craving can interfere at any stage of the process: for example, one may
complete one’s work with wholesome enthusiasm at which point craving
maintains: ’This is my work’, or else the motivation for the action may
vacillate between craving and wholesome desire throughout the process.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that craving creates problems at
whichever stage it appears. If these problems are not so severe as to
endanger others or to cause social turmoil, at the very least they
create suffering for the person and become lodged as innate personality
traits. {1009}</p>
<h3 id="desire-for-nibbāna"><a class="header" href="#desire-for-nibbāna">Desire for Nibbāna</a></h3>
<p>When one can distinguish between craving and <em>chanda</em> in everyday events
or activities, then one will also be able to know which of these factors
constitutes one’s desire and aspiration for Nibbāna.</p>
<p>When one listens to the Dhamma and understands the harm of mental
defilements – that greed, hatred and delusion stain the mind, lead to
unwholesome actions, and create all sorts of problems – and one
understands that by eliminating the defilements one’s mind will be
peaceful, happy, and without anxiety, one will recognize the value of
such freedom from defilement. Wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) here is the
delight in and inclination towards this state of freedom.</p>
<p>In the Pali texts several expressions are used for this state of mind
endowed with wholesome desire, including: ’delighting in (<em>abhirama</em> or
<em>abhirata</em>) Nibbāna’, the ’desire (<em>abhipatthanā</em>) for the Nibbāna
element’ (<em>nibbāna-pada</em>), and the desire for ’security from bondage’
(<em>yogakkhema</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-delights-in-nibbana">One Who Delights in Nibbāna</a>) This enthusiasm is a wholesome
quality and an attribute of one who practises the Dhamma in order to
attain Nibbāna.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">One Who Delights in Nibbāna</span><a id="note-delights-in-nibbana"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note the following passages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Buddha is referred to as ’one who delights in Nibbāna’
(<em>nibbānābhirato</em>), Sn. 17;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a person who delights in Nibbāna is released from all suffering
(S. I. 38);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a monk who is not caught up in work, does not indulge in sleeping,
chatting, fraternizing, or mental proliferation, is one who
delights in Nibbāna, and abandons identification with the body in
order to bring an end to suffering (A. III. 293-5);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a monk who knows how to restrain the mind when it should be
restrained, who knows how to guard the mind, who is able to
gladden the mind, and who maintains equanimity when this is
appropriate, is called one who delights in Nibbāna, and is able to
realize Nibbāna (A. III. 435-6);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a therī states that she delights in Nibbāna (Thig. verses 46 and
450);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one who desires Nibbāna conducts his life well in the world
(’fares well’; Sn. 64);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Buddha teaches monks who aspire to security from bondage
(M. I. 4);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Buddha teaches monks to be full of joy and to desire security
from bondage: to desire Nibbāna (M. I. 227).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>However, if one’s yearning for Nibbāna is mixed up with the idea that
Nibbāna is a desirable state or place in which one can reside, then this
way of thinking contains a hidden belief that Nibbāna will provide
pleasure or eternal life, or will finally lead to a destruction and end
to the self. In this case, the delight in and desire for Nibbāna is a
form of craving, which impedes the realization of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The same principle holds true for the desire to become an arahant.</p>
<p>Here we can see the difference between <em>chanda</em> and craving: <em>chanda</em> is
directly linked to action; it is a readiness and enthusiasm to act and
to seek out an object that is recognized as beneficial and desirable.</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> is one part or one stage of action: it is the starting point of
action, the beginning of all wholesome engagement. Craving is a desire
for something that is separate and alien to oneself. Craving only has an
obscure understanding of things; it simply hopes to profit from an
object and seeks ways to obtain or consume it.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn64-1"><a href="#fn-fn64">64</a></sup> {1010}</p>
<h3 id="abandonment-of-desire"><a class="header" href="#abandonment-of-desire">Abandonment of Desire</a></h3>
<p>In reference to Dhamma practice, we can conclude the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is the normal state of affairs that unawakened beings are
governed by craving, and this craving will arise whenever a person
carelessly allows it an opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever craving arises, it leads to problems or to suffering, and
therefore it should be eliminated or abandoned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because craving is always prepared to manifest and to cause havoc,
it is impossible for unawakened people to completely avoid it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two ways to deal with this situation: the first is, when
necessary, to take advantage of craving or to use craving
constructively. The second way stems from the understanding that
wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) supports the realization and acquisition of
things that are truly beneficial, and thus one should establish and
apply it as much as possible. Moreover, wholesome desire prevents and
eliminates craving.</p>
<p>The Buddha stated that craving should be eliminated;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn65-1"><a href="#fn-fn65">65</a></sup> on the other
hand wholesome desire should be performed or accomplished
(<em>karaṇīya</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn66-1"><a href="#fn-fn66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>It is equally accurate to say that both craving and <em>chanda</em> should be
abandoned. However, the abandonment of these two factors differs: the
Buddha explained that craving should be abandoned or eliminated right at
the point where it arises.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn67-1"><a href="#fn-fn67">67</a></sup> <em>Chanda</em> on the other hand should be
abandoned by completing the action that is motivated by wholesome
desire. When this is accomplished the person will no longer require
<em>chanda</em> and it will end automatically.</p>
<p>Craving is a desire that one should eradicate or abandon immediately and
without exception; it should not be sustained or preserved. <em>Chanda</em> is
a desire that one should sustain and bring to fulfilment, at which point
it will end on its own. Craving ends by abandonment; <em>chanda</em> ends by
accomplishment.</p>
<p>The abandonment of <em>chanda</em> by accomplishment is referred to as
’abandoning <em>chanda</em> by <em>chanda</em>’: to apply wholesome desire in order to
bring about its own end. This process is described in the following
passage from the Pali Canon, which is a discussion between a brahmin and
Ven. Ānanda:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Brahmin:</em> For what purpose, Master Ānanda, is the holy life lived
under the ascetic Gotama?</p>
<p><em>Ānanda:</em> For the sake of abandoning desire (<em>chanda</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-abandoning-desire">Abandoning Desire</a>) {1011}</p>
<p><em>Brahmin:</em> Is there a path, is there a way of practice for abandoning
this desire?</p>
<p><em>Ānanda:</em> There is a path, brahmin.</p>
<p><em>Brahmin:</em> What is the path, what is the way for abandoning this
desire?</p>
<p><em>Ānanda:</em> A bhikkhu develops the basis for spiritual power consisting
of the concentration of desire and the mental formation of striving.
He develops the basis for spiritual power consisting of the
concentration of effort … the concentration of mind … the
concentration of investigation and the mental formation of striving.
This is the path, this is the way for the abandoning of this desire.</p>
<p><em>Brahmin:</em> Such being the case, the [pre-]existing desire still
exists; it has not ceased to exist. It is impossible that one can
abandon desire by means of desire itself.</p>
<p><em>Ānanda:</em> Well then, brahmin, I will question you about this matter in
return. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, brahmin, did you
earlier have the desire, ’I will go to the monastery’, and after you
came to the monastery, did the corresponding desire subside?</p>
<p><em>Brahmin:</em> Yes, sir.</p>
<p><em>Ānanda:</em> Did you earlier arouse energy (viriya) … apply focused
reflection (citta) … use wisdom to investigate (vīmaṁsā) in relation
to the question, ’Shall I go to the monastery?’ And after you went to
the monastery did the corresponding energy … focused reflection …
investigation subside?</p>
<p><em>Brahmin:</em> Yes, sir.</p>
<p><em>Ānanda:</em> It is exactly the same with a bhikkhu who is an arahant, one
whose taints are destroyed…. He earlier had the desire for the
attainment of arahantship, and when he attained arahantship, the
corresponding desire subsided. He earlier had aroused energy …
applied focused reflection … used wisdom to investigate, and when he
attained arahantship, the corresponding energy … reflection …
investigation subsided.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn68-1"><a href="#fn-fn68">68</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 272-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Abandoning Desire</span><a id="note-abandoning-desire"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The commentators at SA. III. 258 claim that the <em>chanda</em> referred to
in this phrase is <em>taṇhā-chanda</em>, i.e. craving. By following this
interpretation Ven. Ānanda’s reply means that a person lives the holy
life in order to abandon craving, and his subsequent explanation that
a person abandons <em>chanda</em> by applying <em>chanda</em> must mean that a
person applies <em>kusala-chanda</em> (of the four Paths to Success) in order
to abandon <em>taṇhā-chanda</em>.</p>
<p>Ānanda’s answer, however, clearly states that both the <em>chanda</em> to be
performed and the <em>chanda</em> to be eliminated are the identical <em>chanda</em>
contained in the Paths to Success, which is universally recognized as
<em>kattukamyatākusala-chanda</em>.</p>
<p>Ānanda thus states that a person abandons <em>kusala-chanda</em> by
accomplishing that very <em>kusala-chanda</em>. If one insists that the
<em>chanda</em> in this first phrase refers to craving as claimed by the
aforementioned commentary, then the debate can be concluded by saying
that this is a play on words: Ānanda’s reply begins with <em>chanda</em> that
is craving but he follows up the explanation by referring to wholesome
<em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em>.</p>
<p>In any case, however one interprets the meaning of <em>chanda</em> in the
first phrase, this phrase can be passed over because the content of
the subsequent passage offers adequate confirmation for the kind of
<em>chanda</em> to be abandoned. If one objects to the term ’abandonment’,
one can say that <em>chanda</em> should be ’stilled’ by accomplishment.</p>

<p>In relation to craving, although the Buddha’s primary teaching is to
abandon craving at the moment it arises, he acknowledged the frailties,
habitual tendencies, and lack of preparedness of unawakened persons. He
therefore established ways of practice in which a person may take
advantage of craving in order to generate positive results.</p>
<p>As documented in the Pali Canon, the Buddha claimed that it is possible
to use craving in this way even for the greatest benefit: to realize
Nibbāna. This secondary principle, of relying on craving in order to
eradicate craving, is evident in the following teaching which Ven.
Ānanda gave to a bhikkhuni who had fallen in love with him: {1012}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Sister, when I said: ’This body has come into being through craving;
one should rely on craving in order to abandon craving’, with
reference to what was this said? In this case, a monk hears it said:
’They say that a monk of such and such a name, by the destruction of
the taints, in this very life enters and dwells in the taintless
liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, having realized it for
himself by direct knowledge.’ Then he thinks, ’Oh, when shall I too
realize the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom?’ Then
some time later, based on that craving, he abandons craving.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn69-1"><a href="#fn-fn69">69</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. II. 145-6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The desire of the monk in this story, who has heard of another monks’s
realization of arahantship and wants to become an arahant himself, is
clearly a form of craving: he sees the state of arahantship as something
external to himself and he desires (with a sense of self-view) to
possess or dwell in this state.</p>
<p>The use of craving here is a skilful means: a method to reach one’s goal
and an enticement to perform actions that are required to reach this
goal. People who apply this form of enticement should develop an
understanding of the process so that they will gradually be inspired by
and feel a zeal for the goodness that is the direct result of their
actions. In this way they will generate <em>chanda</em> and switch to this
motivation of wholesome desire by their own accord. To accomplish this
switch is a form of spiritual training. However, if the transition from
craving to wholesome desire is unsuccessful, the exercise is considered
a failure.</p>
<p>The enticement is often not the direct result of the action. For
example, after the Buddha’s half-brother Nanda was ordained as a monk,
he began to think about his former sweetheart and lost his inspiration
for the holy life. The Buddha knew what he was thinking and led him to
one of the heaven realms to admire the celestial nymphs. As a
consequence, Ven. Nanda forgot about his former sweetheart and began to
desire the nymphs instead. The Buddha guaranteed Nanda that if he
continued to put forth effort in the holy life, he could expect to enjoy
the company of celestial nymphs. When Nanda began to apply himself once
again to the holy life, he recognized its true purpose and progressed on
the spiritual path until he eventually attained arahantship.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn70-1"><a href="#fn-fn70">70</a></sup></p>
<p>The Buddha seldom used this method of promising a reward; he used it
carefully, only when he determined that it was most suitable for the
circumstances.</p>
<p>Everyday examples of this method include the promise of a reward if a
child cleans the house or a promise of a gift if a child finishes
reading a book.</p>
<p>This method is a useful tool in education. The person who employs this
method must do so responsibly, by carefully considering how to lead the
child to the stage of wholesome enthusiasm. The person should at least
hope that by enticing the child to clean or to read, he or she will
gradually see the beneficial results of these actions and develop a love
of cleanliness or a love of knowledge. {1013}</p>
<p>Even better, one should encourage children to apply wise reflection, to
understand the value of cleanliness or of knowledge, so that they
develop a love for and delight in these qualities. Wholesome desire will
then arise naturally for them, and cleaning or reading will no longer be
a precondition for obtaining a separate reward.</p>
<p>This method of using craving as a motivation or as a condition for
<em>chanda</em> is acceptable if it truly leads to wholesome desire, but if it
does not it can increase harmful effects, since it is a way of fuelling
craving. It can create bad habits and instil the seeds of suffering into
children’s lives, and it has repercussions in the wider society. It
produces a generation of people who expect rewards and who will not
perform good actions without some enticement.</p>
<p>Those who use this method should make careful and thorough preparations
and be confident of success; they should help throughout the entire
process, until wholesome enthusiasm is generated.</p>
<p>The relationship between craving and <em>chanda</em> is complex. Take for
example a student who chooses to study medicine because he believes that
being a doctor is a lucrative profession and he will become rich
quickly. If he is driven merely by the craving for material comforts
(<em>kāma-taṇhā</em>), he may only study to meet the required terms for
obtaining a medical certificate, or, because he is not truly interested
in medicine, he may not be able to endure the hardship of studying and
drop out part way.</p>
<p>If he wants to be a respected and successful doctor, however, he will
consider that a doctor should have ample knowledge and expertise. This
craving for becoming (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>) conditions him to study in a
determined fashion. The qualities of being a good doctor determined by
the craving for becoming (i.e. of being famous and respected) are
related to the ideal state of being a good doctor, a state in which
<em>chanda</em> delights. <em>Chanda</em> may arise later, helping him to study
earnestly and to seek expertise in the field of medicine; alternatively,
during the time that he tries to fulfil the terms set by craving, he may
be deeply inspired by the medical profession.</p>
<p>In the end he may develop a true love for the study of medicine, receive
a medical degree, and gain expertise, yet still seek out a position that
affords the highest income and the greatest prominence.</p>
<p>Another student may witness many fellow human beings who suffer from
various illnesses and see how their way of life or physical surroundings
are detrimental to good health. She desires a knowledge for solving
these problems and for helping these people. She desires all people to
be healthy, strong, and happy, and she wants her society to be peaceful
and secure. She chooses to study medicine with this thought in mind, and
she is enthusiastic and determined to obtain knowledge to help according
to her intentions. Here, wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) is expressed
through compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>).</p>
<p>If she sustains this wholesome enthusiasm throughout, after her studies
she will choose a position that offers the best opportunity to improve
people’s health and to free them from illness, without giving much
thought to fame or money. {1014}</p>

<p>It is normal for unawakened persons to crave, and therefore it is
unrealistic to expect them to act without being entangled or influenced
by craving to some degree.</p>
<p>The important consideration here is that craving is destructive and is
the source of all suffering, both for individuals and for society, and
therefore one should seek a solution to prevent the harm from craving.
The primary solution is to utterly abandon craving and to prevent it
from arising through the cessation of ignorance, which is achieved
through wisdom.</p>
<p>But for unawakened persons who live amidst various temptations and
disturbances, and whose ignorance, craving, and grasping is constantly
waiting to respond to these enticements, no matter how careful they are
and how much they intend to apply wisdom, they are unable to prevent
craving from playing a role at one stage or another, either on a small
scale or with force, either covertly or blatantly.</p>
<p>The most practical solution to this problem is to establish wholesome
desire so that it can direct one’s actions to the greatest possible
extent.</p>
<p>Human beings have well-developed brains; they are not bound as other
animals are by the blind, instinctual process of ignorance and craving.
Human beings have the opportunity to counteract or restrain ignorance
and craving through the desire for and love of goodness. If they do not
practise this restraint, humans are able to perform the most horrific
atrocities simply in order to experience sense pleasures, escape from
disagreeable things, or protect and reinforce their sense of self.</p>
<p>Even when people appreciate the value of wholesome desire, if craving is
too strong, many of them are unable to continually act in a positive way
as governed by their own sense of goodness or by the moral codes of
society; instead, they seek an easy way out in order to gratify the
desires of craving.</p>
<p>Unawakened persons are generally faced with the choice between a life
governed by craving – allowing craving to be the dominant force
dictating behaviour – and a life in which wholesome desire is elevated
to prominence, in which the person gradually escapes from the power of
ignorance, craving, and clinging.</p>
<p>If possible, one should sustain pure, unadulterated wholesome desire,
but if this is not possible, one should enlist the help of craving but
in a way that supports wholesome desire and is a condition for wholesome
desire.</p>
<p>When a person is able to establish wholesome desire as the motivation
and governing force for behaviour, craving will automatically be
restrained and subdued.</p>
<p>This is precisely the method advocated by Buddha-Dhamma to control and
abandon craving. The teachings do not advocate trying to deal with
craving in a clueless and witless way, without understanding the factors
involved, which only increases ignorance and leads to more harm than
good. {1015}</p>
<h3 id="wholesome-desire-must-be-accompanied-by-wisdom"><a class="header" href="#wholesome-desire-must-be-accompanied-by-wisdom">Wholesome Desire Must Be Accompanied by Wisdom</a></h3>
<p>Concerning this subject of motivation there are three important points
for review. Take the following example:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Two boys named Craving and Chanda have the opportunity to listen
to a radio, a device they have never encountered before. Craving is
delighted by these lovely and strange sounds. He believes that it must
surely be great fun to own a radio and he knows that owning a radio is
cool. If he can get one he will be extremely popular with his friends.
He will be so proud of himself and show off to others. When he arrives
back home he pesters his parents to buy him a radio. He even thinks that
if his parents refuse to buy him a radio he will sneak around the shop
and find a chance to steal one.</p>
<p>As for Chanda, he is amazed when he hears the sounds coming from the
radio. He asks himself: ’How does this machine make these sounds?’ ’How
do people create such a machine?’ ’For what can a radio be used?’ He
desires answers to these questions and thus pays close attention and
makes inquiries. He seeks out a technician to gain more knowledge. He is
so deeply impressed by the benefits of a radio that he may even want to
build one from scratch.</p>
<p>Consider how the different ways of thinking of these two boys will
affect their behaviour and how their conduct will influence their
friends, family and society.</p>
<p>The initial responses and mental processes of these two boys are
similar: the sense base (the ear) + the sense impression (a sound) →
hearing (ear-consciousness – <em>sota-viññāṇa</em>) = the cognition of sound
(contact – <em>phassa</em>) → sensation (<em>vedanā</em>; the feeling of pleasure),
but following on from feeling, the mental processes differ distinctly
for these two individuals.</p>
<p>When Craving experiences the pleasurable sensation from hearing the
radio, he forms an infatuation and he desires more of this pleasure.
Based on this desire, his thoughts are incoherent; he does not apply
wise reflection by considering the truth and analyzing the facts about
the radio. His thoughts of sense pleasure and self-aggrandizement are
determined by craving. These thoughts feed ignorance and intensify
craving. His entire behaviour is governed by craving.</p>
<p>Chanda on the other hand does not allow the process to spill over from
feeling into craving. Instead, he applies wise reflection in order to
block off and end craving. Wise, rational reflection throughly examines
the objects encountered and asks such questions as: ’What is this?’ ’How
did this come to be?’ ’What does this depend on?’ and ’What are its
advantages and disadvantages?’ This way of thinking leads to an
understanding of an object’s true value, to wholesome enthusiasm, to
active engagement with the object, and to deeper learning.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn71-1"><a href="#fn-fn71">71</a></sup> {1016}</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Although <em>chanda</em> is a wholesome, pure quality and is beneficial
to a person’s life, its benefits depend on the degree of understanding
concerning the truth and value of the things a person interacts with.
This is because <em>chanda</em> relies on reasoned analysis
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), which is the beginning stage of wisdom.</p>
<p>If a person’s understanding is inadequately deep or clear, <em>chanda</em> may
lead to errors in judgement. Therefore, in order for <em>chanda</em> to be a
truly reliable instrument for leading a person to the highest goal, the
development of wisdom or an education aimed to cultivate wisdom is a
vital principle in Buddhism.</p>
<p>A person should begin by developing reasoned analysis – to be skilled
in reflecting on the truth and investigating causality, and to ask such
questions as: ’What is the truth?’ ’What is truly beneficial to my
life?’ and ’What is worthy as a goal in life?’ One should then develop
virtues by generating a desire for and love of truth, a love of
goodness, and a desire for an enhanced quality of life. By increasing
these virtues one reaches the highest stage of wisdom, which brings
about utter deliverance and freedom of the mind.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn72-1"><a href="#fn-fn72">72</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> When <em>chanda</em> conditions craving, the result is most often
harmful even for a well-intentioned person. Even though good people may
not become arrogant or overbearing by attaching to or identifying with
the goodness they have created by wholesome desire, subtle attachments
can still cause a considerable amount of anguish. For example, a person
may have the following thoughts: ’Why is my house, my monastery, my
school not as clean and well-organized as theirs?’ ’I have tried my
utmost to train this pupil and sought every possible way to provide help
and advice; why does he not improve?’ ’I have done everything to help
these people become more self-reliant; why do they not make an effort
and progress as quickly as I desire?’ And when the causes and conditions
lie beyond the power of good people to rectify, this can increase their
suffering and sense of affliction.</p>
<p>This form of suffering is particular to virtuous people; a base, immoral
person is not troubled by such circumstances. It is fair to say that
virtuous people experience a unique form of suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn73-1"><a href="#fn-fn73">73</a></sup> Suffering
then offers an opportunity for the wheel of mental defilement to spin
once more, generating such mind states as confusion, depression,
self-pity, indignation, restlessness, and hot-headedness. {1017}</p>
<p>Therefore, being a good person is not enough; a good person requires
help in order to be free from suffering, to have no hidden vices, and to
not convert back to acting immorally. The factor that provides this
freedom and prevents craving from returning is wisdom, which leads to
the supreme liberation of the mind. A person who desires this state of
liberation should apply wholesome desire to lead the way.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn74-1"><a href="#fn-fn74">74</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="consummate-wholesome-desire"><a class="header" href="#consummate-wholesome-desire">Consummate Wholesome Desire</a></h3>
<p>The preceding material should help to dispel some common doubts,
including: Do arahants, who have completely done away with craving and
thus cannot call upon it as a source of motivation, consequently become
indifferent, lethargic, and spiritless? Are arahants, despite their
wisdom, able to act without the desire of craving?</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, craving is not the sole motivating factor behind
people’s behaviour. Moreover, craving is not only a motivation for
action; it is also a motivation for non-action and for laziness.
Regardless of whether craving induces action or non-action, it is
accompanied by agitation and is unreliable. For this reason, people
should cultivate a truly wholesome and secure form of desire.</p>
<p>When people engage in such cultivation, the role of craving is lessened
and ignorance and delusion decreases. Wisdom paves the way for a prudent
application of wholesome desire, leading to blessings for one’s own life
and for everyone with whom one comes into contact.</p>
<p>Eventually, when this cultivation is complete and delusion is fully
dispelled with the realization of arahantship, one need not rely on
craving as a motivation. Wisdom assists wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) to
guide all of one’s activities, with the clear understanding that one’s
actions are truly beneficial.</p>
<p>At this stage, wholesome desire directs one’s activities according to
the supervision by wisdom. There remains no unfinished personal business
for arahants to do, because they are fully satisfied and complete. Their
thoughts focus entirely on how to increase the happiness of others,
which conforms to the maxim of the arahants: <em>bahujanasukhāya
lokānukampāya</em>: to act for the happiness of the manyfolk, for the
compassionate assistance of the world.</p>
<p>In this regard, the Buddha was chief. Besides acting as a guide for
those people still engaged in spiritual development, he also guided
awakened beings in performing good deeds for the manyfolk. In this
respect, the Buddha was indefatigable, because he was a true ’master’
(<em>issara-jana</em>), a true ’liberated one’ (<em>serī-jana</em>). Unhindered by any
internal craving, he was replete with wholesome desire and could act to
the utmost of his ability.</p>
<p>This consummate wholesome desire is one of the Buddha’s attributes. It
is one of the eighteen qualities of the Buddha (<em>buddha-dhamma</em>),
referred to in the phrase: ’(The Buddha) is endowed with unremitting
wholesome desire.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn75-1"><a href="#fn-fn75">75</a></sup></p>
<p>Motivated by this unremitting wholesome desire, the Buddha acted to
liberate beings from mental impurity, suffering, and distress, and to
lead them to peace, by way of his great kindness and compassion. {1018}</p>
<h3 id="great-beings-are-guided-by-wisdom-and-compassion"><a class="header" href="#great-beings-are-guided-by-wisdom-and-compassion">Great Beings are Guided by Wisdom and Compassion</a></h3>
<p>Wisdom does not arise in isolation; rather, it helps to generate other
virtues as well.</p>
<p>When people fall under the sway of ignorance and indulge in sensations
rather than rely on understanding, they permit craving to dictate their
actions. But when wisdom is cultivated, wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>)
grows in strength and has the opportunity to direct people’s affairs,
without being overwhelmed by craving and delusion. Supported by wisdom,
wholesome desire carries out a person’s work. Furthermore, wholesome
desire mobilizes other spiritual qualities to help generate fulfilment
and integrity. In particular, it mobilizes compassion, which plays a
pivotal role in one’s interaction with others.</p>
<p>When one gains a deeper understanding of the truth and of the true value
of things, if one does not permit craving to interfere and take over,
wholesome enthusiasm will invariably arise. One will be inspired by and
develop an aspiration for goodness. One will desire that things be
sustained in a state of prosperity and excellence. If one encounters a
lack of such prosperity and excellence, wholesome desire will act to
bring this to fulfilment.</p>
<p>This is the case in general. If one is relating to other sentient
beings, however, wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) manifests as the state of
mind referred to as lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>): the desire for other
beings’ happiness and wellbeing; a wish for them to achieve prosperity,
to be safe and be free from all forms of oppression.</p>
<p>The wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) for other beings to abide in a state of
wellbeing and integrity is not expressed solely by way of
lovingkindness. Rather, its expression is determined by the specific
circumstances that others find themselves.</p>
<p>Lovingkindness and friendliness manifest in ordinary circumstances. If
these circumstances vary, however, wholesome desire is expressed
differently and is designated accordingly.</p>
<p>If the ordinary state of affairs accompanied by lovingkindness is
labeled the first factor, then the second set of circumstances pertains
to when living beings fall on hard times and are distressed, say in
times of illness or destitution. In these circumstances wholesome desire
is expressed by way of compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>): to feel empathy and to
wish to help release others from suffering.</p>
<p>The third factor pertains to times when others rise above ordinary
circumstances, for example: they finish their studies; they find
employment; they are cured from illness; they give up drinking alcohol;
or they turn over a new leaf and practise virtue. Here, wholesome desire
is content and satisfied. One experiences appreciative joy (<em>muditā</em>):
one shares and rejoices in the delight of others; one wishes to support
them so that they continue to prosper and progress.</p>
<p>The fourth factor is special. When others develop a sense of
self-responsibility, or it is suitable that they have such
responsibility, then we should not interfere. This factor applies, for
example, in the administration of justice and in education. Take the
case of parents, who wish for their toddler to succeed at walking. They
should look on closely in a detached manner, allowing the child to
practise on her own. They are ready to assist if the child trips, but
they do not carry her around all the time out of fear that she may fall.
This refraining from interference is referred to as ’equanimity’
(<em>upekkhā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn76-1"><a href="#fn-fn76">76</a></sup> {1019}</p>
<p>One may wonder how equanimity is connected to wholesome desire and
well-wishing. In fact, this is the ultimate form of well-wishing, based
on true wisdom. One wishes for others to be successful and upright. One
wishes for them to abide in correctness and safety. One wishes for them
to be grounded in righteousness.</p>
<p>These are the key spiritual qualities that follow in the wake of
wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>). Everyone can develop these qualities, but
they are exceptional within the minds of arahants, who are completely
liberated from suffering. When they witness how unawakened beings are
tormented by suffering, their foremost response is compassion
(<em>karuṇā</em>).</p>
<p>The problem for unawakened persons is that in these aforementioned
situations they tend to be governed by ignorance and craving: they will
either be searching for some form of pleasure or they will be fretting
over a cherished sense of self – a ’self’ that needs protection and
pampering – and therefore a pure, spacious wisdom accompanied by
compassion cannot arise.</p>
<p>There are times, however, when the mind of unawakened people is clear
and spacious and they apply wise reflection: they reflect in harmony
with causality and with the truth, and thus cut off any opportunity for
ignorance and craving to interfere. Wisdom here sets the stage for
compassion.</p>
<p>An arahant has made an end to ignorance and craving, and neither
anxiously searches for pleasure nor worries about self-stability or
self-importance. Pure wisdom is constantly prepared for wholesome desire
to express compassion whenever an arahant encounters a fellow being in
suffering.</p>
<p>The end of ignorance, craving, and grasping enables an arahant to act
with purity: to act blamelessly and without such inhibiting defilements
as fear and laziness. The motivating force behind an arahant’s actions
comprises two factors: wisdom and compassion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn77-1"><a href="#fn-fn77">77</a></sup></p>
<p>With wisdom lighting up the way and compassion acting as a force
propelling them onwards,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn78-1"><a href="#fn-fn78">78</a></sup> the Purified Ones – the Buddha and the
arahants – act steadfastly and earnestly for the welfare and happiness
of the manyfolk. Their great works (the Buddha’s deeds –
<em>buddha-kicca</em>, and the teaching activities – <em>sāsana-kicca</em>) have
resulted in the Buddha-Dhamma and the Buddhist religion, which remain to
this day. {1020}</p>
<h3 id="summary-of-craving-and-wholesome-desire"><a class="header" href="#summary-of-craving-and-wholesome-desire">Summary of Craving and Wholesome Desire</a></h3>
<p>Some important distinctions between craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) and wholesome
desire (<em>chanda</em>) are shown on
Table <a href="#tbl-craving-and-wholesome-desire">Craving and Wholesome Desire</a>.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="cultivating-desire"><a class="header" href="#cultivating-desire">Cultivating Desire</a></h3>
<p>Some people like an ordered environment for show, while others like it
for its own sake. The former inclination stems from craving: immaculate
surroundings are merely a precondition for sustaining a sense of beauty;
one’s actions may thus become overly cosmetic or excessive, leading to
all sorts of problems. The latter inclination, however, springs from
wholesome desire.</p>
<p>People who act with craving are interested in defeating other people,
while people who act with wholesome desire wish to triumph over their
work. Those with craving make grand, attention-seeking efforts at the
beginning, but when the excitement fades they become dispirited and
demoralized. Those with <em>chanda</em> act earnestly and in a sustained way
until the work is accomplished. A person with much craving will only
want to have fun. (In such circumstances there may be complicated
factors involved; one may, for example, act under the pretext of
developing insight.) A person with much wholesome enthusiasm is able to
think ahead and act for longterm benefits. (Here too there may be
complicated co-factors; if craving begins to influence the process, one
may start making great plans for the future.) Craving is tied up with
indolence; <em>chanda</em> fears no difficulties.</p>
<p>People who love the truth want to know their own faults and
shortcomings; they are pleased to acknowledge these faults as it gives
them an opportunity to improve themselves. At the very least, such
reflection gives them the chance to assess their own virtues. People
with a lot of craving are obsessed with their own self-image, and thus
are continually in conflict with things and are preoccupied with
protecting their self-image. They derive no benefit from constructive
criticism.</p>
<p>Craving makes one careless in regard to methods of conduct; one tries to
accomplish one’s aims by using any means, including unrighteous means. A
person who loves the truth, however, possesses both an intelligence in
regard to methods of conduct as well as a conscience: the methods must
accord with Dhamma. A love of truth (<em>dhamma-chanda</em>) thus requires an
exceptional degree of mindfulness and wisdom.</p>
<p>Some children try to repair their toys or electrical appliances even
though they have enough money to buy new ones. The reason for this
action may not exclusively be to save money; it may indeed reveal the
child’s wholesome enthusiasm. The child desires for things to exist in a
good, complete state. At the very least the child desires the truth, and
adults should encourage this behaviour.</p>
<p>Those people who possess an aspiration for truth (<em>dhamma-chanda</em>)
should beware of two incorrect or erroneous ways of conduct:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One allows craving to interfere: one allows craving to replace
wholesome desire or to seize control, for example one fails to solve
a problem and then becomes self-deprecating (this behaviour is
relatively harmless).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One has inadequate knowledge or one does not seek wisdom: one who
loves the truth must be able to clearly distinguish the truth or
else one may make mistakes. A love of truth and a knowledge of truth
must thus be paired in order to accomplish one’s desired goals. This
second factor emphasizes the key Buddhist principle of wisdom, which
is central to the path of spiritual development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the Buddhist teachings, human beings possess positive and
negative desires, both of which are prepared to act as a motivation for
action.</p>
<p>All virtuous deeds and all actions performed to solve human problems,
including the act of realizing the supreme goal of Buddhism, depend on
the wholesome desire known as <em>chanda</em>. In the same manner, all bad
deeds and all actions that create suffering are instigated by craving,
which is rooted in ignorance.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is the responsibility of all educational and training
systems – all forms of Dhamma practice – to promote <em>chanda</em> as an
impetus for wholesome action. Such wholesome action leads to a virtuous
goal, which in turn provides true benefit and happiness both for an
individual and for society.</p>
<p>People’s minds are prone to follow the currents of craving. If people
are unable to cultivate <em>chanda</em> – the love of truth and the love of
goodness – as a rival to craving, then hopefully they can at least
eliminate some of the evils found in today’s society and develop in
other wholesome ways. The use of negative incentives as a means of
restraint, say by ordering people to refrain from immoral behaviour or
forbidding them from transgressing certain rules, is inadequate, because
to uphold moral principles without wholesome enthusiasm is almost
impossible.</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> is a positive motivation and an effective agent for restraining
and subduing craving. It is the key to solving all problems and all
evils, and it promotes the development of all virtuous qualities.</p>
<p>If a child loves cleanliness and order, for example, it will be
extremely difficult for her to follow craving and carelessly throw
rubbish on the ground. If she makes a room untidy it is very unlikely
that she will leave it in a mess, and if someone else makes it dirty she
won’t wait for the promise of a reward before she begins to clean it
herself.</p>
<p>Wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) can potentially cause suffering for
virtuous, unawakened people and may even lead them to violence if they
are under the sway of mental attachment and they have insufficient
mindfulness and wisdom. But wholesome desire is a vital motivation for
action and it promotes the development of all virtuous qualities, and
therefore should be promoted with insight and understanding. As for the
dangers posed to unawakened persons, there are ways to avoid and to deal
with them, which will be explained in later chapters.</p>
<p>If a love of truth (<em>dhamma-chanda</em>) or a love of goodness
(<em>kusala-chanda</em>) is strong, it can check the force of craving.</p>
<p>When subject to craving, one feels jealous when one sees others get
something one wants and one cannot refrain from trying to impede them or
from causing harm. In a similar way, when one possesses a love of
goodness, one cannot stand around idly and refrain from doing good deeds
if one has not yet realized the supreme good.</p>
<p>When <em>chanda</em> is stronger than craving, a student will study with all
her energy and endeavour to reach the truth of the subject at hand, even
though a moderate amount of study would produce good grades.</p>
<p>A merchant will try and manufacture products with real quality, even
though he can profit from inferior products and trick the customers who
cannot recognize the difference.</p>
<p>Civil servants and other workers will aim to accomplish the best work
possible in their own area of responsibility, even though they can make
a decent salary without putting forth much effort. {1022}</p>
<p>When an employee or co-worker achieves success, a manager or colleague
will support this success and share the benefits for the common good,
even though he may experience envy, which is a natural response for an
unawakened person.</p>
<p>A ruler or government official will look to the prosperity and highest
good of the people and strive to provide them with knowledge and
opportunities, even though he knows that by withholding this knowledge
or these opportunities he will gain personally and live a life of
material comfort.</p>
<p>People who can take advantage of others refrain from doing so, because
they fear a loss of Dhamma more than they fear a loss of personal gain.
This is opposite to craving, which prefers to forfeit the truth rather
than forfeit personal gain.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is due to this love of truth that the Bodhisatta devoted
himself for many lifetimes to perform meritorious acts for the wellbeing
and happiness of all beings. Because he loved the knowledge of awakening
(<em>bodhiñāṇa</em>), he aspired resolutely towards the truth (<em>sacca-dhamma</em>).
As Prince Siddhattha, he relinquished his royal comforts and
possessions, and braved a life of difficulty, cultivating the path of
awakening until he was enlightened as the Buddha.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-1-three-kinds-of-craving"><a class="header" href="#appendix-1-three-kinds-of-craving">Appendix 1: Three Kinds of Craving</a></h2>
<p>In some aspects the three kinds of craving can be equated with Freud’s
concepts of libido, life-instinct, and death-instinct, although they are
not exactly the same.</p>
<p><em>Kāma-taṇhā</em> can be defined as a craving for the five cords of
sensuality – as a delight in sensuality,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn79-1"><a href="#fn-fn79">79</a></sup> or as a craving for the
six sense objects.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn80-1"><a href="#fn-fn80">80</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Bhava-taṇhā</em> is accompanied by a ’view of existence’ (<em>bhava-diṭṭhi</em>:
i.e. an eternalist view – <em>sassata-diṭṭhi</em>), <em>vibhava-taṇhā</em> is
accompanied by an annihilationist view (<em>uccheda-diṭṭhi</em>); <em>kāma-taṇhā</em>
comprises all remaining forms of craving.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn81-1"><a href="#fn-fn81">81</a></sup></p>
<p>According to the Buddhist teachings, the attachment to sensuality is
more deep-seated and fundamental than an attachment to self or the view
of existing as a distinct self: for example, in terms of the ten fetters
(<em>saṁyojana</em>), self-view (<em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>) is abandoned by
stream-enterers, whereas sensual lust (<em>kāma-rāga</em>) is abandoned by
non-returners. In reference to the four kinds of grasping, the
attachment to the idea of self (<em>attavādupādāna</em> = <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>) is
abandoned at the stage of stream-entry, whereas grasping onto sensuality
(<em>kāmupādāna</em>) is abandoned at the realization of arahantship
(<em>kāmupādāna</em> includes attachment to fine-material form – <em>rūpa-rāga</em>
– and attachment to immateriality – <em>arūpa-rāga</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn82-1"><a href="#fn-fn82">82</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="appendix-2-harm-of-craving"><a class="header" href="#appendix-2-harm-of-craving">Appendix 2: Harm of Craving</a></h2>
<p>If craving (along with conceit – <em>māna</em> and fixed views – <em>diṭṭhi</em>)
replaces <em>chanda</em> and overwhelms the mind, it can cause severe suffering
and harm for a virtuous person. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As a consequence of a person’s love of goodness and purity, craving
may establish an attachment to personal virtue until the person
feels anxious about protecting his virtue, fears a stain on his
character, and fears other people’s misunderstandings. His suffering
over these matters is greater than what most people feel. This
anxiety is related to what Western psychologists describe as a
’guilt feeling’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people have an intense desire to build a virtuous society. If
they are unable to fulfil their ambitions or they meet obstacles,
they feel angry and cling to their personal opinions more tightly,
becoming more headstrong and wilful. Alternatively, they have a
one-pointed mission to revolutionize and improve society, but turn
to violent means in order to eliminate and purge those people whom
they view as uncooperative, acting out of anger and without any
concern for these other people’s wellbeing. <em>Chanda</em> that is
dominated by <em>taṇhā</em>, <em>māna</em>, and <em>diṭṭhi</em> can thus lead to
violence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highly competitive social systems, work systems, and lifestyles
promote selfishness and lead people to act in a way that corresponds
to a craving for becoming (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>). When such systems are
implemented in a society in which there is a high degree of zeal and
a will to act (<em>chanda</em>), many aspects of the society will progress
rapidly. The downside, however, is that these competitive systems
will lead to problems like stress, anxiety, and mental illness. When
such systems are implemented in a society lacking wholesome desire,
they tend to generate immoral behaviour, confusion, and corruption
(I use the term ’tend to’ here because one must consider other
causes and conditions for behaviour).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="appendix-3-the-buddhas-main-attributes"><a class="header" href="#appendix-3-the-buddhas-main-attributes">Appendix 3: The Buddha’s Main Attributes</a></h2>
<p>The Buddha’s main attributes are considered to be twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>wisdom (<em>paññā</em>), leading to the state of being a Buddha
(<em>buddha-bhāva</em>), to being a ’refuge onto oneself’ (<em>atta-nātha</em>),
and to the completion of personal wellbeing (<em>attahita-sampatti</em>);
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>), leading to the accomplishment of the Buddha’s
deeds (<em>buddha-kicca</em>), to being the ’saviour of the world’
(<em>loka-nātha</em>), and to living a life of benefiting others
(<em>parahita-paṭipatti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn83-1"><a href="#fn-fn83">83</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In some of the commentaries, purity (<em>visuddhi</em>) is distinguished as a
separate attribute, but generally purity is considered to be a part of
wisdom because it is an automatic result of enlightenment and therefore
this quality is usually not designated as a separate attribute. In the
Vajirabuddhiṭīkā, the Buddha’s deeds (<em>buddha-kicca</em>) are stated as
twofold: work that is done with knowledge (<em>ñāṇa-kicca</em>) and work that
is done with compassion (<em>karuṇā-kicca</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn84-1"><a href="#fn-fn84">84</a></sup> The Buddha’s and the
arahants’ wisdom is free from conceit and selfishness, and their
compassion is free from attachment and grief. The compassion of
unawakened persons is still a pseudo-compassion, because their minds are
not completely clear and bright: when they feel compassion there are
still personal attachments and affections, along with a sense of sadness
and grief.</p>
<p>With the division of Buddhism into two main schools, the Theravāda
tradition is considered to emphasize wisdom, while the Mahāyāna
tradition emphasizes compassion.</p>

<p>The comparison of reproduction to eating concludes with the
discussion of craving. There are no similar comparisons in reference
to <em>chanda</em>, because <em>chanda</em> is not required for the act of
reproduction, and reproduction is not connected to the realization
of a wholesome life. Reproduction is influenced by the power of
craving for existence (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>), in order to maintain the
stability of the ’self’. Dhamma practice depends on eating, but it
does not depend on reproduction; eating is required to practise the
Dhamma, but reproduction is not; the life that presently exists is
sustained by eating, not by procreating. <a href="#fr-fn46-1">↩</a></p>

<p>People with an abundance of <em>chanda</em> strive for quality of life
and seek what is truly valuable for their lives. In the Pali Canon,
a person who strives for goodness is called a <em>kusalānu-esī</em>,
meaning someone who seeks the noble path (<em>ariya-magga</em>) or seeks
Nibbāna (Sn. 187; Nd. I. 486). The Bodhisatta (the Buddha), when he
went in search of the Truth, is referred to as ’one who seeks that
which is wholesome’ (<em>kiṅkusalānu-esī</em> – D. II. 151-2, or
<em>kiṅkusala-gavesī</em> – M. I. 163-4). <a href="#fr-fn57-1">↩</a></p>

<p>Beware of confusion between <em>chanda</em> and <em>taṇhā</em>. When one enters
an area that is clean and refreshing, for example, craving too can
lead to feelings of delight and satisfaction. The difference is that
craving delights in the pleasant sensations stemming from seeing,
hearing, touching, etc. various sense objects located in that place;
it does not delight in goodness directly. The action resulting from
craving is to linger in that place to experience sense pleasure, and
may lead to laziness. <a href="#fr-fn59-1">↩</a></p>

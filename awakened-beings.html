<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>There is a well-known teaching in the Buddhist scriptures describing the
stages of enlightenment – the stages of realizing Nibbāna. This
comprises the four paths (<em>magga</em>) and four fruits (<em>phala</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The path and fruit of stream-entry<br />
(<em>sotāpatti-magga</em> and <em>sotāpatti-phala</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The path and fruit of once-returning<br />
(<em>sakadāgāmi-magga</em> and <em>sakadāgāmi-phala</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The path and fruit of non-returning<br />
(<em>anāgāmi-magga</em> and <em>anāgāmi-phala</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The path and fruit of arahantship<br />
(<em>arahatta-magga</em> and <em>arahatta-phala</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first ’path’ of stream-entry is also called ’vision’ (<em>dassana</em>),
because it refers to the first glimpse of Nibbāna. The following three
’paths’, of once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship, are
collectively known as ’cultivation’ (<em>bhāvanā</em>), since they involve a
development in the Dhamma initially realized at the moment of
stream-entry.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn1-1"><a href="#fn-fn1">1</a></sup> {403}</p>
<p>Those who have reached complete realization of Nibbāna, as well as those
who obtain a first glimpse of the goal and are thus guaranteed to reach
it, are classified as true disciples of the Buddha. They are known as
the ’community of disciples’ (<em>sāvaka-saṅgha</em>), as seen for example in
the verse praising the attributes of the Sangha: ’They are the Blessed
One’s disciples who have practised well.’</p>
<p>There are many special terms used to describe these true disciples. The
most frequently used term is <em>ariya-puggala</em> (or <em>ariya</em>), translated as
’cultivated’, ’noble’, or ’far from the foe’ (i.e. far from mental
defilement). The term <em>ariya-puggala</em> was originally used in a general
sense; only later was it used specifically in relation to the stages of
enlightenment.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn2-1"><a href="#fn-fn2">2</a></sup> The original term used in the Pali Canon when
distinguishing the stages of enlightenment is <em>dakkhiṇeyya</em> (or
<em>dakkhiṇeyya</em>-<em>puggala</em>). In any case, the terms <em>ariya-puggala</em> and
<em>dakkhiṇeyya</em>-<em>puggala</em> were adopted from Brahmanism. The Buddha altered
their meanings, as he did with many other words, for example: <em>brahmā</em>,
<em>brāhmaṇa</em> (’brahmin’), <em>nahātaka</em> (’washed clean’), and <em>vedagū</em>
(’sage’).</p>
<p>The Buddha gave the term <em>ariya</em> a new definition, different from that
prescribed by the brahmins. The word <em>ariya</em> (Sanskrit: <em>ārya</em>; English:
Aryan) originally referred to a race of people who migrated from the
northwest regions and invaded the Indian subcontinent several thousand
years ago. As a result of this invasion, the native inhabitants
retreated either south or into the forests and mountains. The Aryans
considered themselves cultivated; they disdained the native people,
marking them as savages and enslaving them. Later, when the Aryans had
consolidated their rule and established the caste system, the native
peoples were accorded the lowest tier as <em>sudda</em> (Śūdra; labourers). The
term <em>ariya</em> (’noble’) designated the three upper castes of <em>khattiya</em>
(Kṣatriyaḥ; warriors, kings, administrators), <em>brāhmaṇa</em> (brahmins;
scholars, priests, teachers), and <em>vessa</em> (Vaishya; merchants). Suddas
and all others were labelled <em>anariya</em> (’ignoble’, ’base’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn3-1"><a href="#fn-fn3">3</a></sup> A
person’s caste was determined at birth; there was no way to choose or
alter one’s position.</p>
<p>When the Buddha began teaching, he declared that nobility does not
depend on birth, but rather on righteousness (Dhamma), which stems from
spiritual practice and training. Whoever acts in line with noble
principles (<em>ariya-dhamma</em>) is ’noble’ (<em>ariya</em>) irrespective of birth
or caste. Whoever does not is <em>anariya</em>. Truth is not restricted to the
dictates of brahmins and the Vedas,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn4-1"><a href="#fn-fn4">4</a></sup> but is objective and universal.
A person who has realized these universal truths is noble, despite
having never studied the Vedas. Because knowledge of these truths makes
one noble, they are called the ’noble truths’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn5-1"><a href="#fn-fn5">5</a></sup> {404} Technically,
those who understand the noble truths are stream-enterers and above.
Therefore, the scriptures generally use the term <em>ariya</em> as synonymous
with <em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em> (’those worthy of offerings’), a term which
will be discussed shortly.</p>
<p>The Four Noble Truths (<em>ariya-sacca</em>) are sometimes referred to as the
<em>ariya-dhamma</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn6-1"><a href="#fn-fn6">6</a></sup> The term <em>ariya-dhamma</em>, however, does not have a
fixed definition and is used in other contexts.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn7-1"><a href="#fn-fn7">7</a></sup> It can refer to the
ten ’wholesome ways of action’ (<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn8-1"><a href="#fn-fn8">8</a></sup> and to the five
precepts.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn9-1"><a href="#fn-fn9">9</a></sup> Such definitions are not contradictory, since those
householders who truly keep the five precepts their entire lives,
without blind adherence (<em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>) and without blemish, are
stream-enterers and above. The standard commentarial definition of
<em>ariya</em> in reference to ’noble’ people encompasses the Buddha,
Pacceka-Buddhas<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn10-1"><a href="#fn-fn10">10</a></sup> and disciples of the Buddha,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn11-1"><a href="#fn-fn11">11</a></sup> although in some
places the definition refers to the Buddha alone.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn12-1"><a href="#fn-fn12">12</a></sup> When qualifying a
spiritual practice or factor, <em>ariya</em> is equivalent to ’transcendent’
(<em>lokuttara</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn13-1"><a href="#fn-fn13">13</a></sup> although this is not always strictly the case.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn14-1"><a href="#fn-fn14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the definition of <em>ariya</em> is rather broad, one can summarize
that when the term is used in reference to people it is identical to
<em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em>, meaning those who have gone beyond the state of
ordinary persons and become members of the <em>sāvaka-saṅgha</em> (today, more
often called the <em>ariya-saṅgha</em>). (See also
Note <a href="#note-categories-ariyas">Commentarial Categories of Ariyas</a>). In the commentaries and
sub-commentaries this definition is almost fixed, with very few
exceptions. In the scriptures, the term <em>ariya</em> tends to be used in a
general sense, not specifying the level of awakening. <em>Dakkhiṇeyya</em> is
the more specific technical term and is used less often than <em>ariya</em>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Commentarial Categories of Ariyas</span><a id="note-categories-ariyas"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some exceptions include passages at: J. II. 42; 280; J. III. 81;
J. IV. 293. The commentaries explain these exceptions by classifying
<em>ariya</em> into four categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>ācāra-ariya</em> – noble by behaviour; those grounded in virtue;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>dassana-ariya</em> – noble in appearance; those possessing features
that instil confidence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>liṅga-ariya</em> – noble by ’gender’, i.e. those living the life of
a spiritual renunciant (<em>samaṇa</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>paṭivedha-ariya</em> – noble through realization, i.e. the Buddha,
Pacceka-Buddhas and enlightened disciples of the Buddha.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>J. II. 42, 280; J. III. 354; J. IV. 291.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha extended the meaning of the term <em>ariya</em>, referring to
members of a new community, i.e. Buddhist disciples who are ennobled by
practising the Middle Way. These disciples live ethically, non-violently
and in harmony. They are dedicated to promoting wellbeing for all. {405}
Their actions are not ruled by the enticements and threats of religious
officials, who often cater to people’s selfish needs. Moral principles
may be perverted due to the decisions of such religious authorities. An
example of this is the sacrifice of animals performed by brahmins.</p>
<p><em>Dakkhiṇeyya</em> translates as ’one worthy of offerings’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn15-1"><a href="#fn-fn15">15</a></sup> The original
Brahmanic meaning of this word referred to the payment received for
performing ceremonies, particularly sacrifices (<em>yañña</em>; Sanskrit:
<em>yajña</em>). The Vedas describe the forms of payment, including: gold,
silver, household goods, furniture, vehicles, grain, livestock, young
women, and land. The more prestigious the ceremony the greater the
reward. For example, in the <em>Ashvamedha</em> (’royal horse sacrifice’) the
king shared the spoils of war with the priests. The recipients of these
gifts were invariably the brahmins, because they were the only ones
entitled to perform the rituals.</p>
<p>When the Buddha began teaching he spoke in favour of abolishing animal
sacrifice, and he transformed the meanings of the words <em>yañña</em> and
<em>dakkhiṇā</em>. He developed the meaning of <em>yañña</em> into cruelty-free
almsgiving, while <em>dakkhiṇā</em> in the Buddhist teachings refers to
suitable gifts and faithful donations, not a fee or recompense.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn16-1"><a href="#fn-fn16">16</a></sup> If
it is a reward then it is a reward for virtue, but it is more aptly
called an offering in honour of virtue. In addition, these gifts are not
excessively lavish, but simple and basic requisites essential for
life.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn17-1"><a href="#fn-fn17">17</a></sup></p>
<p>Persons worthy of these offerings have trained themselves and are full
of goodness. They embody a virtuous and joyful life. Their very
existence in the world is a blessing to others. When they go out into
the wider society and impart these virtuous principles, living as an
example and instructing others, they offer a priceless service to the
world. And these individuals do not demand or wish for recompense. They
rely on the offerings of the four requisites merely to sustain life.
Offerings made to such people bear great fruit because the offerings
permit goodness to manifest and increase in the world. These people are
called ’worthy of offerings’ (<em>dakkhiṇeyya</em>) because offerings made to
them yield valuable results. They are also referred to as the
’incomparable field of merit’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn18-1"><a href="#fn-fn18">18</a></sup> because they are a source of virtue
to blossom and spread in the world.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn19-1"><a href="#fn-fn19">19</a></sup> {406}</p>
<p>People give suitable remuneration to ordinary teachers; is it not
appropriate for people to give simple gifts to those who teach virtue
and the ways of truth? In today’s society people whose business causes
destruction – harming the economy, the environment, or even human
goodness – receive all sorts of lavish rewards.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn20-1"><a href="#fn-fn20">20</a></sup> Is it not right
that those who protect the world and protect virtue by being moderate in
consumption should receive support? Those who consume only what is
necessary have minimal impact on the world’s resources; they take little
and give much in return.</p>
<p>The making of offerings differs from ordinary giving; one does not give
out of personal affection, obligation, or an expectation to get
something in return. One gives with faith in the power of goodness,
appreciating that the recipient is a member of the Buddhist monastic
community (<em>saṅgha</em>), or that he or she upholds virtue. In any case, the
recipient must possess the necessary qualities to be entitled to these
offerings. For example, an unenlightened monk or novice who eats the
almsfood of lay-supporters is ’indebted’, despite having moral conduct
and making effort in Dhamma practice. He should hasten to free himself
from this debt by achieving the state of a <em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em>. Ven.
Mahā Kassapa, for example, claimed that he was in debt to the laypeople
for seven days, between being ordained and realizing arahantship.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn21-1"><a href="#fn-fn21">21</a></sup>
After his ordination he made effort in Dhamma practice as an unawakened
person for seven days, before reaching the fruit of arahantship and
becoming one worthy of the offerings by the faithful laypeople.</p>
<p>The commentaries categorize monks and novices who receive offerings in
four ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Those who behave immorally. They do not have the inner qualities
fitting for a mendicant and merely wear the outward signs of a monk.
They are undeserving of offerings; their use of offerings is called
<em>theyya-paribhoga</em>: ’to consume as a thief’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those who have moral conduct but do not reflect with wisdom when
using the four requisites. For example, when eating almsfood they
neglect to consider: ’I eat not for pleasure or beautification. I
use almsfood only for the maintenance and nourishment of this body,
to keep it healthy, to sustain the holy life.’ Such use of offerings
is called <em>iṇa-paribhoga</em>: ’to consume as a debtor’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn22-1"><a href="#fn-fn22">22</a></sup> {407}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sekha</em>, or the first seven of the eight <em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em> (see
below). Their use of offerings is called <em>dāyajja-paribhoga</em>: ’to
consume as heirs’. They have the right to use these offerings as
heirs to the Buddha, who was supreme among the
<em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arahants, who are freed from the enslavement of craving. Their
virtue makes them truly worthy of offerings. Their use of offerings
is called <em>sāmi-paribhoga</em>: ’to consume as masters’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn23-1"><a href="#fn-fn23">23</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here we can see that the term <em>dakkhiṇeyya</em> is used in both social and
economic contexts. The principle of offerings (and to some extent the
principle of generosity) fits into the wider principle of the Buddhist
social structure, of having an independent group of individuals (the
monastic sangha) within a wider society. These individuals gain their
independence by not seeking benefits from society and not being directly
involved in other social institutions. They have their own way of life
based on spiritual freedom. They support society by transmitting the
Dhamma, without seeking recompense for their work. They live on
offerings by members of the wider society, who give out of devotion to
the Dhamma in order to preserve the teachings and purify themselves of
unwholesome qualities like greed. Offering this support has minimal
financial impact on the supporters’ lives.</p>
<p>The recipients (the monastic sangha) are like bees who collect pollen
from various flowers to make honey and build their hives, without
damaging even the fragrance or complexion of the flowers.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn24-1"><a href="#fn-fn24">24</a></sup> Indeed,
they fertilize the flowers. Because they depend on others to live, they
have an obligation to act for the welfare and happiness of all. Although
their life depends on others it does not depend on anyone in particular;
they rely on the public and in a sense belong to the public, but are
subject to no single individual.</p>
<p>In a well-organized society no one should be destitute and forced to
beg.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn25-1"><a href="#fn-fn25">25</a></sup> In such a society religious mendicants live on the offerings
of others but the receiving of alms has no resemblance to begging. This
system of an independent community that is devoted to spiritual values
and provides a necessary balance to the wider society is unique among
social systems in the world.</p>
<p>There are generally two ways to categorize <em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em> or
<em>ariya-puggala</em>: into the eight levels of eradicating defilements (the
eight levels of path and fruit mentioned above), and into the seven
qualities or practices that enable the attainment of those eight levels.
(The first of these classifications is presented below; the second
classification is presented in a following section.)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn26-1"><a href="#fn-fn26">26</a></sup> {408}</p>
<h2 id="eight-noble-beings"><a class="header" href="#eight-noble-beings">Eight Noble Beings</a></h2>
<p>This division is associated with the ten ’fetters’ (<em>saṁyojana</em>), which
are abandoned at different levels of awakening, and with the development
of the threefold training (<em>sikkhā</em>) of moral conduct, concentration,
and wisdom. The ten fetters are those defilements that bind beings to
suffering in the round of rebirth, similar to yokes that bind an animal
to a wagon:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn27-1"><a href="#fn-fn27">27</a></sup></p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Five lower fetters (<em>orambhāgiya-saṁyojana</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <em>Sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>: self-view; the firm belief in a ’self’; the
inability to see that beings are simply a collection of assorted
aggregates. This view creates a coarse form of selfishness, as
well as conflict and suffering.</p>
<p>The stock definition is: <em>One regards material form as self, or
self as possessed of material form, or material form as in self,
or self as in material form. One regards feeling as self…. One
regards perception as self…. One regards volitional formations
as self…. One regards consciousness as self … or self as in
consciousness</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn28-1"><a href="#fn-fn28">28</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <em>Vicikicchā</em>: doubt; hesitation; distrust. Doubts, for example,
regarding the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, the training, the
direction of one’s life, and Dependent Origination. This doubt
generates a lack of confidence, courage, and discernment in
walking the Noble Path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <em>Sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>: attachment to moral precepts and religious
practices. Attachment to form and ceremony. The mistaken
understanding that one will be purified and liberated merely by
the act of keeping moral precepts, rules, traditions, and
practices. The belief that these rules and practices are sacred
in themselves. One follows them with the desire for reward or
acquisition. Missing the true purpose of moral precepts and
religious observances, one ends up astray or in an extreme form
of practice (say of practising extreme asceticism – <em>tapa</em>),
not on the Noble Path.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn29-1"><a href="#fn-fn29">29</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <em>Kāma-rāga</em>: sensual lust; desire for pleasurable sights,
sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>5.</strong> <em>Paṭigha</em>: animosity; irritation; indignation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Five higher fetters (<em>uddhambhāgiya-saṁyojana</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <em>Rūpa-rāga</em>: attachment to fine-material form, e.g. attachment
to the four jhānas of the fine-material sphere; delighting in
the bliss and peace of these jhānas; desiring the fine-material
sphere (<em>rūpa-bhava</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <em>Arūpa-rāga</em>: attachment to immateriality, e.g. attachment to
the four immaterial jhānas; desire for the formless sphere
(<em>arūpa-bhava</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>8.</strong> <em>Māna</em>: conceit; the view of oneself as superior, equal, or
inferior to others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>9.</strong> <em>Uddhacca</em>: restlessness; mental disturbance; agitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10.</strong> <em>Avijjā</em>: ignorance; not knowing the truth; not knowing the law
of cause and effect; not knowing the Four Noble Truths. {409}</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p>The eight <em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em> or <em>ariya-puggala</em> can be classified
into four types or stages, which are related to the fetters in the
following way:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn30-1"><a href="#fn-fn30">30</a></sup></p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A.</strong>  <em>Sekha</em> (’learners’) or <em>sa-upādisesa-puggala</em> (’those who still
have grasping’):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <em>Sotāpanna</em>: ’stream-enterers’; those who walk the noble path
truly and correctly.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn31-1"><a href="#fn-fn31">31</a></sup> They have perfect moral conduct and an
adequate level of concentration and wisdom. They have abandoned
the first three fetters of <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>, <em>vicikicchā</em> and
<em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn32-1"><a href="#fn-fn32">32</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <em>Sakadāgāmī</em>: ’once-returners’; those who will return to this
world one more time and eliminate all suffering. They have
perfect moral conduct and an adequate level of concentration and
wisdom. Apart from abandoning the first three fetters, they have
attenuated greed, hatred and delusion to a greater degree than
stream-enterers.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn33-1"><a href="#fn-fn33">33</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <em>Anāgāmī</em>: ’non-returners’; they reach final enlightenment from
the realm where they appear after death – they do not return to
this world. They have perfect moral conduct and concentration,
and an adequate level of wisdom. They have abandoned two more
fetters, of <em>kāma-rāga</em> and <em>paṭigha</em>, thus abandoning the first
five fetters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>B.</strong> <em>Asekha</em> (’those who have finished training’) or
<em>anupādisesa-puggala</em> (’those with no grasping’):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4.</strong> <em>Arahant</em>: ’worthy ones’; those worthy of offerings and respect;
those who have broken the spokes of the wheel of <em>saṁsāra</em>;
those free from mental taints (<em>āsava</em>). They have perfect moral
conduct, concentration and wisdom. They have abandoned the
remaining five fetters, thus abandoning all ten fetters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><em>Sekha</em>, translated as ’learners’ or ’trainees’, must apply themselves
to sever the fetters and realize the gradual stages up to arahantship.
<em>Asekha</em>, the arahants, are adepts; they have gone beyond training. They
have finished their spiritual work and eradicated all defilements. They
have reached the greatest good; there is no higher spiritual realization
for which to strive.</p>
<p><em>Sa-upādisesa-puggala</em> are equivalent to the first three
<em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em> above. They still have <em>upādi</em> (’fuel’), that is,
they still have <em>upādāna</em> (’grasping’) – they still have mental
impurities. <em>Anupādisesa-puggala</em>, the arahants, are free from grasping
and impurity. Note that <em>upādi</em> here is translated as synonymous with
<em>upādāna</em> (’grasping’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn34-1"><a href="#fn-fn34">34</a></sup> This differs from the <em>upādi</em> in
<em>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</em> and <em>anupādisesa-nibbāna</em>, which translates as
’that which is grasped’, i.e. the five aggregates. {410} The equating of
<em>upādi</em> with <em>upādāna</em> corresponds with the Buddha’s teachings on
essential spiritual factors, for example the Four Foundations of
Mindfulness (<em>sati-paṭṭhāna</em>), the Four Ways of Success (<em>iddhi-pāda</em>),
and the Five Faculties (<em>indriya</em>), which often end with the
encouragement that one can expect one of two results from cultivating
these factors: either arahantship in this very life, or if there is a
residue of clinging, the state of non-returning.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn35-1"><a href="#fn-fn35">35</a></sup> The term <em>upādi</em>
in these contexts refers to <em>upādāna</em> or generally to mental defilement
(<em>kilesa</em>).</p>
<p>The eight noble beings are precisely these four <em>ariya-puggala</em>
described above, but each level of awakening is subdivided as a
pair:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn36-1"><a href="#fn-fn36">36</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
<p>These days one finds the translation of these pairs as ’fruition of
stream-entry’ (<em>sotāpatti-phala</em>), ’path of stream-entry’
(<em>sotāpatti-magga</em>), ’fruition of once-returning’
(<em>sakadāgāmi-phala</em>), ’path of once-returning’ (<em>sakadāgāmi-magga</em>),
etc. This translation follows commentarial terminology: for

<em>sotāpatti-magga</em>, <em>sakadāgāmi-magga</em> and <em>anāgāmi-magga</em> do not
appear in the older texts of the Tipiṭaka; they first appear in the
Niddesa, Paṭisambhidāmagga and the Abhidhamma. In the older texts, the
term <em>arahatta-magga</em> is only found in the passages: <em>arahā vā assasi
arahattamaggaṁ vā samāpanno</em> and <em>arahanto vā arahattamaggaṁ vā
samāpannā</em>: Vin. I. 32, 39; D. I. 144; S. I. 78; A. II. 42; A. III.
391; Ud. 7, 65. In later texts, e.g. the Niddesa, Paṭisambhidāmagga
and the Abhidhamma, it is extensively used.</p>

</div>
<p>These four pairs of noble beings are known as the <em>sāvaka-saṅgha</em>, the
disciples of the Buddha who are considered exemplary human beings and
comprise one of the three ’jewels’ (<em>ratana</em>) in Buddhism. The chant in
praise of the Sangha includes: ’The four pairs, the eight kinds of noble
beings; these are the Blessed One’s disciples’ (<em>yadidaṁ cattāri
purisayugāni aṭṭha purisapuggalā esa bhagavato sāvaka-saṅgho</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn37-1"><a href="#fn-fn37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>In the scriptures, these disciples of the Buddha are later referred to
as the ’noble sangha’ (<em>ariya-saṅgha</em>). In the older texts, the term
<em>ariya-saṅgha</em> is used only once as a synonym for <em>sāvaka-saṅgha</em>, in a
verse of the Aṅguttara-Nikāya.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn38-1"><a href="#fn-fn38">38</a></sup> In the commentaries it is used
frequently, especially in the Visuddhimagga.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn39-1"><a href="#fn-fn39">39</a></sup> When the term
<em>ariya-saṅgha</em> gained popularity over <em>sāvaka-saṅgha</em>, the term
<em>sammati-saṅgha</em> was used to refer to the <em>bhikkhu-saṅgha</em>.
<em>Sammati-saṅgha</em> means the agreed-upon or authorized sangha, referring
to any gathering of more than three bhikkhus. These terms are often
paired: <em>sāvaka-saṅgha</em> with <em>bhikkhu-saṅgha</em>, and <em>ariya-saṅgha</em> with
<em>sammati-saṅgha</em>. In any case the terms <em>ariya-saṅgha</em> and
<em>sammati-saṅgha</em> do not contradict the older terms and offer a valuable
perspective on the meaning of the word ’sangha’. {411}</p>

<p>{343} The teaching of Buddhism is practical and emphasizes things that
lead to insight and wellbeing.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn40-1"><a href="#fn-fn40">40</a></sup> Buddhism does not encourage
conceptualizing and debating over things that should be realised through
practical application, unless it is necessary for basic understanding.
In relation to the study of Nibbāna, rather than discussing the state of
Nibbāna directly, it may be of more value to study those persons who
have realized Nibbāna, as well as the benefits of realization apparent
in the life and character of such persons.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn41-1"><a href="#fn-fn41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>We can gain some insight into the nature of arahants by looking at the
epithets used for them in the scriptures. Here is a selection of these
epithets, which express appreciation for their virtue, purity,
excellence, and degree of spiritual attainment:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Anuppatta-sadattha:</em> one who has attained wellbeing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Arahant:</em> ’worthy one’; a person far from mental defilement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Asekha:</em> one who has finished training; a person not requiring
training; a person possessing the qualities of an adept
(<em>asekha-dhamma</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kata-karaṇīya:</em> a person who has done what had to be done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Khīṇāsava:</em> a person free from mental taints (<em>āsava</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Mahāpurisa:</em> a person great in virtue; one who acts for the welfare
of the manyfolk; one who has self-mastery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ohitabhāra:</em> one who has laid down the burden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Parama-kusala:</em> a person possessing superior wholesome qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Parikkhīṇa-bhava-saṁyojana:</em> one who has destroyed the fetters
(<em>saṁyojana</em>), which bind people to existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sammadaññā-vimutta:</em> a person released through consummate
knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sampanna-kusala:</em> a person perfected in wholesomeness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Uttama-purisa:</em> a supreme person; a most excellent person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vusitavant <em>or</em> vusita brahmacariya:</em> a person who has fulfilled
the holy life. {344}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many other terms were originally used by other religious traditions, but
their meaning was altered to accord with the essential principles of
Dhammavinaya, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Ariya (<em>or</em> ariya-puggala):</em> a noble person; an excellent person; a
person who has developed non-violence towards all beings.
Originally, this term referred to members of the first three castes
or to those who are ’noble’ (Aryan) by birth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Brāhmaṇa:</em> a ’true brahmin’; a person who has passed beyond evil by
abandoning all unwholesome qualities. Originally, this term referred
to members of the highest caste.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dakkhiṇeyya:</em> one worthy of offerings. Originally, this term
referred to those brahmins who were worthy of a reward for
conducting sacrifices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kevalī <em>or</em> kebalī:</em> a ’whole’ person; a ’complete’ person.
Originally, this term referred to the highest individual in the Jain
religion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nahātaka:</em> one who has been ’ceremoniously bathed’; one who has
’bathed in the Dhamma’; one who has purified his or her volitional
actions (<em>kamma</em>); one who is a refuge for all beings. Originally,
this term referred to a brahmin who passed through a ritual of
bathing and was elevated in status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Samaṇa:</em> a tranquil person; one who has quelled the defilements.
Originally, this term referred to renunciants in general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vedagū:</em> a person who has arrived at knowledge; one who is
well-versed in knowledge and who is released from attachment to
feeling (<em>vedanā</em>). Originally, this term referred to a brahmin who
had finished studying the three Vedas.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn42-1"><a href="#fn-fn42">42</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand the nature of an arahant it is necessary to consider the
epithets in the context of the teachings in which they are mentioned,
for example: the Three Taints (<em>āsava</em>), the Three Trainings (<em>sikkhā</em>),
the Ten Qualities of an Adept (<em>asekha-dhamma</em>), the Ten Fetters
(<em>saṁyojana</em>), and the holy life (<em>brahmacariya</em>) as the Eightfold Path.</p>
<p>Many Buddhists tend to describe the attributes of an arahant and of
other awakened beings from a perspective of negation, by determining
those defilements that have been abandoned or dispelled. For example, a
stream-enterer has eliminated the first three fetters (<em>saṁyojana</em>); a
once-returner has eliminated these three fetters and further attenuated
greed, hatred, and delusion; a non-returner has eliminated the first
five fetters; and an arahant has eliminated all ten fetters.
Alternatively, they define an arahant briefly as ’one who is without
greed, hatred and delusion’ or ’one who is free from defilement’. Such
definitions are useful in that they are clear and provide simple
standards of evaluation. But they are limited; they do not clearly
demonstrate the exceptional characteristics and prominent features of
awakened beings, nor do they describe how such beings live virtuous
lives and benefit the world at large.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many terms and passages describing the
characteristics of an arahant in affirmative ways. Many descriptions or
explanations of arahants, however, cover a wide range of subject
material, making it difficult to summarize the positive attributes in a
clearly defined, well-ordered way. Otherwise, they recount specific
incidents and individuals, but do not describe attributes common to all
arahants.</p>
<p>An important term in this context is <em>bhāvitatta</em>, which is literally
translated as ’one who has developed himself’ or ’one who is
self-developed’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn43-1"><a href="#fn-fn43">43</a></sup> This term is used for all arahants: the Buddha,
the Silent Buddhas (<em>pacceka-buddhā</em>), and all arahant disciples of the
Buddha. For example, in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta, while the Buddha is
travelling to the place of his final passing away, he is referred to as
the ’Developed One’. {345}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Surrounded by and amidst the group of monks, the Buddha travelled to
the river Kakutthā,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn44-1"><a href="#fn-fn44">44</a></sup> and bathed in and drank from its clear,
bright, clean waters…. He travelled to the Mango Grove and said to
the bhikkhu Cundaka: ’Lay out an outer robe folded into four layers
for me to lie upon.’ And thus prompted by the great Adept
(<em>bhāvitatta</em>), Cundaka quickly laid out an outer robe folded into four
layers.</p>
<p><em>D. II. 135.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A similar expression is found in the question by the brahmin student
Mettagū:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Blessed One, I wish to make an inquiry. Please tell me the meaning; I
will thus consider the venerable sir to be a master of knowledge
(<em>vedagū</em>), a fully developed one (<em>bhāvitatta</em>). From where does all this
abundant and diverse suffering in the world come?</p>
<p><em>Sn. 202, in the ’sixteen questions’</em> – soḷasa-pañhā.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha compared a ’fully developed one’ – an arahant who is
well-versed in the Dhamma (<em>bahussuta</em>) – to a clever ship captain, who
is able to guide many people across the seas and reach their destination
in safety, as is illustrated in the Nāvā Sutta:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Just as one who boards a sturdy boat, fully equipped with oars and
barge-pole, who is experienced and skilful, knowing the methods of
helmsmanship, is able to assist many others to cross over the waters,
so too, one who is a master of knowledge (<em>vedagū</em>), a fully developed
one (<em>bhāvitatta</em>), a highly learned one (<em>bahussuta</em>), stable and
unshaken by worldly things, endowed with wisdom, is able to help those
who are prepared to listen, in order to investigate the Dhamma and to
reach fulfilment.</p>
<p><em>Sn. 56.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Loka Sutta is similar to the previous sutta, but covers a broader
subject matter, as is evident from the following passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, these three kinds of persons appearing in the world, appear for
the benefit of many, for the happiness of many, for the compassionate
assistance of the world – for the welfare, the benefit, and the
happiness of devas and human beings. Which three?</p>
<p>Here, the Tathāgata appears in the world. He is the Noble One, the
Fully Enlightened One, perfect in conduct and understanding, the
Accomplished One, the Knower of the worlds, the Peerless Trainer of
those to be trained, Teacher of gods and humans, the Awakened One,
Bestower of the Dhamma. He teaches the Dhamma, beautiful in the
beginning, beautiful in the middle, beautiful in the end; he reveals
the holy life of complete purity, both in spirit and in letter. Monks,
this first kind of person, when appearing in the world, appears for
the benefit of many, for the happiness of many, for the compassionate
assistance of the world – for the welfare, the benefit, and the
happiness of devas and human beings. {346}</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a disciple of that same Teacher who is an
arahant, one whose mind is free from the taints … liberated as a
consequence of thorough knowledge. That disciple teaches the Dhamma,
beautiful in the beginning, beautiful in the middle, beautiful in the
end; he reveals the holy life of complete purity, both in spirit and
in letter. Monks, this is the second kind of person, when appearing in
the world, who appears for the benefit of many, for the happiness of
many, for the compassionate assistance of the world – for the
welfare, the benefit, and the happiness of devas and human beings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a disciple of that same Teacher who is still in
training, still practising, erudite, engaged in virtuous conduct and
practices (<em>sīla-vata</em>). That disciple also teaches the Dhamma,
beautiful in the beginning, beautiful in the middle, beautiful in the
end; he reveals the holy life of complete purity, both in spirit and
in letter. Monks, this is the third kind of person, who when appearing
in the world, appears for the benefit of many, for the happiness of
many, for the compassionate assistance of the world – for the
welfare, the benefit, and the happiness of devas and human beings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Teacher, the Supreme Seeker, is first in the world;<br />
Following him, the disciple, adept (<em>bhāvitatta</em>);<br />
And then the disciple in training (<em>sekha-sāvaka</em>), still

These three kinds of people are supreme<br />
among devas and human beings.<br />
They radiate light, proclaim the truth,<br />
open the door to the Deathless,<br />
And help to liberate the manyfolk from bondage.<br />
Those who follow the noble Path,<br />

<p><em>It. 78-9. Bahujanahita Sutta</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Note, however, that this term <em>bhāvitatta</em> is most often used in poetic
verses, rather than in prose. This is most likely because it is concise
and can be used easily in verse as a replacement for longer, more
drawn-out terms and phrases. Another reason why this short term
<em>bhāvitatta</em> tends not to be used in prose is because its meaning is not
clearly defined. As there are not the same limitations in prose as there
are in poetic composition, longer terms and phrases can be used for the
sake of clarity.</p>
<p>At this point it is useful to ask what terms and phrases are used in
prose instead of the term <em>bhāvitatta</em>. To answer this question let us
look at an explanation found in the Tipiṭaka. The thirtieth volume of
the Tipiṭaka – the Cūḷaniddesa – which is considered to be a
collection of teachings by the ’commander’ and chief disciple Ven.
Sāriputta, elucidates some of the Buddha’s suttas contained in the
Suttanipāta. One passage in the Cūḷaniddesa explains the term
<em>bhāvitatta</em> as it appears in the question by the brahmin student
Mettagū, cited above: {347}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>How is the Blessed One an Adept (<em>bhāvitatta</em>)? Here, the Blessed One
has developed the body (<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>), developed moral conduct
(<em>bhāvita-sīla</em>), developed the mind (<em>bhāvita-citta</em>), developed
wisdom (<em>bhāvita-paññā</em>).</p>
<p>(He has developed the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right
efforts, the four paths to success, the five faculties, the five
powers, the seven factors of enlightenment, the Eightfold Path. He has
abandoned the defilements, penetrated the unshakeable truth, realized
cessation.)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn46-1"><a href="#fn-fn46">46</a></sup></p>

<p>Now let us look at a prose passage by the Buddha describing the four
areas of self-mastery (<em>bhāvita</em>), which are considered an expansion on
the concept of an ’adept’ (<em>bhāvitatta</em>):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these five future dangers as yet unarisen that will
arise in the future. You should recognize them and make an effort to
prevent them. What five?</p>
<p>In the future there will be monks who are undeveloped in body,
morality, mind, and wisdom. Despite being undeveloped in body,
morality, mind, and wisdom, they will give full ordination to others
but will not be able to guide them in higher virtuous conduct
(adhisīla), higher mind (adhicitta), and higher wisdom
(adhipaññā).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn47-1"><a href="#fn-fn47">47</a></sup> These ordainees too will be undeveloped in body,
morality, mind, and wisdom. They in turn will give full ordination to
others but will not be able to guide them in higher virtuous conduct,
higher mind, and higher wisdom. These ordainees too will be
undeveloped in body, morality, mind, and wisdom. Thus, monks, through
corruption of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline, and from
corruption of the discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma. This is
the first future danger as yet unarisen that will arise in the future.
You should recognize it and make an effort to prevent it.</p>
<p>Again, in the future there will be monks who are undeveloped in body,
morality, mind, and wisdom. Despite being undeveloped in body,
morality, mind, and wisdom, they will give dependence<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn48-1"><a href="#fn-fn48">48</a></sup> to others
but will not be able to guide them in higher virtuous conduct, higher
mind, and higher wisdom. These pupils too will be undeveloped in body,
morality, mind, and wisdom. {348} They in turn will give dependence to
others but will not be able to guide them in higher virtuous conduct,
higher mind, and higher wisdom. These pupils too will be undeveloped
in body, morality, mind, and wisdom. Thus, monks, through corruption
of the Dhamma comes corruption of the discipline, and from corruption
of the discipline comes corruption of the Dhamma. This is the second
future danger as yet unarisen that will arise in the future. You
should recognize it and make an effort to prevent it.</p>
<p><em>A. III. 105-106.</em></p>

</div>
<p>This aforementioned teaching by the Buddha is connected to some
essential Dhamma principles:</p>
<p><em>Bhāvitatta</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn49-1"><a href="#fn-fn49">49</a></sup> is a ’word of praise’ (<em>guṇa-pada</em>), a term describing
the virtue or superior quality of the Buddha and the arahants, as those
who have developed themselves and completed their spiritual training.
When one expands on the meaning of this term into the fourfold mastery
of physical development (<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>), moral development
(<em>bhāvita-sīla</em>), mental development (<em>bhāvita-citta</em>), and wisdom
development (<em>bhāvita-paññā</em>), this pertains to the teaching on the four
kinds of cultivation (<em>bhāvanā</em>): cultivation of the body
(<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>), virtuous conduct (<em>sīla-bhāvanā</em>), the mind
(<em>citta-bhāvanā</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā-bhāvanā</em>).</p>
<p>Here, one needs to know some fundamentals of the Pali language. The term
<em>bhāvita</em> is used either as an adjective or an adverb, describing the
qualities of an individual. The term <em>bhāvanā</em>, on the other hand, is a
noun, describing an action, a principle, or a form of practice. There is
a compatibility between these terms in that <em>bhāvita</em> refers to someone
who has fully engaged in <em>bhāvanā</em>. Therefore, one who is developed in
body (<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>) has engaged in physical cultivation
(<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>), one who is developed in virtuous conduct
(<em>bhāvita-sīla</em>) has engaged in moral cultivation (<em>sīla-bhāvanā</em>), one
who is developed in mind (<em>bhāvita-citta</em>) has engaged in mental
cultivation (<em>citta-bhāvanā</em>), and one who is developed in wisdom
(<em>bhāvita-paññā</em>) has engaged in wisdom cultivation (<em>paññā-bhāvanā</em>).</p>
<p>This is equivalent to saying that an arahant is one who has completed
the fourfold cultivation: he or she is accomplished in physical
cultivation, moral cultivation, mental cultivation, and wisdom
cultivation.</p>
<p>To clarify this matter, here is a brief description of the four kinds of
cultivation (<em>bhāvanā</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Physical cultivation (<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>): physical development; to
develop one’s relationship to surrounding material things (including
technology) or to the body itself. In particular, to cognize things
by way of the five faculties (eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body)
skilfully, by relating to them in a way that is beneficial, does not
cause harm, increases wholesome qualities, and dispels unwholesome
qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral cultivation (<em>sīla-bhāvanā</em>): development of virtuous conduct;
to develop one’s behaviour and one’s social relationships, by
keeping to a moral code, by not abusing or injuring others or
causing conflict, and by living in harmony with others and
supporting one another. {349}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental cultivation (<em>citta-bhāvanā</em>): to develop the mind; to
strengthen and stabilize the mind; to cultivate wholesome qualities,
like lovingkindness, compassion, enthusiasm, diligence, and
patience; to make the mind concentrated, bright, joyous, and clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wisdom cultivation (<em>paññā-bhāvanā</em>): to develop and increase wisdom
until there arises a comprehensive understanding of truth, by
knowing things as they are and by gaining a clear insight into the
world and into phenomena. At this stage one is able to free the
mind, purify oneself from mental defilement, and be liberated from
suffering. One lives, acts, and solves problems with penetrative
awareness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When one understands the meaning of <em>bhāvanā</em> (’cultivation’), which
lies at the heart of the aforementioned ways of practice, one also
understands the term <em>bhāvita</em> (’adept’), which is an attribute of those
who have completed their spiritual practice and fulfilled the fours
kinds of cultivation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Physical mastery (<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>): this refers to those who have
developed the body, that is, they have developed a relationship to
their physical environment and to their physical bodies; they have a
healthy, contented, and respectful relationship to things and to
nature; in particular, they experience things by way of the five
senses, say by seeing or hearing, mindfully and in a way that
fosters wisdom. They consume things with moderation, deriving their
true benefit and value. They are not obsessed or led astray by the
influence of preferences and aversions. They are not heedless;
rather than allowing sense stimuli to cause harm, they use them for
benefit; rather than being dominated by unwholesome states of mind,
these individuals nurture wholesome states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral mastery (<em>bhāvita-sīla</em>): this refers to those who have
developed virtuous conduct and developed their behaviour. They act
virtuously in regard to society, by keeping to a moral code and
living harmoniously with others. They do not use physical actions,
speech, or their livelihood to oppress others or to create conflict,
but instead they use these activities for self-development, for
assisting others, and for building a healthy society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mental mastery (<em>bhāvita-citta</em>): this refers to those who have
developed their minds. As a result, their minds are lucid, bright,
spacious, joyous and happy. Their minds are full of virtuous
qualities, like goodwill, compassion, confidence, gratitude,
generosity, perseverance, fortitude, patient endurance,
tranquillity, stability, mindfulness, and concentration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wisdom mastery (<em>bhāvita-paññā</em>): this refers to those who have
trained in and developed wisdom, resulting in an understanding of
the truth and a clear discernment of things according to how they
really are. They apply wisdom to solve problems, to dispel
suffering, and to purify themselves from mental impurities. Their
hearts are liberated and free from affliction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A noteworthy passage in this sutta is where the Buddha states that those
monks who have failed to fully develop their body, virtuous conduct,
mind, and wisdom, will become preceptors and teachers, but will be
unable to guide their pupils in higher virtue, higher mind, and higher
wisdom (i.e. in moral conduct – <em>sīla</em>, concentration – <em>samādhi</em>, and
wisdom – <em>paññā</em>).</p>
<p>It is interesting that, when describing the qualities of a teacher, the
Buddha mentions the four kinds of self-mastery (<em>bhāvita</em>), but when he
describes the subject of study – the teaching or the principles of
practice – he mentions the threefold training, of moral conduct,
concentration, and wisdom. (In full, these are referred to as the
’training in higher virtue’ – <em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>, the ’training in
higher mind’ – <em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>, and the ’training in higher wisdom’
– <em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>.)</p>
<p>This distinction may raise several doubts. First, why doesn’t the Buddha
use complementary or corresponding terms here? Wouldn’t it have made
more sense for him to say that one who is not fully developed
(<em>bhāvita</em>) in the four ways is unable to guide someone else in the
fourfold cultivation (<em>bhāvanā</em>), or conversely, one who has not
completed the threefold training is unable to guide someone else in
moral conduct, concentration, and wisdom? {350}</p>
<p>Moreover, the factors in these teachings are nearly identical. The dual
teaching on cultivation (<em>bhāvanā</em>) and self-mastery (<em>bhāvita</em>)
contains the four factors of body, virtuous conduct, mind, and wisdom.
The Threefold Training, on the other hand, contains the factors of
virtuous conduct, concentration (i.e. ’mind’ – <em>citta</em>), and wisdom.
Therefore, wouldn’t it have been less confusing if the Buddha had stuck
to one or the other of these two teachings, rather than combine them?</p>
<p>Many Buddhists are familiar with the sequence of practice of <em>sīla</em>,
<em>samādhi</em>, and <em>paññā</em>, and this threefold practice is considered to be
complete in itself. They are generally unfamiliar, however, with this
extra factor of ’body’ (<em>kāya</em>), and may wonder why it is added and what
it means.</p>
<p>Here, let us simply conclude that the Buddha presented these two
distinct teachings in the same context: in reference to the attributes
of a teacher he mentioned the fourfold self-mastery (<em>bhāvita</em>), while
in reference to the subject of teaching he mentioned the threefold
training (<em>sikkhā</em>).</p>
<p>A simple, short answer for why the Buddha used these two distinct
teachings in the same context is that they have different objectives or
goals. The teaching on the attributes of a teacher aims to describe the
discernible characteristics of a teacher, in the manner of evaluating
whether someone has completed spiritual training and is ready to teach
others. The teaching on the subject of study on the other hand aims to
describe the content and system of practice – to describe what and how
to train in order to obtain desirable results.</p>
<p>Most importantly, a true study or training entails a natural process of
developing one’s life; this process accords with laws of nature and
therefore the system of training must be established correctly in
harmony with causes and conditions found in nature.</p>
<p>Let us first examine the subject of study, i.e. the threefold training.
Why is this training composed of only three factors? Again, one can
answer this simply by saying that this training pertains to the life of
human beings which has three facets or three spheres of activity. These
three factors combine to make up a person’s life, and they proceed and
are developed in unison.</p>
<p>These three factors are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Communication and interaction with the world:</em> perceptions,
relationships, association, behaviour, and responses vis-à-vis other
people and external objects by way of the <em>dvāra</em> – the doorways or
channels – which can be described in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Doorways of cognition</em> (<em>phassa-dvāra</em>): the eye, ear, nose,
tongue, and body (combined with the meeting point of the mind,
these comprise six doorways).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn50-1"><a href="#fn-fn50">50</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Doorways of volitional action</em> (<em>kamma-dvāra</em>): body and speech
(combined with the meeting point of the mind, these comprise
three doorways).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This factor can be simply called ’interaction with the world’ and
represented by the word <em>sīla</em> (’conduct’).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The mind:</em> the activity of the mind, which has numerous attendant
factors and properties. To begin with, one must have intention, also
referred to as volition, deliberation, determination, or motivation.
Moreover, people’s minds usually contain positive and negative
qualities, strengths and weaknesses. The mind experiences feelings
of pleasure and discomfort, ease and dis-ease, and feelings of
indifference and complacency. There are reactions to these
sensations, like pleasure and aversion, and desires to acquire,
obtain, flee, or get rid of, which influence how one experiences
things and how one acts, for example whether one looks at something
or not, what one chooses to say, and to whom one speaks. This factor
is simply called the ’mind’ (<em>citta</em>) or the domain of concentration
(<em>samādhi</em>). {351}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Wisdom:</em> knowledge and understanding, beginning with <em>suta</em> –
knowledge acquired through formal education or by way of the news
media – up to and including all forms of development in the domain
of thought (<em>cintā-visaya</em>) and the domain of knowledge
(<em>ñāṇa-visaya</em>), including: ideas, views, beliefs, attitudes,
values, attachments to various ideas and forms of understanding, and
specific perspectives and points of view. This factor is called
’wisdom’ (<em>paññā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three factors operate in unison; they are interconnected and
interdependent. A person’s interaction with the world by way of the
sense faculties – by way of the doorways of cognition – and through
physical and verbal behaviour (factor #1) is dependent on intention,
feelings, and various other conditions in the mind (factor #2). And
this entire process is dependent on the guidance by wisdom and
intelligence (factor #3). The extent of one’s knowledge determines the
range of one’s thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>Similarly, the mental factors of say determination and desire (factor
#2) rely on an interaction by way of the sense faculties and physical
and verbal behaviour (factor #1) in order to be fulfilled and
satisfied. And this process is determined and regulated by one’s
beliefs, thoughts, and understanding (factor #3), which are subject to
change and adjustment.</p>
<p>Again, the operation and development of wisdom (factor #3) depends on
the sense faculties, say of seeing or hearing, depends on the movement
of the body, say of walking, organizing, seeking, seizing, etc., and
applies speech to communicate and inquire (factor #1). And this process
relies on mental properties, for example: interest, desire, fortitude,
perseverance, circumspection, mindfulness, tranquillity, and
concentration (factor #2).</p>
<p>The nature of human life consists of these three interrelated,
interdependent factors. They make up an integrated whole, which cannot
be added to or subtracted from. As life consists of these three
factors, any training designed to help people to live their lives well
must address the development of these three areas of life.</p>
<p>Spiritual training is thus divided into three sections, known as the
threefold training. This training is designed to develop these three
areas of life to be complete and in harmony with nature. These three
factors are developed simultaneously and in unison, resulting in an
integrated system of practice.</p>
<p>From a rough perspective one may see these three factors in a similar
way as to how they are sometimes outlined in the scriptures, of
representing three major stages in practice, of moral conduct,
concentration, and wisdom. This perspective gives the appearance that
one practices these factors as distinct steps and in an ordered
sequence, that is, after training in moral conduct one develops
concentration, which is then followed by wisdom development.</p>
<p>By viewing the threefold training in this way one sees a system of
practice in which three factors are prominent at different stages,
beginning with a coarse factor and leading to more refined factors as
one progresses through the stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first stage (moral conduct) gives prominence to the relationship
to one’s external environment, to the sense faculties, and to
physical actions and speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second stage (concentration) gives prominence to a person’s
inner life, to the mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third stage (wisdom) gives prominence to knowledge and
understanding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, however, that at each stage the other two remaining factors always
function and participate. {352}</p>
<p>This perspective provides an overview, in which one focuses on the chief
activity at each stage of the process. One gives prominence to each of
the three factors respectively, so that coarser factors are ready to
support the growth and promote success of more refined factors.</p>
<p>Take for example the task of cutting down a large tree. First, one must
prepare the surrounding area so that one is able to move about easily,
safely, and securely (= <em>sīla</em>). Second, one must prepare one’s
strength, courage, mindfulness, resolve, non-distractedness, and skill
in handling an axe (= <em>samādhi</em>). Third, one must have a proper tool,
like a good quality sharpened axe of the correct size (= <em>paññā</em>). If
one fulfils these three requirements one succeeds in cutting down the
tree.</p>
<p>In regard to one’s regular, daily life, however, a closer analysis
reveals that these three factors are constantly functioning in an
interrelated, interdependent way. Therefore, in order for people to
truly engage in effective spiritual practice, one should encourage them
to be aware of these three factors. They should develop these factors in
unison, by including skilful reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), which
helps to increase understanding, and mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), which helps
to bring about true success.</p>
<p>In terms of one’s spiritual practice, no matter what activity one is
involved in, one is able to inspect and train oneself according to the
principles of the threefold training. One thus aims to engage in all
three of these factors – virtuous conduct, concentration, and wisdom –
simultaneously and in all situations. When involved in an activity, one
considers whether one’s actions result in the affliction or distress of
others, whether they cause harm, or whether they are conducive to
assistance, support, encouragement, and development of others (=
<em>sīla</em>). During such activities, what is the state of one’s mind? Is one
acting out of selfishness, malice, greed, hatred, or delusion, or is one
acting say with kindness, well-wishing, faith, mindfulness, effort, and
a sense of responsibility? While engaged in an activity, is the mind
agitated, anxious, confused, and depressed, or is it calm, happy,
joyous, content, and bright? (= <em>samādhi</em>). When engaged in an activity,
does one act with clear understanding? Does one discern its purpose,
objective and related principles? Does one recognize its potential
benefits and drawbacks, and fully understand the way to adjust and
improve the activity? (= <em>paññā</em>).</p>
<p>In this way skilled persons are able to train and inspect themselves,
and evaluate their practice, at all times and in all situations. They
cultivate all three factors of the threefold training in a single
activity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the development of the threefold training from the
perspective of three distinct stages unfolds automatically. From one
perspective a person develops the threefold training in an ordered
sequence. But from another perspective the simultaneous, unified
practice of these three factors is taking place and assisting in the
successful advancement of the so-called ’three-stage’ training.</p>
<p>In this context, someone who delves deeply into the details of spiritual
practice will know that at the moment of awakening – at the moment of
realizing Path, Fruit, and Nibbāna – all eight factors of the Noble
Path, which are classified into the three groups of <em>sīla</em>, <em>samādhi</em>,
and <em>paññā</em>, are completed and operate as one, acting to eliminate the
defilements and to bring about fulfilment. {353}</p>
<p>To sum up, the system of Buddhist spiritual training – the threefold
training (<em>tisso sikkhā</em>) – is based on a relationship between
requisite factors and accords with specific laws of nature. Human life
consists of three factors – of conduct with the outside world
(<em>sīla</em>), mental activities (<em>citta</em>), and understanding (<em>paññā</em>) –
which act in unison and are interdependent in bringing about spiritual
development.</p>
<p>When describing the principles of spiritual practice, the Buddha
referred to these three aspects of training (<em>sikkhā</em>). We now arrive
back at the question: ’Why did the Buddha adopt a new model of the
fourfold self-mastery (<em>bhāvita</em>) when he described the attributes of a
teacher?’</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, this question can be answered easily by saying
that these two models have different aims and objectives. The threefold
training is to be applied in real life – to be practised in accord with
a system in harmony with nature. The four factors of self-mastery are
intended for self-examination. Here, one need not be concerned with the
order of nature. The emphasis here is on getting a clear picture of
one’s personal qualities. If one discerns these clearly, they will by
their very nature be connected to the three factors of training.</p>
<p>This is obvious by inspecting the first factor of <em>sīla</em>, which refers
to one’s interaction and communication with the world, one’s
apprehension of the world, and one’s actions in relation to the world.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, we interact with the world by way of two sets of
’doorways’ (<em>dvāra</em>): the first set entails the doorways of cognition
(<em>phassa-dvāra</em>), usually referred to as the sense faculties (<em>indriya</em>)
– our awareness of the world by way of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and
body. The second set entails the doorways of volitional action
(<em>kamma-dvāra</em>), through which we act towards and respond to the world
(towards people, towards society, and towards other objects in our
external environment) by physical and verbal gestures.</p>
<p>Here lies the distinction. In regard to interacting with the world, at
any one moment (or to speak at a more refined level, at any one
mind-moment) we only communicate with the world through one of the
specific doorways, and one can examine this process by applying either
of the two sets of doorways.</p>
<p>In respect to the threefold training, in which <em>sīla</em>, <em>samādhi</em> and
<em>paññā</em> are part of an integrated system, the interaction with the world
by way of any one of the various doorways comprises the training in
’conduct’ (<em>sīla</em>); the factors of the mind (<em>samādhi</em>) and
understanding (<em>paññā</em>) constitute distinct factors. The entire
interaction with the world through the various doorways – both the
doorways of cognition and the doorways of volitional action – is
included here in the factor of <em>sīla</em>. For this reason the threefold
training consists of three factors.</p>
<p>In respect to the attributes of a teacher, one need not consider the
integrated functioning of the three factors contained in the threefold
training. Here, one is distinguishing between different factors for the
purpose of investigation. It is precisely here at the factor of conduct
(<em>sīla</em>) where a separation is made, that is, one distinguishes a
person’s interaction with the world according to one or the other of the
two sets of doorways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Doorways of cognition (<em>phassa-dvāra</em>; usually referred to as the
sense faculties – <em>indriya</em>): the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body
(along with the meeting point of the mind, these comprise six
doorways); these doorways enable seeing/looking, hearing/listening,
smelling, tasting, and tangible contact (culminating at the mind as
cognition of mental objects – <em>dhammārammaṇa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doorways of volitional action (<em>kamma-dvāra</em>): body and speech
(along with the meeting point of the mind, these comprise three
doorways); these enable physical actions and speech (and by
designating the starting point of volitional action – the mind –
this also includes thinking).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Buddha separated these two subsidiary factors of conduct (<em>sīla</em>),
determining them as the first two factors in the fourfold self-mastery
(<em>bhāvita</em>). He distinguished the first factor, of interaction with the
world by way of the doorways of cognition or the sense faculties, and
labeled it as ’mastery of the body’ (<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>). (The term ’body’
– <em>kāya</em> – here refers to the ’collection of five doorways’ –
<em>pañcadvārika-kāya</em>). The Buddha thus gave great emphasis to one’s
interaction with the world, in particular to cognition by way of the
five senses. {354} People tend to overlook this first factor, but in
relation to spiritual practice it is considered of paramount importance
in Buddhism, especially in regard to measuring a person’s development.</p>
<p>This is particularly relevant to the present era, which is referred to
as the Age of Information or the IT Age. The development of people in
regard to this factor determines the fork in the road between direct
wisdom cultivation and getting bogged down in delusion. This principle
of ’physical development’ can be used as a sign warning people from
losing their way, and encouraging them to use information technology to
advance civilization in a proper direction.</p>
<p>In terms of measuring people’s spiritual development, the second
subsidiary factor, of interacting with the world by way of the doorways
of volitional action (<em>kamma-dvāra</em>), constitutes ’moral self-mastery’
(<em>bhāvita-sīla</em>), and is equivalent to the second part of the training
in higher virtue (<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>). ’Mental mastery’ (<em>bhāvita-citta</em>)
and ’wisdom mastery’ (<em>bhāvita-paññā</em>) correspond to the training in
higher mind (<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>) and the training in higher wisdom
(<em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>), respectively.</p>
<p>Note that this concept of ’physical mastery’ (<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>), which
here has been defined as a development of one’s interaction with the
world by way of the five sense faculties, is sometimes explained
differently, by defining the term <em>kāya</em> literally as the ’body’ or as
referring to material objects.</p>
<p>If one expands the meaning of <em>bhāvita-kāya</em> in this alternative way,
then the definition of the second factor of ’moral self-mastery’
(<em>bhāvita-sīla</em>) is adjusted accordingly, as follows: ’moral mastery’
refers to the cultivation of one’s relationship to other human beings or
to one’s engagement with society, to promoting peaceful coexistence,
cooperation, harmony, and mutual support.</p>
<p>These alternative definitions of these two factors are connected to the
teaching on fourfold virtuous conduct – on the four kinds of ’pure
conduct classified as virtue’ (<em>pārisuddhi-sīla</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Pāṭimokkhasaṁvara-sīla</em>: virtue as restraint in regard to the
Pāṭimokkha, the chief disciplinary code of the monastic sangha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Indriyasaṁvara-sīla</em>: virtue as sense restraint; to receive sense
impressions, like sights and sounds, mindfully, in a way conducive
to wisdom and true benefit, and not to be dominated by unwholesome
mind states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ājīvapārisuddhi-sīla</em>: virtue as purity of livelihood: to earn
one’s living righteously and in a pure manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paccayapaṭisevana-sīla</em> (or <em>paccayasannissita-sīla</em>): to use the
four requisites wisely, benefiting from them by understanding their
true purpose and value; to live and consume in moderation; not to
consume with craving.</p>

<p>Those aspects pertaining to one’s relationship to the world by way of
the body, or to one’s engagement with material objects and with nature,
are part of the factor on ’physical mastery’ (<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>). Those
aspects pertaining to one’s relationship to society or to one’s
community are part of the factor on ’moral mastery’
(<em>bhāvita-sīla</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn51-1"><a href="#fn-fn51">51</a></sup></p>
<p>Having introduced these principles, the following description of the
attributes of arahants corresponds to the teaching on the fourfold
self-mastery (<em>bhāvita</em>): being fully developed in body, moral conduct,
mind, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Be aware, however, that, although these four kinds of attributes are
distinguished from one another, they are not completely separate. Their
main features are highlighted for the purpose of understanding, but in
the actual process of development they are interconnected and are
cultivated in an integrated way. In particular, they are never
independent from wisdom. {355}</p>

<p>Although there are many passages in the Tipiṭaka in which the Buddha
mentions the term <em>bhāvita-kāya</em>, there are no explicit explanations of
this term, as if the listeners always understood its meaning. There were
occasions, however, when non-Buddhists, especially members of the
Nigaṇṭhā order, spoke about this subject according to their own
understanding, and the Buddha duly responded.</p>
<p>The Mahāsaccaka Sutta, for example, contains an account of such a
conversation, in which the terms <em>bhāvita-kāya</em> and <em>bhāvita-citta</em> are
discussed:</p>
<p>One morning, the famous Nigaṇṭhā named Saccaka (he was a teacher of the
Licchavi princes in Vajjī) travelled to where the Buddha was staying,
and engaged him in conversation. He began by speaking about physical
cultivation (<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>) and mental cultivation (<em>citta-bhāvanā</em>).
He told the Buddha that according to his opinion the Buddha’s disciples
only strive in the area of mental cultivation, but they do not engage in
physical cultivation. The commentaries state that the reason Saccaka
held this view is that he observed the bhikkhus going off in search of
seclusion, but that they did not practise severe austerities.</p>
<p>After he had stated his opinion, the Buddha replied by asking him what,
according to his learning, is the meaning of ’physical cultivation’
(<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>). Saccaka answered by defining it as the practice of
severe austerities and self-mortification (<em>atta-kilamathānuyoga</em>).</p>
<p>The Buddha went on to ask him about his understanding of ’mental
cultivation’ (<em>citta-bhāvanā</em>), yet Saccaka was unable to provide an
explanation. The Buddha continued by saying that Saccaka’s understanding
of physical cultivation is incompatible with the cultivation as found in
the noble ones’ discipline (<em>ariya-vinaya</em>). Failing to understand the
meaning of physical cultivation, how could one possibly understand
mental cultivation? He then bid Saccaka to listen to his explanation on
what is not physical and mental cultivation, and conversely, what is
truly physical and mental cultivation:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>How, Aggivessana,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn52-1"><a href="#fn-fn52">52</a></sup> has one gained mastery in body and mastery in
mind? Here, pleasant feeling arises in a well-taught noble disciple.
Although touched by that pleasant feeling, he does not lust after
pleasure, he does not become one who lusts after pleasant feeling.
That pleasant feeling of his ceases. With the cessation of the
pleasant feeling, painful feeling arises. Touched by that painful
feeling, he does not sorrow, snivel, and lament; he does not weep
beating his breast and become distraught.</p>
<p>In this way, Aggivessana, although that pleasant feeling has arisen in
him, it does not invade his mind and remain, because the body is
developed. And although that painful feeling has arisen in him, it
does not invade his mind and remain, because the mind is developed.</p>
<p>Look here, Aggivessana, any noble disciple in whom, in this double
manner, arisen pleasant feeling does not invade his mind and remain
because the body is developed, and arisen painful feeling does not
invade his mind and remain because the mind is developed, has gained
mastery in body and in mind.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn53-1"><a href="#fn-fn53">53</a></sup> {356}</p>
<p><em>M. I. 237.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As mentioned above, the principal meaning of ’physical cultivation’
(<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>) is the development of the ’collection of five doorways’
(<em>pañcadvārika-kāya</em>), that is, of the five faculties (<em>indriya</em>): the
eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. Therefore, ’physical cultivation’
(<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>) is essentially identical to the cultivation of the
sense faculties (<em>indriya-bhāvanā</em>).</p>
<p>The development of the sense faculties begins with sense restraint
(<em>indriya-saṁvara</em>), to which the Buddha gave great emphasis in the
training for those who have ’gone forth’ in the Dhammavinaya. Sense
restraint is a fundamental practice, linked with the training in
virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>). (In the commentaries, sense restraint is
often classified as a form of virtuous conduct, as ’virtue as sense
restraint’ – <em>indriyasaṁvara-sīla</em>.) Let us have a look at this basic
principle:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And how, Sire, is a monk called a guardian of the sense doors? Here a
monk, on seeing a visible object with the eye, does not grasp at its
major signs or secondary characteristics. Because the evil,
unwholesome states of covetousness (abhijjhā) and indignation
(domanassa) would overwhelm him if he dwelt leaving this eye-faculty
unrestrained, so he practises guarding it, he protects the
eye-faculty, develops restraint of the eye-faculty. On hearing a sound
with the ear … on smelling an odour with the nose … on tasting a
flavour with the tongue … on feeling a tangible with the body … on
knowing a mind object with the mind, he does not grasp at its major
signs or secondary characteristics … he develops restraint of the
mind-faculty. That monk endowed with this noble sense restraint
experiences within himself pure, unadulterated happiness. In this way,
Sire, a monk is a guardian of the sense doors.</p>
<p><em>D. I. 70.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Sense restraint still belongs to the practice of a ’trainee’, or is a
rudimentary stage of practice. It is not a necessary practice for an
arahant, who has ’gained mastery over the sense faculties’
(<em>bhāvitindriya</em>, which is classified as part of <em>bhāvita-kāya</em>). It is
included in the discussion here, however, to demonstrate the various
stages of practice.</p>
<p>There is a more profound form of sense restraint, or another way of
explaining this term, as is evident from a discussion the Buddha had
with the wanderer Kuṇḍaliya at Añjanavana in Sāketa. (The cultivation of
this form of sense restraint fulfils the three kinds of good conduct –
<em>sucarita</em>; the cultivation of the three kinds of good conduct fulfils
the Four Foundations of Mindfulness; the cultivation of the Four
Foundations of Mindfulness fulfils the seven factors of enlightenment;
the cultivation of the seven factors of enlightenment fulfils true
knowledge and deliverance, the highest blessing):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And how, Kuṇḍaliya, is restraint of the sense faculties developed and
cultivated so that it fulfils the three kinds of good conduct? Here,
Kuṇḍaliya, having seen an agreeable form with the eye, a monk does not
long for it, or become excited by it, or generate lust for it. His
body is steady and his mind is steady, inwardly well-composed and
well-liberated. Moreover, having seen a disagreeable form with the
eye, he is not dismayed by it, not resistant, not afflicted, not
resentful. His body is steady and his mind is steady, inwardly
well-composed and well-liberated. Further, having heard an agreeable
sound with the ear … having smelt an agreeable odour with the nose
… having savoured an agreeable taste with the tongue … having felt
an agreeable tangible with the body … having cognized an agreeable
mental phenomenon with the mind, a monk does not long for it. … his
mind is steady, inwardly well-composed and well-liberated. In this
way, Kuṇḍaliya, is restraint of the sense faculties developed and
cultivated so that it fulfils the three kinds of good conduct.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn54-1"><a href="#fn-fn54">54</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 74.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Now let us examine a higher stage of practice – the cultivation of the
sense faculties (<em>indriya-bhāvanā</em>) – which is described in the
Indriyabhāvanā Sutta. After describing this form of practice, this sutta
also distinguishes between the term <em>sekha-pāṭipada</em>, referring to an
awakened person who is still a trainee, and the term <em>bhāvitindriya</em>,
referring to an arahant, who has completed his or her spiritual training
and is ’fully developed in body’ (<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>): {357}</p>
<p>On one occasion the Buddha was staying at the bamboo grove in Kajaṅgala,
and he was visited by Uttara, a disciple of the brahmin Pārāsariya.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn55-1"><a href="#fn-fn55">55</a></sup>
The Buddha asked him whether Pārāsariya taught the cultivation of the
sense faculties (<em>indriya-bhāvanā</em>) to his disciples. When Uttara
replied that he did, the Buddha asked him in what manner does he teach
on developing the sense faculties. Uttara replied that Pārāsariya
teaches to avoid having the eye see material forms and having the ear
hear sounds. The Buddha answered that following this line of reasoning a
blind or deaf person has ’mastered the sense faculties’
(<em>bhāvitindriya</em>).</p>
<p>The Buddha went on to say that the development of the senses as taught
by Pārāsariya is different from the supreme cultivation of the senses in
the discipline of the noble ones (<em>ariya-vinaya</em>). Ven. Ānanda then
asked the Buddha to explain this supreme cultivation of the senses:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>1. The cultivation of the sense faculties (indriya-bhāvanā):</em></p>
<p>Now, Ānanda, how is there the supreme development of the faculties in
the noble ones’ discipline? Here, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu sees a form
with the eye, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what
is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable.
He clearly understands thus: ’There has arisen in me what is
agreeable, there has arisen what is disagreeable, there has arisen
what is both agreeable and disagreeable. But that is conditioned,
gross, dependently arisen. This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is,
equanimity.’ The agreeable that arose, the disagreeable that arose,
and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose cease in him and
equanimity is well established. Just as a man with good sight, having
opened his eyes might shut them or having shut his eyes might open
them, so too in a monk, the agreeable that arose, the disagreeable
that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that arose ceases
and equanimity is established just as quickly, just as rapidly, just
as easily. This is called in the noble ones’ discipline the supreme
development of the faculties regarding forms cognizable by the eye.</p>
<p>Again, Ānanda, when a monk hears a sound with the ear … smells an
odour with the nose … tastes a flavour with the tongue … touches a
tangible with the body … cognizes a mind-object with the mind …
equanimity is well established. Just as if a man were to let two or
three drops of water fall onto an iron frying pan heated for a whole
day, the falling of the drops might be slow but they would quickly
vaporize and vanish, so too in a monk, the agreeable that arose, the
disagreeable that arose, and the both agreeable and disagreeable that
arose ceases and equanimity is established just as quickly, just as
rapidly, just as easily. This is called in the noble ones’ discipline
the supreme development of the faculties regarding mind objects
cognizable by the mind.</p>
<p>That is how there is the supreme development of the faculties in the
noble ones’ discipline.</p>
<p><em>2. A) One who is still in training (sekha-pāṭipada):</em></p>
<p>And how, Ānanda, is one a disciple in higher training, one who is
still engaged in practice? Here, Ānanda, when a bhikkhu sees a form
with the eye, there arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what
is disagreeable, there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable;
he is discomforted, disquieted and disgusted by the agreeable that
arose, by the disagreeable that arose, and by the both agreeable and
disagreeable that arose. When a monk hears a sound with the ear …
smells an odour with the nose … tastes a flavour with the tongue …
touches a tangible with the body … cognizes a mind-object with the
mind … he is discomforted, disquieted and disgusted by the agreeable
that arose, by the disagreeable that arose, and by the both agreeable
and disagreeable that arose. {358} That is how one is a disciple in
higher training, one who is still engaged in practice.</p>
<p><em>2. B) One who has completed the training (bhāvitindriya):</em></p>
<p>And how, Ānanda, is one a noble one with fully developed faculties?
Here, Ānanda, when a monk sees a form with the eye, there arises in
him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable, there arises
what is both agreeable and disagreeable. If he should wish: ’May I
abide perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive’, he abides
perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive. If he should wish: ’May I
abide perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive’, he abides
perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive. If he should wish: ’May I
abide perceiving the unrepulsive in what is both repulsive and
unrepulsive’, he abides perceiving the unrepulsive in that. If he
should wish: ’May I abide perceiving the repulsive in what is both
unrepulsive and repulsive’, he abides perceiving the repulsive in
that. If he should wish: ’May I avoiding both the repulsive and
unrepulsive, abide in equanimity, mindful and fully aware’, he abides
in equanimity towards that, mindful and fully aware.</p>
<p>Again, Ānanda, when a monk hears a sound with the ear … smells an
odour with the nose … tastes a flavour with the tongue … touches a
tangible with the body … cognizes a mind-object with the mind, there
arises in him what is agreeable, there arises what is disagreeable,
there arises what is both agreeable and disagreeable…. If he should
wish: ’May I avoiding both the repulsive and unrepulsive, abide in
equanimity, mindful and fully aware’, he abides in equanimity towards
that, mindful and fully aware.</p>
<p>That is how one is a noble one with fully developed faculties.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn56-1"><a href="#fn-fn56">56</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. III. 298 (abridged)</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As mentioned earlier, by expanding on their meanings or by changing the
focus of investigation, there are alternative definitions for the terms
<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em> and <em>bhāvita-kāya</em>. Instead of focusing on the doorways
of cognition or on the sense faculties, the focus shifts to the world at
large or to external objects which come into contact with the senses –
the objects of cognition. One then distinguishes between these various
sense objects. By doing this the definition of ’physical development’
becomes the development of one’s relationship to one’s surroundings by
way of one’s physical body, or the development of one’s relationship to
material things (including other human beings in their capacity as
objects of cognition).</p>
<p>One group of objects that people engage with to a great degree are the four requisites (<em>paccaya</em>): food, clothing, shelter,
and medicine. By extension this group also includes all the other
material things, consumable objects, tools and appliances used in work,
etc., which comprise a large part of our interaction with the outside
world. This area of a person’s life requires discipline and training, as
one can see from the teaching on moral conduct related to a wise use
of the four requisites (<em>paccayapaṭisevana-sīla</em>). A wise use of
material requisites, like sense restraint, may thus be included in the
factor of physical development (<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>).</p>
<p>In the Dhammavinaya, the relationship to material things that nourish
and sustain life is considered an essential part of training. People are
able to develop this relationship constantly in everyday life. This form
of training is set down from the onset for those individuals ordained as
monks and nuns, of reflecting wisely on the use of the four requisites,
and by developing a sense of moderation, which leads to contentment and
generates true blessings. This stands in contrast to consuming things
with only a foggy understanding and seeking to gratify one’s craving:
{359}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Cunda, I do not teach you the Dhamma for restraining the taints that
arise in the present alone. Nor do I teach the Dhamma merely for
preventing taints from arising in the future. Rather, I teach the
Dhamma to both restrain present taints and to prevent future taints
from arising.</p>
<p>Therefore, Cunda, let the robe I have allowed you be simply for
protection from cold, for protection from heat, for protection from
contact with the wind and sun, from horseflies, mosquitoes, and
creeping things, and only for the purpose of concealing the private
parts and protecting your modesty.</p>
<p>Let the almsfood I have allowed you be just enough for the support and
sustenance of the body, for avoiding [malnourishment leading to]
distress, and for assisting the holy life, considering: ’Thus I shall
terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings and I shall be
healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort.’</p>
<p>Let the lodging I have allowed you be simply for protection from cold,
for protection from heat, for protection from contact with the wind
and sun, from horseflies, mosquitoes, and creeping things, and only
for the purpose of allaying the perils of climate and for the
enjoyment of seclusion.</p>
<p>Let the medicinal requisites that I have allowed you be just for
warding off feelings that have arisen resulting from illness, and for
the benefit of being free from afflicting disease.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn57-1"><a href="#fn-fn57">57</a></sup></p>
<p><em>D. III. 129-30.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Of these four requisites, lodging (<em>senāsana</em>; literally ’place for
sitting and lying down’) is highly significant, both as a residence and
as a place for storing the other requisites. Most human actions, whether
it be the preparation, consumption, or storage of food, or the place for
keeping one’s clothes and getting dressed, occur in one’s lodging or
abode. In respect to offering gifts, the Buddha said:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Giving food and drink, one gives strength;<br />
Giving clothes, one gives beauty;<br />
Giving a vehicle, one gives ease and comfort;<br />
Giving a lamp, one gives sight.<br />
The one who gives a residence is the giver of all.<br />
But the one who teaches the Dhamma<br />
Is the giver of the Deathless.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 32.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>For the monastic community, the ’residence’ encompasses all buildings,
from personal monastic huts (<em>kuṭī</em>) to communal buildings, which
comprise individual monasteries, originally referred to by the Buddha as
<em>ārāma</em> (’park’, ’grove’). These monasteries developed from forested
areas: from woodlands (<em>vana</em>) and royal parks (<em>uyyāna</em>). The first
Buddhist monastery, offered by King Bimbisāra to the Buddha, was
Veḷuvanaṁ Uyyānaṁ – the ’Bamboo Grove and Royal Park’, and the
monastery in which the Buddha spent the most amount of time was Jetavana
Royal Park, later called Jetavana Grove.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn58-1"><a href="#fn-fn58">58</a></sup> {360}</p>
<p>From monasteries in smaller woodlands on the outskirts of towns and
villages, or those bordering larger forests, the meaning of monastic
residences was expanded to incorporate places deep in the forest
(<em>arañña</em>), including caves, steep ravines, and mountains. Eventually
the concept of ’residence’ (<em>senāsana</em>) for the monastic community came
to encompass the entire range of forests, mountains, and inhabited
areas, until it meant one’s entire environment – the whole world.</p>
<p>One’s residence, region of habitation, and entire environment is
equivalent to those things in one’s surrounding with which one comes
into contact, associates, engages, and relates by way of the five
senses. Therefore the world around us is the domain for ’physical
development’ (<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>) – for training the body, for training
one’s interaction with the outside world by way of the sense faculties.</p>
<p>A favourable relationship to one’s residence, which is maintained
continuously by accomplished practitioners, is evinced by the terms used
to describe monastic residences above, and it is connected to a healthy
relationship generally in spiritual practice to the world at large. This
is evident from the first term used to describe a monastery: <em>ārāma</em>,
which can be translated as ’park’, and literally means ’place of
delight’.</p>
<p>This term <em>ārāma</em> points to a fundamental aspect of a Dhamma
practitioner’s relationship to the world, beginning with a person’s
residence (in the case of monks and nuns this refers to a monastery), as
being a place inspiring delight (for example, it is in a natural
surrounding, with plants and animals). This term reveals the desirable
mind state that a monastic or a Dhamma practitioner should maintain in
relation to a suitable residence, which can then be extended to any
place or region where one lives – making it a place of delight.</p>
<p>This is not all. The term <em>ārāma</em> connects people to their fundamental
state of existence and way of practice. It connects us to the domain of
sense experience – to the mind. Here, one’s ’abode’ or ’abiding’ is one
of delight, which we see revealed in various Dhamma principles, for
example: solitude as a place of delight (<em>pavivekārāma</em>); seclusion as a
place of delight (<em>paṭisallānārāma</em>); the relinquishment of unwholesome
qualities as a delightful abiding (<em>pahānārāma</em>); and the cultivation of
wholesome qualities as a delightful abiding (<em>bhāvanārāmā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn59-1"><a href="#fn-fn59">59</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Ārāma</em> here refers to a favourable feeling or attitude towards a
suitable object with which one comes into contact. It is as if Dhamma
practitioners have a responsibility to make those things they engage
with a source of delight, beginning with one’s lodging or residence
(which for monks is already called an <em>ārāma</em>), and then extending this
feeling outward into their general environment.</p>
<p>In reference to people’s relationship to their abodes and surrounding
environment, besides the term <em>ārāma</em>, another term (used probably more
often than <em>ārāma</em>) that is often used in the context of the lives of
monks, Dhamma practitioners, and arahants is <em>ramaṇīya</em>, translated as
’delightful’, ’refreshing’, ’pleasant’. This term points to an inspiring
surrounding atmosphere, which is extremely favourable for practitioners
and conducive to the development of wholesome mind states. For arahants,
accessing this delightful atmosphere is easy or happens readily, because
their contact with the world occurs without any hidden defilements.
Moreover, arahants are able to make their surroundings delightful and
refreshing, both for themselves and for those who dwell close to them.</p>
<p>The term <em>ramaṇīya</em> appears frequently in the Tipiṭaka, and it is as if
this atmosphere of delight or refreshment is a feature of the Tipiṭaka
itself. We see it expressed, for example, already in the story of the
Buddha’s life before he was awakened, when as a bodhisatta he went in
search of a suitable place to practise meditation and finally found such
a location at Uruvelā: {361}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’This is a truly delightful (<em>ramaṇīyo vata</em>) piece of ground with
sheltered, pleasant groves and a clear-flowing river with smooth banks
and nearby a village for alms resort. This will indeed serve for the
striving of a clansman intent on striving.’ And I sat down there
thinking: ’This will serve for striving.’</p>
<p><em>M. I. 167.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>There are records of the Buddha and his disciples, when they stayed at
or passed through various places, especially forests and mountains,
describing these places as delightful. Sometimes these descriptions are
detailed, like in the case of Ven. Ekavihāriya Thera, who described in
verse his place of solitude:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>While a refreshing breeze blows,<br />
Laden with the fragrance of flowers,<br />
I’ll burst asunder ignorance<br />
While seated on the mountain top.<br />
In the mountain heights carpeted with flowers,<br />
A region cool and forested,<br />
Gladdened by the joy of release,<br />
I will delight in the great mountain caves.</p>
<p><em>Thag. verses 544-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When Ven. Mahā Kassapa returned from collecting alms and climbed into
the mountains, he uttered a long verse praising the beauty of the
forested landscape, including these passages:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Garlanded with sacred pear,<br />
Echoing with the trumpet calls of elephants,<br />
These uplifting crags are a place of delight;<br />
These mountains do please me so!<br />
Dark-hued like thunderheads, these marvellous mountains,<br />
With cool, clear streams and covered by meadows,<br />
The colour of gold-dust beetles –<br />
These mountains do please me so!<br />
These myrtle peaks majestic as clouds,<br />
Appearing like palaces;<br />
Resounding with the lovely bellows of tuskers –<br />
These mountains do please me so!</p>
<p><em>Thag. verses 1062-64.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>To sum up, arahants have completely developed their sense faculties
(<em>bhāvitindriya</em>). Besides being able to immediately savour a delightful
environment, they are able to perceive or relate to an unpleasant
physical surrounding as pleasant. They delight in pleasant places
without hindrance, and they transform chaotic, troublesome places into
an oasis. Those who come into contact with them share in this delight:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Whether in village or in forest,<br />
On hill or in dale,<br />
Wherever arahants dwell –<br />
Delightful, indeed, is that spot.</p>
<p><em>Dh. verse 98.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The cultivation of the body (<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>) begins with initial stages
of practice and truly reaches fulfilment when practice is complete –
when a person realizes the fruit of wisdom cultivation. When practice is
complete, the aspect of physical self-mastery (<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>) is
conspicuous and easily apparent to others. Having said this, however,
there are other similar results of awakening that can potentially be
misleading to ordinary people, who have not developed themselves in
body, virtue, mind, and wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn60-1"><a href="#fn-fn60">60</a></sup> {362}</p>
<h3 id="moral-self-mastery-bhāvita-sīla"><a class="header" href="#moral-self-mastery-bhāvita-sīla">Moral Self-Mastery (bhāvita-sīla)</a></h3>
<p>Moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>) is a beginning stage of spiritual practice and is
perfected at the level of stream-entry (<em>sotāpanna</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn61-1"><a href="#fn-fn61">61</a></sup> It is
impossible for someone who has realized liberation to act immorally
(<em>dussīla</em>) or to deliberately cause harm.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn62-1"><a href="#fn-fn62">62</a></sup> For this reason, there
are few scriptural references to the moral conduct of awakened beings.
The matter to be discussed here is thus restricted to how arahants
conduct their lives and act within society.</p>
<p>Arahants have brought ’kamma’ to cessation<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn63-1"><a href="#fn-fn63">63</a></sup>; they have ended
kamma.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn64-1"><a href="#fn-fn64">64</a></sup> Their actions are no longer referred to as kamma – the
technical term for their actions is <em>kiriyā</em> (’doing’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn65-1"><a href="#fn-fn65">65</a></sup> Ignorance,
craving and clinging do not control their actions; they act with a free
mind and with wisdom, clearly understanding cause and effect. They do
not cling to ideas of right or wrong, which for other people are
connected to a sense of personal identity and gain. They have no hidden
personal desires; they have no conceit about ’my virtue’ or ’my good
deeds’, for example. They act objectively, reasonably and correctly.
They transcend bad kamma, since there is no more greed, hatred or
delusion that could lead to harm or evil, and they also transcend good
kamma.</p>
<p>One may pose the question that all actions require a motivating force
and that the crucial motivation is desire (which is a form of craving –
<em>taṇhā</em>). How is it possible for arahants to act when they have
abandoned craving? Surely they remain passive and idle. Although they do
no bad deeds, they also do no good deeds. An answer to this question is
that desire is not the only motivating force for action. Reasoned
consideration is also a motivating force.</p>
<p>The flow of human life is dependent upon dynamic forces. Unless other
factors interfere, the way we live our lives is directed by knowledge. A
lack of knowledge gives craving the opportunity to distort or dictate
life’s course. These two forces, of selfish desire and reasoned
understanding, are often in conflict with one another. At times
selfishness has the upper hand, at other times sound judgement prevails.
When a person is released from the controlling power or ’furtive
whispering’ of craving, life progresses without restraint, in harmony
with wisdom. Wisdom becomes the motivating force.</p>
<p>Craving does not just dictate action; it can also hinder action when
knowledge encourages us to act. {363} Craving therefore can be a
motivating force for action and for inaction. Inaction in such a case is
a kind of action: an act of inaction. Craving can have many functions:
it can direct, coerce, or impede. When a wholesome action is not
performed, say a student is disinterested in lessons or people do not
help one another, we should not merely consider the absence of a
motivating force for action. We should also reflect on the motivation
for inaction: to take into account the craving, which comes in the form
of laziness, aversion, or pleasure directed towards other objects, and
has a greater pull on attention. A habitual dependence on craving
creates a secondary struggle, between the urge to act and the urge not
to act. Whichever selfish motivation is stronger wins. When wisdom is
the dominant motivation this struggle is absent.</p>
<p>Through a profound analysis, one recognizes another dynamic. As soon as
wisdom understands according to reasoned judgement whether to act or to
refrain from acting, an additional force arises in the mind which
propels one to action or to restraint. This force can be referred to as
a form of desire, or as a motivation, which will be discussed at more
length below.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn66-1"><a href="#fn-fn66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>Above, the concepts of craving as a motivation and of wisdom as a
motivation were introduced. At first glance these two kinds of
motivation seem to be at opposites. Although this subject is covered in
another chapter, it is relevant to the current topic and thus deserves a
basic explanation.</p>
<p>Simply speaking, human beings have two kinds of motivation. The first
kind is driven by craving and is based on our feelings. It consists
of desires, wishes, and needs that follow sensation. If something is
pleasurable, one wants to acquire it; if something is delicious, one
wants to savour it. This kind of desire requires no knowledge of whether
the object of desire is correct or incorrect, beneficial or harmful.</p>
<p>The second kind of motivation springs from wisdom. This consists of
desires, wishes, and needs that accord with reasoned understanding and a
true comprehension of what is correct. For example, one sees a road that
is cracking, filthy, obstructed, or slippery. One knows that according
to its real purpose and value, such a thoroughfare should be clean,
smooth, and safe. When one sees the road in such a damaged state, one
wishes to repair and clear it. In contrast with the motivation of
craving, this second kind is called the ’motivation of wholesome
enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>)’.</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> refers to desires, wishes, and needs that are in line with
reality (<em>sabhāva</em>). One wishes for something to be as good, fine,
complete, upright or fulfilled as it naturally should be. This is
independent of one’s likes and dislikes, or of wanting to either acquire
the object or wanting it to disappear, in order to satisfy one’s
personal sentiments. {364} Indeed, the desire of wholesome enthusiasm is
cultivated alongside the development of wisdom.</p>
<p>When this form of desire, of wanting things to exist in an ideal,
natural state, extends outwards in relation to other human beings, it
manifests as a wish for others to be well, complete, strong, bright,
respected, and happy. Moreover, one wants them to be established in
righteousness, established in Dhamma, free from faults and shortcomings.</p>
<p>The Buddha gave great emphasis to human relationships. In this context,
according to the circumstances, wholesome enthusiasm vis-à-vis others is
expanded into four different kinds: lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>) – the wish
for others to be happy under normal circumstances; compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>)
– the wish to help others in times of trouble and distress, to help
them escape from suffering; appreciative joy (<em>muditā</em>) – well-wishing,
the desire for others to increase in happiness and success; and
equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>) – the wish for others to be established in
righteousness, in truth, in a freedom from defect and harm.</p>
<p>Compassion is especially prominent in those people who have reached
Nibbāna, who are completely free and happy. Freedom of action based on
wisdom, or a motivational force stemming from wisdom, allows for the
strength of wholesome desire in the form of compassion to be expressed
to the full. Compassion is a key quality of the Buddha and the arahants.</p>
<p>For a person endowed with general humanitarian qualities, compassion
arises automatically when encountering someone else who is suffering.
This compassion, however, is contingent on an inner freedom and an
understanding of things as they are. In that moment one is not dominated
by ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>), craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), and grasping (<em>upādāna</em>),
for example: one is not acting out of personal gain; one is free of
selfish concerns; and one does not find pleasure in others’ misfortune
which answers to a secret wish to inflate one’s sense of self.</p>
<p>When the heart is not oppressed, it becomes expansive and is fully
sensitive to the suffering of others. There is empathy, understanding,
and a wish to free others from suffering. If craving does not interfere
(as self-concern, a fear of losing an advantage, or laziness, for
instance), life will be guided by wisdom and the wish to help others
will transform into compassionate action.</p>
<p><em>Chanda</em> is the desire of those whose minds are clear and free, who are
ready to truly receive other people, responding to them with an
understanding of their suffering. And their altruistic intentions, of
wanting other people to be released from suffering, are readily extended
outwards into active deeds of compassionate assistance.</p>
<p>This all-embracing compassion, of wanting to assist others and free them
from suffering, is a potent force in the lives of those who have
realized Nibbāna, for whom no lingering sense of a ’self’ – no fixed
identity – remains which needs to be protected and gratified. {365}</p>
<p>In sum, true compassion results from wisdom and liberation. The specific
term for wisdom in this context is <em>vijjā</em> and the specific term for
liberation is <em>vimutti</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Vijjā</em>: comprehensive knowledge of reality that allows no room for
a belief in ’self’ (<em>attā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vimutti</em>: liberation; freedom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Karuṇā</em>: compassion; expansiveness of the heart; responsiveness to
the suffering of beings; the wish to console others and promote
their liberation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three qualities are the opposite of:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Avijjā</em>: ignorance of the truth, leading to the obstruction of
’self’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Taṇhā</em>: craving; the desire to compensate for the inadequacy of the
’self’ or to reinforce the idea of ’self’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Upādāna</em>: tenacious clinging to things when it is judged that these
things will profit the ’self’ or will lead to personal prestige and
power.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Arahants have abandoned ignorance, craving and clinging. They possess
wisdom as a beacon for action and compassion as a motivating force. If
the sole motivation for action were to be craving, then benevolent
assistance could never be true or pure. By the same token, as long as
assistance to others is motivated by craving, it is not true compassion.</p>
<p>Craving (including ignorance and clinging) is a hazardous motivating
force and causes us to be blind to our own and others’ wellbeing. Even
if we consider such wellbeing, our vision is distorted; we do not truly
understand what is advantageous and disadvantageous. What is beneficial
is seen as detrimental and what is detrimental is seen as beneficial.
Craving in the form of lust, anger and delusion overwhelms the mind, or
as the five hindrances (<em>nīvaraṇa</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn67-1"><a href="#fn-fn67">67</a></sup> it obstructs the functioning of
the mind. When there are no such defilements, the mind is calm and
bright; it is able to recognize true benefit.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn68-1"><a href="#fn-fn68">68</a></sup></p>
<p>Arahants are able to assist others in a fully compassionate way because
they have fulfilled their own state of wellbeing. They have ’attained
personal wellbeing’ (<em>anuppatta-sadattha</em>) and they have ’done what had
to be done’ (<em>kata-karaṇīya</em>). When personal matters (<em>attattha</em>) are
finalized, personal wellbeing is complete (<em>attahita-sampatti</em>); one is
inwardly complete and need no longer worry about oneself. A person is
then able to fully attend to the wellbeing and concerns of others
(<em>parattha</em>), and live life by benefiting others
(<em>parahita-paṭipatti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn69-1"><a href="#fn-fn69">69</a></sup> With such fulfilment arahants have acquired
the qualities of being a ’friend to all’ (<em>sabba-mitta</em>), a ’companion
to all’ (<em>sabba-sakhi</em>), and ’kind-hearted toward all beings’
(<em>sabba-bhūtānukampaka</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn70-1"><a href="#fn-fn70">70</a></sup> {366}</p>
<p>The word <em>attha</em> (translated above as ’wellbeing’) here does not refer
to the usual meaning as an ’advantage’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn71-1"><a href="#fn-fn71">71</a></sup> It refers instead to true
benefit, to the most important aspect of a person’s life, in particular
to personal attributes that promote prosperity, maturity,
resourcefulness, and self-reliance. (This stands in contrast to
so-called personal benefits which often cause harm, for instance eating
delicious food but to great excess.) The main purpose of this ’inner
wealth’ is to develop virtue, specifically wisdom, and to lead to
freedom from the controlling power of ignorance, craving and clinging.</p>
<p>The conduct of arahants can be divided into two categories: work and
personal activities. In regard to work, arahants tend to be leaders.
They fulfil their responsibilities as Buddhist disciples in an optimum
way, since they have escaped from the constrictive ’noose’ of
defilements. The responsibility of Buddhist disciples is revealed
clearly in the Buddha’s repeated instruction, which he gave when he sent
disciples out to proclaim the teachings during the first year of his
ministry: to act for the welfare and happiness of the many
(<em>bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya</em>), for the compassionate assistance of
the world (<em>lokānukampāya</em>), and for the wellbeing, support and
happiness of gods and human beings (<em>atthāya hitāya sukhāya
devamanussānaṁ</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn72-1"><a href="#fn-fn72">72</a></sup> These qualities are significant objectives of the
holy life (<em>brahmacariya</em>);<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn73-1"><a href="#fn-fn73">73</a></sup> they are the criteria of behaviour and
practice for bhikkhus;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn74-1"><a href="#fn-fn74">74</a></sup> and they are the virtues present in persons
who are considered supreme according to the Buddhist teachings.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn75-1"><a href="#fn-fn75">75</a></sup>
They are therefore constant considerations for a Buddhist disciple when
performing duties and work.</p>
<p>The principal work of arahants is to provide instruction to promote
mindfulness, wisdom, and other spiritual qualities, and to act as a role
model for a happy and virtuous life. Later generations can take these
persons as examples to live up to (<em>diṭṭhānugati</em>: ’following a clear
example’). It is fair to say that teaching others is an arahant’s
obligation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn76-1"><a href="#fn-fn76">76</a></sup></p>
<p>A similar standard – of seeking the welfare of all – holds true
regarding arahants’ personal conduct. Although arahants have ’finished
their business’, and once they have realized Nibbāna they may abandon
those practices that were undertaken for realization, they frequently
conduct themselves as before. On a personal level this is for abiding at
ease in the present (<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>), and in relation to
others it is for compassionate assistance to later generations
(<em>pacchimā-janatānukampā</em>) by providing a good example. Illustrations of
this latter motive include the Buddha’s abiding in forest
dwellings,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn77-1"><a href="#fn-fn77">77</a></sup> and Ven. Mahā Kassapa Thera’s observance of the austere
practices (<em>dhutaṅga</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn78-1"><a href="#fn-fn78">78</a></sup> {367} Even those community elders who have
not realized Nibbāna emphasize acting as an example for later
generations.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn79-1"><a href="#fn-fn79">79</a></sup> For an arahant, the ideal human being, such
responsibility in this area is exceptional. Note also that some of the
rules of discipline (<em>vinaya</em>) were not prescribed as a result of grave
offences, but rather due to actions being improper in consideration of
future generations.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn80-1"><a href="#fn-fn80">80</a></sup></p>
<p>To sum up, the conduct of arahants, both in regard to duties and to
personal activities, aims for the welfare of the many and is done in
consideration of later generations. They act for the welfare of others
(<em>parattha</em>) and to benefit others (<em>parahita-paṭipatti</em>), consistent
with the virtue of compassion, which acts as the motivation. It is
difficult, however, to clearly picture the life of the arahants by
drawing from stories passed down from the Buddha’s time. These stories
are dispersed throughout the suttas, the rules of discipline, and the
later texts, and they stress essential teachings on Dhammavinaya rather
than the arahants’ personal activities.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s record of foremost disciples (<em>etadagga</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn81-1"><a href="#fn-fn81">81</a></sup> which the
commentators claim is a bestowal of rank,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn82-1"><a href="#fn-fn82">82</a></sup> includes a long list of
arahants’ names, but it merely praises individual abilities or
distinctions of particular disciples. The list mentions work only when
the performance of this work was outstanding, for example Ven.
Dabba-Mallaputta was foremost as the assigner of lodgings
(<em>senāsana-paññapaka</em>). There is no mention, for example, of those
foremost as distributors of meal invitations (<em>bhattuddesaka</em>),
distributors of robes <em>(cīvara-bhājaka</em>), or building managers
(<em>nava-kammika</em>), who are similarly officials appointed by the monastic
community. The arahants mentioned in this list may have had other
regular duties. Moreover, there is a difficulty in that the meanings of
some words describing distinction are obscure. {368} Therefore, this
list of names (<em>etadagga</em>) is inadequate for portraying the extent of
arahants’ activities.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn83-1"><a href="#fn-fn83">83</a></sup></p>
<p>Nonetheless, we can see in this list of foremost disciples that many of
the outstanding qualities are matters related to teaching. One can say
that teaching and training others are duties for all arahants, to be
done according to their ability. Other activities vary, based on
individual skill or disposition. Those arahants proficient in teaching,
as preceptors and teachers (<em>ācariya</em>), were honoured and had many
disciples. Besides their general teaching duties, they were also
responsible for training these disciples; the suttas thus tell of many
great monks who, on their travels, were accompanied by large numbers of
bhikkhus.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn84-1"><a href="#fn-fn84">84</a></sup></p>
<p>Teaching disciples includes educating novices (<em>sāmaṇera</em>). Ven.
Sāriputta, for example, was adept at teaching children and probably had
many novices under his care. When Ven. Rāhula was preparing to be
ordained as a novice, the Buddha entrusted him to Sāriputta as his
preceptor.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn85-1"><a href="#fn-fn85">85</a></sup> There are many famous young accomplished novices who
were Sāriputta’s pupils.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn86-1"><a href="#fn-fn86">86</a></sup> On one occasion Sāriputta, while walking
for alms, met an impoverished orphan, who was wandering in search of
food scraps, and out of compassion encouraged him to ordain as a novice
and study the Dhammavinaya.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn87-1"><a href="#fn-fn87">87</a></sup> The Buddha reminded the monks to look
after the children who came to be ordained.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn88-1"><a href="#fn-fn88">88</a></sup> {369}</p>
<p>With the influx of large numbers of people seeking training came the
duty of supervision. The Buddha advocated a sense of responsibility
around this supervision of the community.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn89-1"><a href="#fn-fn89">89</a></sup> The objective of
community administration is to facilitate training, and to provide
education to as many disciples or students as possible in an atmosphere
of mutual support.</p>
<p>Apart from the responsibilities of teaching, training, and supervising,
the Pali Canon shows that arahants honoured community activities.
Buddhists hold the community (<em>saṅgha</em>) as the authority. The Buddha
continually emphasized communal harmony, both in his Dhamma teachings
(e.g. the ’conditions of prosperity’ – <em>aparihāniya-dhamma</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn90-1"><a href="#fn-fn90">90</a></sup> and
the emphasis of holding the Dhamma as one’s teacher<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn91-1"><a href="#fn-fn91">91</a></sup>), and in the
rules of discipline, especially those concerning formal acts of the
monastic community (<em>saṅgha-kamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn92-1"><a href="#fn-fn92">92</a></sup></p>
<p>Many stories demonstrate concern for communal activities and respect for
the community. For example, when the Buddha encouraged the monks to
perform the observance day (<em>uposatha</em>) each fortnight, by reciting the
Pāṭimokkha and confirming their purity, Ven. Mahākappina wondered
whether he should participate in the ceremony, since he was an arahant
and completely pure. The Buddha knew what he was thinking and admonished
him:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>If you, a brahmin (an arahant), do not honour the observance day, who
will honour it? You should go and perform the observance day ceremony.</p>
<p><em>Vin. I. 105.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Ven. Dabba-Mallaputta accomplished the fruit of arahantship while still
young. He thought:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>I realized arahantship at seven years of age. Whatever a disciple
should attain, I have attained completely. There is nothing that must
be done beyond this, nor is that which had to be done and is finished
need to be added to. What service can I perform for the sangha?</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Later, he thought:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>I should assign dwellings and distribute food for the sangha.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>He then went to inform the Buddha of his willingness. The Buddha
consented and had the bhikkhus meet to consider and accept his
appointment as the assigner of lodgings and distributor of food.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn93-1"><a href="#fn-fn93">93</a></sup></p>
<p>When events take place that may disturb the monastic order, arahants
earnestly exert themselves to resolve the issue, even though they
usually prefer to abide in quiet and solitude. {370} Ven. Mahā Kassapa,
for example, began the proceedings of the First Recitation,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn94-1"><a href="#fn-fn94">94</a></sup> and
Venerables Yasa Kākaṇḍaputta, Sambhūta Sāṇavāsī and Revata initiated the
Second Recitation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn95-1"><a href="#fn-fn95">95</a></sup></p>
<p>In the First Recitation, after the formal act of the sangha
(<em>saṅgha-kamma</em>) was complete and the meeting was officially ended, some
elders present at the meeting formally admonished Ven. Ānanda concerning
offences or mistakes during his attendance on the Buddha. Although
Ānanda had plenty of evidence showing that he did not fail in his duty,
after clearly explaining his conduct he nonetheless acknowledged the
criticism by these elders.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn96-1"><a href="#fn-fn96">96</a></sup></p>
<p>When the bhikkhu sangha met to settle legal matters during the Second
Recitation, two arahants failed to come to the meeting on time. The
gathered elders imposed a penalty, presenting them with tasks to be
performed.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn97-1"><a href="#fn-fn97">97</a></sup> At the time of King Milinda, a king of Greek ancestry
who ruled in Northwest India and was erudite in religious doctrines and
philosophy, the king challenged various religious sects to debate,
causing a disturbance in Buddhist circles. The elder arahants met to
consider a response to the situation. One arahant, named Rohaṇa, had
entered the ’attainment of cessation’ (<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>) in the
Himalayas and being unaware of the meeting did not attend. The gathering
sent a messenger to invite him and also required expiation, presenting
him with the responsibility of ordaining the boy Nāgasena.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn98-1"><a href="#fn-fn98">98</a></sup></p>
<p>Later texts contain similar stories. For example, when the bhikkhu
sangha was helping King Asoka to preserve the teachings, an arahant
named Upagutta had gone into seclusion enjoying the happiness of jhāna,
unaware of the community’s activities. The sangha assembly sent a
bhikkhu to fetch him and then imposed a penalty for seeking his own
individual comfort and not staying in connection with the community.
They gave him the duty of overseeing the celebration of Asoka’s stupa,
which he performed out of respect for the community.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn99-1"><a href="#fn-fn99">99</a></sup> Whatever the
authenticity of these stories, especially the later ones, they
demonstrate clearly the Buddhist tradition of arahants being role models
in honouring the community and being responsible for communal
activities. The cause or motivation for these actions is the same as
that mentioned earlier:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>So that the leading of a sublime life (brahmacariya, i.e. the Buddha’s
teaching) may endure and be established for a long time, and for the
wellbeing and happiness of gods and human beings.{371}</p>
<p><em>Cf.: D. III. 210-11.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3 id="mental-self-mastery-bhāvita-citta"><a class="header" href="#mental-self-mastery-bhāvita-citta">Mental Self-Mastery (bhāvita-citta)</a></h3>
<p>The principal characteristic of an enlightened person’s mind is freedom,
which is the result of wisdom. When a person sees things according to
the truth, fully comprehending conditioned phenomena, the mind is
released from the control of the defilements. The scriptures usually
describe the perfection of freedom as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The mind, which has been fully cultivated by wisdom, is released from
the taints (<em>āsava</em>).</p>
<p><em>D. II. 81, 91, 123.</em></p>
<p>When one knows and sees in this way, the mind is released from the
taint of sense desire, the taint of becoming, and the taint of
ignorance.</p>
<p><em>E.g.: Vin. III. 5; D. I. 84; M. I. 23, 183-4; A. I. 165; A. IV.
174-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>One aspect of freedom from defilement is the end of enslavement to
alluring and provocative sense objects. The Buddha said that sense
objects are the basis for greed, hatred and delusion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn100-1"><a href="#fn-fn100">100</a></sup> Also, the
absence of an impulse to act unjustly or harmfully guarantees moral
rectitude.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn101-1"><a href="#fn-fn101">101</a></sup> Another aspect of freedom is the absence of fear,
trepidation and terror.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn102-1"><a href="#fn-fn102">102</a></sup></p>
<p>An arahant has mastery over sense objects and is thus described as ’one
who has trained the sense bases’ (i.e. he or she has completed the
development of the sense faculties – <em>indriya-bhāvanā</em>). This means
that when cognizing a sense object, for example a sight or a sound, and
a natural recognition of agreeableness, disagreeableness or neutrality
arises, arahants can control perception (<em>saññā</em>) as they wish. For
example, they can perceive the repulsive as unrepulsive, or perceive the
unrepulsive as repulsive, as well as abandon both the repulsive and the
unrepulsive, dwelling equanimous and mindful.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn103-1"><a href="#fn-fn103">103</a></sup></p>
<p>Possessing mindfulness and self-mastery, an arahant is called ’one who
has been trained’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn104-1"><a href="#fn-fn104">104</a></sup> and a ’self-conqueror, the greatest of those
victorious in battle’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn105-1"><a href="#fn-fn105">105</a></sup> An arahant’s mind is stable, and does not
tremble as a consequence of agreeable or disagreeable sense objects. It
is like a mountain, which is not shaken by the wind,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn106-1"><a href="#fn-fn106">106</a></sup> or like the
earth, which bears all things and is neither angered nor offended when
filthy items are cast upon it.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn107-1"><a href="#fn-fn107">107</a></sup></p>
<p>An additional aspect of freedom is non-clinging, which the Buddha often
compared to a lotus leaf, which is not adhered to by water, or a lotus
blossom, which grows in the mud but is pure, clean and beautiful.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn108-1"><a href="#fn-fn108">108</a></sup>
A person begins by not clinging to sensuality, to merit, and to good and
evil, as clinging to these things is the cause for brooding over the
past and yearning for the future: {372}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>[A bhikkhu who has realized the Dhamma] does not grieve over the
past, and does not fantasize over the future; he is sustained by what
is present, thus his complexion is bright. As for the ignorant, they
fantasize over the future, and pine over the past; thus they are
haggard, like a fresh reed that has been plucked and left in the sun.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the Bhaddekaratta Sutta there is a similar passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>One should not pursue the past, nor yearn for the future; the past has
gone away, the future has not yet been reached.</p>
<p><em>M. III. 187.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Not brooding over the past and not yearning for the future are
classified here as aspects of the <em>citta</em>, not of wisdom. They
correspond to the domain of ’emotion’. There are terms describing the
attributes of an arahant in respect to the past and future that are
matters of wisdom, for example: reminiscence of past lives
(<em>pubbenivāsānussati-ñāṇa</em>), knowledge of the decease and rebirth of
beings (<em>cutūpapāta-ñāṇa</em>), knowledge of the past (<em>atītaṁsa-ñāṇa</em>), and
knowledge of the future (<em>anāgataṁsa-ñāṇa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn109-1"><a href="#fn-fn109">109</a></sup> Arahants draw upon
knowledge of the past and use wisdom to consider future activities.
Indeed, because an arahant’s heart is free from the past and future,
knowledge concerning the past and future can be used by wisdom in the
most beneficial way. In addition, an arahant’s actions are generally
performed to assist future generations, as was explained earlier.</p>
<p>Some of the aspects of an arahant’s mind will be at odds with the views
of ordinary people, since superficially these aspects are considered
unpleasant or blameworthy. One such aspect that the Buddha mentioned
often is <em>nirāsa</em> (or <em>nirāsā</em>), which can be translated as ’hopeless’,
’wishless’, or ’without expectation’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn110-1"><a href="#fn-fn110">110</a></sup> This hopelessness, or
absence of wishing, of an enlightened person has a more profound
meaning, however, than that which most people usually consider. Ordinary
human beings normally live with hope. This hope is based on desire,
wanting various things or wanting to be a particular way, thus hoping to
obtain or to become. This hope sustains life; when someone is
disappointed or feels hopeless due to not getting what is wished for, or
due to the unattainability of an object, then that person is considered
to have misfortune. When someone is gratified by obtaining what is
wanted or something desirable appears to be within reach, that person is
considered to be fortunate.</p>
<p>A hopeful person, however, still has a concealed expectation or
anticipation that is constantly present, even if he is not conscious of
it, that is, the possibility of being disappointed or falling into
despair. This aspect of hope is often referred to as ’apprehension’,
which is a form of fear – a form of suffering. Hope thus comes paired
with apprehension; if hope remains, fear remains. {373}</p>
<p>An arahant resembles the person who has lost hope, but there is an
important distinction. An arahant’s ’hopelessness’ or absence of
expectation is not a consequence of there being no way to obtain what is
desired; instead, it results from an inner completeness and satiety.
There is nothing lacking which must be wished for; there is no
deficiency giving rise to desire and hope. In short, an arahant’s
freedom from hope stems from an absence of craving. When one does not
yearn for things, and does not long to be some particular way, then
there is nothing to be hoped for. When there is nothing to be hoped for
then one lives without hope; one has given up or ended hope, along with
the fear that springs from hope.</p>
<p>This implies that people can exist without depending on or entrusting
their life and happiness to hope. Arahants have gone beyond both
gratification and hopelessness as these terms are ordinarily defined.
Being fulfilled and content, they surpass those who are gratified or
hopeful. This is a level that is superior to or free from hope, because
there is complete happiness in each present moment. There is no
opportunity for further disappointment or despair (compare this with
<em>assaddha</em> – ’faithlessness’ – as a wisdom quality).</p>
<p>Many other heart qualities exist, which are related to those mentioned
above, for example:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn111-1"><a href="#fn-fn111">111</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Akiñcana</em>: no anxiety; nothing lingering in the mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Asoka</em>: happy; sorrowless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Khema</em>: secure; safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nicchāta</em>: ’hungerless’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Santa</em>: no confusion, restlessness, worry, irritation, depression,
boredom, or fear; peaceful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Santuṭṭha</em>: satisfied; contented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sītibhūta</em>; <em>nibbuta</em>: tranquil; cooled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Viraja</em>: free from mental impurity; immaculate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Visaṭṭho gacchati …</em>: ’Totally at ease while walking, standing,
sitting and lying down.’</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha emphasized happiness (<em>sukha</em>). There are terms describing
the state of Nibbāna as happiness, terms describing those who have
realized Nibbāna as happy, and statements by such realized ones
themselves describing their own happiness. For example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Nibbāna is the supreme happiness; <em>M. I. 509; Dh. verses 202-204.</em></p>
<p>Nibbāna is indeed great happiness; <em>Ud. 15; Thag. verses 227, 263.</em></p>
<p>There is no greater happiness<br />
than the happiness of Nibbāna; <em>Thīg. verse 476.</em></p>
<p>This is unsurpassed happiness; <em>A. III. 354.</em></p>
<p>Truly, the arahants are happy; <em>S. III. 83.</em></p>
<p>One perfectly awakened always sleeps happily; <em>A. I. 138.</em></p>
<p>One who is without anxiety is indeed happy; <em>Ud. 14.</em></p>
<p>I, without anxiety, am indeed truly happy; <em>Dh. verses 200-204.</em></p>
<p>Oh, what bliss! <em>Vin. II. 183; Thīg. verse 24.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Even for those who are training in the Dhamma it is necessary to view
Nibbāna as happiness for the practice to be correct, as stated in the
Buddha’s words:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, that someone who views Nibbāna as suffering will possess
investigation conducive to the realization of truth (anulomikā khanti)
is impossible. That someone who does not possess investigation
conducive to the realization of truth will proceed to the righteous
way (sammatta-niyāma) is impossible. {374} That someone who has not
proceeded to the righteous way will realize the fruits of
stream-entry, once-returner, non-returner, or arahantship is
impossible.</p>
<p>Monks, that someone who views Nibbāna as happiness will possess
investigation conducive to the realization of truth is possible. That
someone who possesses investigation conducive to the realization of
truth will proceed to the righteous way is possible. That someone, who
proceeds to the righteous way should realize the fruits of
stream-entry, once-returner, non-returner, or arahantship is
possible.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn112-1"><a href="#fn-fn112">112</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. III. 442-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Although Nibbāna is happiness, and those who have realized Nibbāna are
happy, such realized ones do not cling to happiness of any kind, and do
not become attached to or indulge in Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn113-1"><a href="#fn-fn113">113</a></sup> When cognizing
external sense objects, for example by way of the eye or ear, an arahant
still experiences feelings – pleasant, unpleasant and neutral –
connected with those objects, just like an ordinary person. An exception
exists, however, in that an arahant experiences feelings without being
constricted by defilement. An arahant neither rejoices over nor is
troubled by feelings; nor are those feelings a cause for craving.
Feeling exists at only one level, which is called ’experiencing feeling
by way of the body but not the mind’. Feeling does not give rise to
internal affliction or worry; such feeling is said to be ’cooled’. An
arahant experiences feelings without latent tendencies (<em>anusaya</em>),
unlike unenlightened beings, who have the latent tendency of lust
(<em>rāgānusaya</em>) when experiencing pleasure, the latent tendency of
hostility (<em>paṭighānusaya</em>) when experiencing pain, and the latent
tendency of ignorance (<em>avijjānusaya</em>) when experiencing neutral
feelings, perpetually increasing the habit and strength of these
defilements.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn114-1"><a href="#fn-fn114">114</a></sup></p>
<p>Pleasure and pain from external sources are unable to affect an
arahant’s internal happiness. An arahant’s happiness is thus
independent, not relying on external phenomena. It is an immaterial
happiness (<em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>), or even surpasses immaterial happiness
(ordinary <em>nirāmisa-sukha</em> is the happiness of jhāna.)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn115-1"><a href="#fn-fn115">115</a></sup> As an
arahant’s happiness is independent of external conditions, the natural
fluctuation of things is not a cause for suffering. Even if the six
sense objects change and pass away, an arahant still abides in
happiness;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn116-1"><a href="#fn-fn116">116</a></sup> even if the five aggregates change and become
otherwise, there is no sorrow or suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn117-1"><a href="#fn-fn117">117</a></sup> A thorough knowledge
of impermanence brings about tranquillity and contentment. The Buddha
described this happiness as one attribute of being a refuge onto
oneself, or of having the Dhamma as a refuge.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn118-1"><a href="#fn-fn118">118</a></sup> {375}</p>
<p>Another important descriptive term for an arahant’s mind, which covers
many of the characteristics already mentioned, is <em>ārogya</em>, translated
as ’without sickness’ or ’freedom from illness’. It can also be rendered
as ’health’ or ’healthy’. <em>Ārogya</em> is an epithet for Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn119-1"><a href="#fn-fn119">119</a></sup>
Being without illness or being healthy refers here to the absence of
mental illness or to a healthy mind, as mentioned in the Buddha’s
teachings to an aged layman:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>You should practise and train yourself thus: although the body is
diseased, the mind will not be diseased.</p>
<p><em>S. III. 1.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha said that there are two kinds of illness: physical and
mental:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Beings who can assert to be without illness of the mind are difficult
to find in the world, with the exception of one who is free from the
taints.</p>
<p><em>A. II. 143-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These words of the Buddha illustrate that an arahant is a person with
perfect mental health.</p>
<p>The description of an arahant as being free of illness or in good health
reveals the value of realizing Nibbāna. One may wonder: if arahants do
not seek the pleasures cherished by ordinary people, how can they be
happy, and what worth does Nibbāna have?</p>
<p>An absence of illness is a condition of happiness that is complete in
itself. It is far better than the happiness resulting from a temporary
alleviation of pain, not to mention the discomfort of sickness and
chronic ailments.</p>
<p>Obtaining medicine or treatment to allay symptoms of illness offers
momentary happiness. The more severe the symptoms, the greater the
happiness when the symptoms subside. From one perspective, a healthy
person is denied this kind of pleasure. But no one in their right mind
would desire a sick person’s happiness, of waiting to savour the end of
pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>In the case of an illness, happiness is experienced through the repeated
or occasional alleviation of discomfort and agitation. Such occasional
happiness can be compared to the pleasure sought by ordinary people. The
happiness of being without illness, which is normally not recognized as
happiness, is simply internal ease and relief. This can be compared to
the state of an arahant or to the happiness of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The Buddha applied the analogy of a leper with erupting sores. Due to
irritation and itching, the leper scratches the lesions and heats his
flesh over coals. The more he scratches and sears his body, the more
itchy and inflamed do the sores become. The happiness and pleasant
sensation he receives relies upon having a wound that can be scratched.
{376} The leper will remain in this state until a skilled doctor
prepares a medicine that cures him of the leprosy. Cured of leprosy, he
becomes a person in good health (<em>aroga</em>), happy (<em>sukhī</em>), free
(<em>serī</em>), with self-mastery (<em>sayaṁvasī</em>), and able to go where he
pleases (<em>yena-kāmaṅgama</em>). Both the scratching of the sores and the
heating by the fire, which used to provide him with pleasure and relief,
are no longer considered by him as a form of happiness. He now regards
such behaviour as painful and miserable.</p>
<p>This analogy can be applied to ordinary beings, who seek pleasure from
the five ’strands’ of sensuality. Although they experience pleasure
through obtaining things and gratifying desire, they are inflamed by
desire, experiencing increasing turmoil and agitation. When life is
conducted in this manner, pleasure and delight only revolve around the
arousal of craving, leading to increased passion. Gratification is
sought to temporarily quell the agitation. With the realization of
Nibbāna, no ’fuel’ remains to provoke craving, and happiness is
experienced without alleviating an inflammation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn120-1"><a href="#fn-fn120">120</a></sup></p>
<p>An unenlightened person is compared to someone who derives pleasure from
scratching an itch. The greater the itch the more one scratches, and the
more one scratches the greater the itch. And the greater the itch the
greater the pleasure from scratching. An ordinary person thus likes to
increase the degree of pleasure by seeking ways to increase the
stimulation and excitement, and so increase the itch; as a result more
pleasure is experienced from increased scratching. A realized being is
like someone who is cured from an itch-inducing illness, whose normal
physical state is healthy; happiness exists due to the absence of an
itch and of a need to scratch. An ordinary person, however, may
criticize such a person as lacking the pleasure derived from scratching
an itch.</p>
<p>Similarly, an unenlightened person’s search for happiness is like
building up and fanning a fire, and then receiving amusement and
coolness by extinguishing it. The brighter and hotter the fire, the more
effort needed for extinguishing, causing more spectacular crackling and
flashing. Ordinary people conduct their lives in this way, despite
greater risks of danger for themselves and others. Those who are
liberated resemble persons who have extinguished the fire. They live in
ease, coolness, and safety, with no need to be burnt, and with no need
to be on guard against dangers from heat. They are not engaged in the
thrill or anxiety of extinguishing a fire that they previously ignited.</p>
<p>Realization brings about changes in personality, as well as in attitudes
towards the world. Such mental transformation can be compared to the
development of a child into an adult. Adults no longer hold dear those
toys and games that were cherished during childhood. An adult may even
be amused seeing a child fascinated with and possessive of such toys.
Likewise, a person who has realized Nibbāna has reached a stage of
development that surpasses ordinary beings. Attitudes towards life,
towards things admired by ordinary people, and towards the way people
conduct their lives, have changed.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn121-1"><a href="#fn-fn121">121</a></sup> {377}</p>
<h3 id="wisdom-self-mastery-bhāvita-paññā"><a class="header" href="#wisdom-self-mastery-bhāvita-paññā">Wisdom Self-Mastery (bhāvita-paññā)</a></h3>
<p>The basis for an arahant’s wisdom is the ability to see things as they
truly are. This clear seeing starts at cognition of sense objects by way
of the six senses, with a mind that is equanimous and mindful, not
swayed by pleasure or aversion. Such a person is able to observe a sense
impression from beginning to end without being distracted or disturbed
by it. Ordinary people, on the other hand, tend to get stuck at the
point where sense impressions produce a feeling of pleasure and
aversion. As a result, they tend to elaborate on and create distorted
ideas about the things they encounter. They have a false understanding:
they see things clouded by defilement rather than as they truly are.
Take for example a person who agrees with a statement when he has been
flattered but disagrees without the flattery. Or a person may agree
because he likes the speaker yet disagree when the identical subject is
mentioned by someone he dislikes.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn122-1"><a href="#fn-fn122">122</a></sup></p>
<p>Arahants are not deceived by the external appearances of things; they
acknowledge all facets of the truth and do not attach to just one
perspective. The wisdom of an arahant helps to dispel the claim that
Buddhism is a pessimistic doctrine. For example, those who have realized
the truth (<em>buddhadhamma</em>) know that the five aggregates are neither
exclusively painful nor exclusively pleasant.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn123-1"><a href="#fn-fn123">123</a></sup> A person who is to
be enlightened must understand the merits (<em>assāda</em>) and disadvantages
(<em>ādīnava</em>) of sense desire, as well as the deliverance (<em>nissaraṇa</em>)
from it. The merits are seen as merits, the disadvantages as
disadvantages, and the deliverance as deliverance. The abandonment of
sense desire and the end of both hankering for the world and grasping
the five aggregates is due to seeing the way of deliverance. A person
will then be independent of such merits and disadvantages, abiding in
happiness – a happiness that is subtler and greater than happiness
conditioned by pleasant and unpleasant experiences.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn124-1"><a href="#fn-fn124">124</a></sup></p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The exquisite things in the world are not referred to as sense desire
(kāma); [only] a person’s lustful intentions constitute sense
desire…. The exquisite things in the world abide just as they are;
therefore, the wise [only] remove the fascination for these things.</p>
<p><em>A. III. 411.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Another level of wisdom is the comprehension of the universal
characteristics (impermanence – <em>anicca</em>, <em>dukkha</em>, and ’nonself’ –
<em>anattā</em>), and of language, in particular of ’conventions’ (<em>sammati</em>)
and ’designations’ (<em>paññatti</em>). {378} The comprehension of language
includes understanding the nature of ’worldly speech’ (<em>lokiya-vohāra</em>)
and knowing how to use language to convey meaning without clinging to
linguistic conventions:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A monk whose mind is liberated sides with no one and disputes with no
one; he employs the speech currently used in the world without
attaching to it.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 500.</em></p>
<p>An arahant with taints destroyed may say, ’I speak this way, and they
speak to me this way.’ Skilful, knowing the world’s parlance, he uses
such terms as mere expressions.</p>
<p><em>S. I. 14.</em></p>
<p>Monks, I do not contend with the world; rather, it is the world that
contends with me. A speaker of the Dhamma (<em>dhamma-vādī</em>) does not
dispute with anyone in the world. Whatever the learned ones agree upon
as not existing in the world, I too say that it does not exist.
Whatever the learned ones agree upon as existing, I too say that it
exists.</p>
<p><em>S. III. 138.</em></p>
<p>These are worldly terms, expressions, manners of speech and
designations. The Tathāgata uses these, but does not attach to them.</p>
<p><em>D. I. 202.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>With the arising of wisdom, seeing how all conditioned things originate
from interdependent causes, a person understands the world according to
truth. This is the arising of a correct worldview. Metaphysical beliefs
and theories, as well as doubts (<em>avyākata-pañhā</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn125-1"><a href="#fn-fn125">125</a></sup> vanish
automatically:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance,
whichever conflicting, obstinate, and confounding views exist, such
as: ’What are mental formations? Who owns these mental formations?
Mental formations are one thing, the owners of such formations are
another thing; the life principle (jīva) and the body are the same;
the life principle is one thing, the body is another’ – all of these
views are abandoned.</p>
<p><em>S. II. 64.</em></p>
<p>A bhikkhu inquired: What is the cause, what is the condition, by which
a learned noble disciple will not have doubt arise concerning the
matters that the Lord has not explained?</p>
<p>The Buddha replied: With the cessation of ignorance, learned noble
disciples will not have doubt arise concerning the matters that I have
not explained…. An unlearned, unenlightened person does not clearly
know views, the origin of views, the cessation of views, and the way
leading to the cessation of views. Those views increase, and he will
not be released from aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief
and despair.</p>
<p><em>A. IV. 67-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Another feature of an arahant’s wisdom is that he or she does not rely
on faith or belief, a quality which in Pali is called <em>assaddha</em>
(’faithless’). {379} This quality is the opposite of disbelief or
faithlessness in the ordinary sense, which means not believing due to
lack of confidence in others or due to obstinacy. Here it means one does
not need to believe because one knows and sees with clarity. One knows
for oneself and is independent of the knowledge of others. Faith implies
reliance on someone else’s knowledge when we do not yet clearly know for
ourselves. Once we have seen something as it truly is, there is no need
to depend on others for knowledge. This is a knowledge that is greater
than faith or belief:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Of things that are fully known by himself, evident to himself, he does
not have faith in others – neither ascetics, nor brahmins, nor gods,
nor Māra, nor Brahma; he does not believe others concerning things
fully known by himself, evident to himself, that is: ’Formations are
impermanent; formations are dukkha; formations are nonself; with
ignorance as condition, there are mental formations….’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn126-1"><a href="#fn-fn126">126</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Nd. I. 235.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Likewise, Ven. Sāriputta said to the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>In this matter I do not go with faith to the Blessed One … this
matter I have known, seen, experienced, realized and discerned with
wisdom – therefore, I have no doubts or uncertainties.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 221.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>At the time of the Buddha, people were very interested in the concept of
a ’great man’ (<em>mahāpurisa</em>), and therefore there are many passages in
the Tipiṭaka in reference to this term. There are references to the
’characteristics of a great man’ (<em>mahāpurisa-lakkhaṇa</em>), for example in
the case of the brahmins’ predictions about Prince Siddhattha, which
were based on their ancient texts. But from the perspective of the
teachings, more interesting passages pertain to the question posed to
the Buddha after his awakening of who is worthy of the title ’great
man’. This frequent question shows that this concept was still important
and a matter of debate.</p>
<p>On one occasion Ven. Sāriputta went to see the Buddha and asked him this
question:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Venerable sir, it is said, ’a great man, a great man.’ In what way is
one a great man?</p>
<p>[The Buddha replied:]</p>
<p>With a liberated mind, I say, Sāriputta, one is a great man. Without a
liberated mind, I say, one is not a great man.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 158.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This reply indicates that the Buddha considered an arahant – one who
has completed the four aspects of development – to be a great man. His
reply is very brief and succinct, focusing on the final criteria: a
completion of the four kinds of development, culminating in liberating
wisdom. No matter how skilled or proficient a person may be, if he is
still not fully liberated from mental defilement, he is not yet a great
man.</p>
<p>To be worthy of this title, one must be free from suffering. For
example, one’s thought processes are truly free from any restriction or
impurity, which does not mean that one obtains everything that one
wishes for or faces no obstruction or coercion from others. On the
highest level, one’s wisdom is free from any domination or manipulation
from a fabricated sense of ’self’. {380} One’s thoughts do not simply
follow one’s desires, propelled by craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), conceit (<em>māna</em>),
and fixed views (<em>diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
<p>In any case, the reason for the Buddha’s brevity here is most likely
because he was speaking to Ven. Sāriputta, the foremost disciple
proficient in wisdom. The Buddha thus mentioned only the decisive
criteria, along with tying in the concept of liberation with the
teaching on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, presenting the supreme
perspective on this subject.</p>
<p>A teaching by the Buddha which elaborates on this concept of a great man
stems from a conversation he had with Vassakāra, the chief minister of
Magadha. On one occasion while the Buddha was staying in the Bamboo
Grove at Rājagaha, he was approached by Vassakāra, who said that
according to his own doctrine a person considered to be a great man with
superior wisdom is endowed with four attributes: (1) he is highly
learned, well-informed of various fields of learning, and understands
the meaning of various statements, able to distinguish one from another;
(2) he has a good memory; he remembers and recollects what was done and
said long ago; (3) he is skilful and diligent in attending to the
diverse chores of a householder; and (4) he possesses sound judgement,
knowing how to carry out and arrange his affairs.</p>
<p>After presenting this explanation Vassakāra asked the Buddha whether he
approves or rejects this statement. The Buddha replied, saying that he
neither approves nor rejects the statement, but that he himself
describes a great man with superior wisdom as possessing four other
qualities:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A person practises for the welfare and happiness of the manyfolk;
he is one who has established people in the noble way, that is, to
be endowed with beautiful and wholesome qualities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He thinks whatever he wants to think and does not think what he
does not want to think; he intends whatever he wants to intend and
does not intend what he does not want to intend; thus he has
attained to mental mastery over the ways of thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He gains at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas
that constitute the higher mind (<em>abhicitta</em>) and are pleasant
abidings in this very life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the destruction of the taints, he has realized for himself
with direct knowledge the taintless liberation of mind and
liberation by wisdom, and dwells in it here and now.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>A. II. 35.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Although there are many teachings by the Buddha on this concept of a
great man, they usually appear in verse form and are a reply to people’s
specific questions, so most are either brief or focused on one
particular aspect. The teaching presented to the chief minister above is
in prose, and it contains clearly defined principles, which are relevant
to everyone. The four aspects of self-mastery (<em>bhāvita</em>) are
incorporated in the four attributes of a great man. Expressed in a
different way, these four attributes reveal another aspect of the four
kinds of development, highlighting the superior and exceptional
capabilities of an arahant which are difficult for an ordinary person to
attain.</p>
<p>The first attribute reveals how arahants – those who have fulfilled the
holy life (<em>brahmacariya</em>) – are no longer burdened with any personal
concerns, including any form of spiritual training. From the time of
their full awakening, they devote themselves entirely to the welfare and
happiness of the multitudes, which becomes the essence of their lives.
{381} This corresponds to the goal of the holy life – to Buddhism in
its entirety – which is encapsulated in the Buddha’s frequent
exhortation: to act ’for the benefit of the manyfolk, for the happiness
of the manyfolk, out of compassion for people in the world.’</p>
<p>This compassionate, altruistic action also points to the connection
between individual happiness and promoting the happiness of others.</p>
<p>In whichever way one describes the attributes of arahants, including the
preceding description of the fourfold self-mastery, they always rest
firmly on three essential qualities: wisdom (specifically called
<em>vijjā</em>); liberation (<em>vimutti</em>); and compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>), which is
the force radiating knowledge and wisdom outwards, resulting in others
obtaining knowledge and arriving at deliverance.</p>
<p>If we identify an unawakened being as someone bound, wisdom is the knife
that cuts the bonds, liberation is the release from the bonds into
freedom, and compassion is, once a person is no longer agitated and
anxious about his or her own concerns, the looking to others who are
still bound and extricating them.</p>
<p>Technically, <em>vijjā</em> is the path (<em>magga</em>), whereas <em>vimutti</em> is
generally considered fruit or result (<em>phala</em>). The authors of later
texts, however, have divided <em>vimutti</em> into more detail as two parts, as
both path and fruit. They say that the act or moment of release is the
path; the state of having been released and abiding in freedom is the
fruit.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn127-1"><a href="#fn-fn127">127</a></sup> The realization of Nibbāna is completed at wisdom and
liberation; compassion is the subsequent acting for others. In other
words, personal concerns (<em>attattha</em>) are ended at wisdom and
liberation; matters to be done for others (<em>parattha</em>) are deeds then
taken up by compassion.</p>
<p>Note that of these three qualities – wisdom, liberation and compassion
– liberation is a result; it is a finished condition and facilitates
further action but is not the agent itself. Wisdom and compassion are
agents. Wisdom is the factor bringing about the realization of Nibbāna,
which is the accomplishment of personal concerns. Compassion is the
factor that helps to settle the affairs of others. For this reason
wisdom and compassion are professed to be primary attributes of the
Buddha. Wisdom is the essential element for personal welfare
(<em>attattha</em>) or for the completion of personal benefit
(<em>attahita-sampatti</em>), while compassion is the essential element for
others’ wellbeing (<em>parattha</em>) or for the practice of benefiting others
(<em>parahita-paṭipatti</em>).</p>
<p>In short, the Buddha’s attributes are of two kinds: the completion of
personal benefit, with wisdom as agent, and the practice of benefiting
others, with compassion as agent.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn128-1"><a href="#fn-fn128">128</a></sup> Both the completion of personal
benefit and the practice of benefiting others are meaningful and genuine
because they are confirmed by liberation. {382} Liberation is proof of
the arrival at Nibbāna; it is an essential characteristic of Nibbāna and
is synonymous with Nibbāna.</p>

<p>{396} In the Dhammacetiya Sutta, King Pasenadi of Kosala told the Buddha
the reasons for his faith in the Triple Gem. The Buddha endorsed these
principles as <em>dhamma-cetiya</em> (’monuments’ in honour of the Dhamma) and
said they are fundamental to the holy life. He encouraged the members of
the monastic sangha to remember them. One section of this sutta
describes the bhikkhu disciples of the Buddha as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Again, venerable sir, I have walked and wandered from park to park and
from garden to garden. There I have seen some recluses and brahmins
who are lean, wretched, unsightly, jaundiced, with veins standing out
on their limbs, such that people would not want to look at them
again.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn129-1"><a href="#fn-fn129">129</a></sup> I have thought: ’Surely these venerable ones are leading
the holy life in discontent, or they have done some evil deed and are
concealing it…. But here I see bhikkhus smiling and cheerful,
sincerely joyful, plainly delighting, their faculties fresh, living at
ease, unruffled, subsisting on what others give,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn130-1"><a href="#fn-fn130">130</a></sup> abiding with a
mind as a wild deer’s.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn131-1"><a href="#fn-fn131">131</a></sup> I have thought: ’Surely these venerable
ones perceive successive states of lofty distinction in the Blessed
One’s Dispensation…. This too, venerable sir, is why I infer
according to Dhamma about the Blessed One: ’The Blessed One is fully
enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the
sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the good
way.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn132-1"><a href="#fn-fn132">132</a></sup></p>

<p>At one time Ven. Upasena Thera was sitting in a cave in the Sītavana
forest. Two venomous snakes were chasing each other when one of them
fell on Upasena and bit him. The poison spread quickly. He knew that he

<p>The elder Ven. Adhimutta was captured by bandits but experienced no
fear. The bandit leader was perplexed:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’Those people in the past whom we have killed for a sacrifice or to
obtain their money were always afraid; they trembled and wailed. But
you experience no fear and your complexion is bright. How is it that
you don’t cry out at a time of such grave danger?’</p>
<p>’One who is not attached to life experiences no mental suffering,
chieftain. One who has destroyed the fetters has passed beyond all
fear of pain…. I do not fear death, just like someone would not fear
laying down a burden…. One who has reached the Ultimate needs
nothing in the world. He is not aggrieved by death; he is like one who
has escaped a burning house. The Lord Buddha has said that all things
in this world and all realms attainable by beings are dependent…. I
have no thought of “I have been”, “I will be”, or “I will not be”, or
the thought: “My formations will vanish.” Why should I cry out over
these formations? Chieftain, one who sees according to truth that
there is only the arising of phenomena, only the succession of
formations, experiences no fear. When a person sees the world with
wisdom as similar to wood and grass, then he will have no need to
seize anything as “mine”; he does not grieve: “Mine is lost.”</p>
<p>’I have no more requirement for this body; I wish for no realm of
existence; this body will disintegrate and there will not be another.
Whatever you must do with my body, do as you wish. I will experience
no anger or delight as a consequence of your actions.’</p>
<p>Listening to the elder’s words, the bandits’ hair stood on end and
they dropped their weapons. After further questioning, they asked to
become disciples. Some of them even requested ordination as Buddhist
monks. {399}</p>

<p>When encountering these canonical records of the inner life of arahants,
ordinary people may brand arahants as eccentric, wrongly imagining that
they have no concern for others and heartlessly let things take their
own course. Therefore, it is important to remind people of arahants’
outward behaviour, that they conduct their lives responsibly and justly.
What is the nature of a person’s life when there are no unresolved
experiences congesting the mind or defilements ruling the heart?
Eccentric or strange behaviour can be found in some persons who have
attained certain levels of concentrative release (<em>cetovimutti</em>).
Arahants, however, have attained release through wisdom
(<em>paññā-vimutti</em>); they do not hold even to the thought: ’I am one who
is free from grasping.’ No impurities are there to form an identity as
someone who is unattached. No new attachments are made (e.g. to
spiritual attainments) which could bring about a dismissive attitude
towards the thing they left behind. Nor are there any defilements that
cause disgust or disinterest. Arahants thus act reasonably,
appropriately and wisely, out of wholesome service to the world. {400}</p>
<p>An absence of fear (even of being startled) is a key mental attribute of
an arahant.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn137-1"><a href="#fn-fn137">137</a></sup> As mentioned earlier in the section on qualities of
the heart (<em>citta</em>), arahants are free of any greed, hatred or delusion,
which are the causes for fear and anxiety. Fear stems from defilements
buried deeply in the subconscious. It is an immediate reaction when
confronted by frightening objects, a process that happens so quickly a
person is not fully aware of it. Because the reaction occurs before
mindfulness is established, fear is very difficult to conceal. It is
thus a good indication that subtle mental impurities still lie dormant.
When fear is present, it is not easy to deceive others or to delude
oneself.</p>
<p>In special circumstances, when outward behaviour suggests the
realization of arahantship, or someone mistakenly believes to have
reached such realization, Dhamma practitioners have used fear as a test.
An example from the scriptures is the story of an elder monk proficient
at the eight ’attainments’ (<em>samāpatti</em>). As the mental defilements were
suppressed by the power of these attainments, for sixty years he
believed himself to be an arahant. One day when he saw a trumpeting,
ferocious elephant he was startled, and thus knew that he was still
unawakened.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn138-1"><a href="#fn-fn138">138</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="seven-noble-beings"><a class="header" href="#seven-noble-beings">Seven Noble Beings</a></h2>
<p>This division of noble beings focuses on the spiritual faculties
(<em>indriya</em>) and is also connected to the eight liberations (<em>vimokkha</em>).</p>
<p>The <em>indriya</em> (literally: ’ruling principles’) act as sources of
empowerment in spiritual practice. They control or combat unfavourable
mental qualities like lack of confidence, laziness, negligence,
distraction, and ignorance. There are five such faculties: faith
(<em>saddhā</em>), energy (<em>viriya</em>), mindfulness (<em>sati</em>), concentration
(<em>samādhi</em>) and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). Dhamma practitioners possess varying
degrees of these faculties. Three of these faculties have an effect on
the kind of realization of noble beings (<em>ariya-puggala</em>): faith
(<em>saddhindriya</em>), concentration (<em>samādhindriya</em>) and wisdom
(<em>paññindriya</em>).</p>
<p><em>Vimokkha</em> is the liberation from unfavourable mental qualities,
resulting from the delight of being absorbed in an object of attention.
This liberation, however, is dependent on the power of concentration in
the state of jhāna, and exists only as long as one abides in
jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn139-1"><a href="#fn-fn139">139</a></sup> It is not the complete liberation from defilements and
suffering which is synonymous with Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn140-1"><a href="#fn-fn140">140</a></sup> {412}</p>
<p>There are eight kinds of <em>vimokkha</em>:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn141-1"><a href="#fn-fn141">141</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>’Dwelling in form, one perceives form.’ This refers to the four
fine-material jhānas of someone who practises <em>kasiṇa</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn142-1"><a href="#fn-fn142">142</a></sup>
meditation and uses an attribute of the body, e.g. the colour of
hair, as the meditation object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’Not perceiving internal form, one perceives external form.’ This
refers to the four fine-material jhānas of someone who uses an
external object for <em>kasiṇa</em> meditation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’Absorbed in beauty.’ This refers to the jhāna of someone practising
colour <em>kasiṇa</em> meditation. The Paṭisambhidāmagga also includes the
jhāna of a person cultivating the four divine abidings
(<em>brahmavihāra</em> or <em>appamaññā</em>): loving kindness (<em>mettā</em>),
compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>), appreciative joy (<em>muditā</em>), and equanimity
(<em>upekkhā</em>). Meditation on the four divine abidings leads a person
to see all beings as beautiful, with no feelings of disgust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abiding in the sphere of unbounded space (<em>ākāsānañcāyatana</em>). With
the end of perception of repulsion (<em>paṭigha-saññā</em>) and perception
of diversity (<em>nānatta-saññā</em>), one transcends the perception of
form (<em>rūpa-saññā</em>). One meditates on the boundlessness of space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transcending the sphere of unbounded space, one attains the sphere
of unbounded consciousness (<em>viññāṇañcāyatana</em>). One meditates on
the boundlessness of consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transcending the sphere of unbounded consciousness, one attains the
sphere of nothingness (<em>ākiñcaññāyatana</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transcending the sphere of nothingness, one attains the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-nonperception (<em>nevasaññānāsaññāyatana</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transcending the sphere of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, one
attains the cessation of perception and feeling
(<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>), also known as the ’attainment of
cessation’ (<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These eight liberations comprise all nine ’gradual stages of meditative
attainment’ (<em>anupubbavihāra-samāpatti</em>) as illustrated on
Figure <a href="#fig-gradual-stages">Gradual Stages of Meditative Attainment</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">Gradual Stages of Meditative Attainment</span><a id="fig-gradual-stages"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/gradual-stages.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>The spiritual faculties (<em>indriya</em>) are linked to the liberations in the
following way: when a person begins spiritual practice, he or she will
possess a dominant faculty of either faith or wisdom. {413} If that
person develops concentration to a level higher than the third
liberation (i.e. attains formless jhāna), the faculty of concentration
(<em>samādhindriya</em>) will become the dominant faculty. Those practitioners
whose dominant faculty remains faith or wisdom may attain the four
fine-material jhānas but they will not attain the formless jhānas.
Conventionally speaking, they do not attain ’vimokkha’. Concentration as
a dominant faculty, however, in the end must give way to and act as a
basis for wisdom. Up to that point, concentration will facilitate the
attainment of the higher liberations (<em>vimokkha</em>).</p>
<p>At this point we can examine how the seven noble beings
(<em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em>) are connected to the faculties and liberations.
Ordinarily, the seven noble beings are presented from the highest to the
lowest, but to conform with the presentation of the eight noble beings
presented earlier, they are listed here from the lowest to the
highest:<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn143-1"><a href="#fn-fn143">143</a></sup></p>

<em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em> and <em>ariya-puggala</em> as outlined in the two
diagrams above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Note that despite the strength of any other faculties within a
person, at the moment of full awakening wisdom predominates.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn145-1"><a href="#fn-fn145">145</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A simple definition for <em>kāya-sakkhī</em> is ’one who first attains
jhāna and later attains Nibbāna’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn146-1"><a href="#fn-fn146">146</a></sup> Note also that only a ’body
witness’ who is a non-returner is able to attain the eighth
liberation (<em>vimokkha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The commentaries and sub-commentaries state that
<em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em> are liberated in two ways: liberated from the
corporeal body (<em>rūpa-kāya</em>) by the formless attainments, and from
the mind-body (<em>nāma-kāya</em>) by the noble path. They are liberated on
two occasions: when suppressing (<em>vikkhambhana</em>) the defilements by
the power of concentration in jhāna, and when completely uprooting
(<em>samuccheda</em>) the defilements.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn147-1"><a href="#fn-fn147">147</a></sup> If <em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>
attain the threefold knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>), they are called <em>tevijja</em>.
If they attain the six <em>abhiññā</em> (’supreme knowledge’), they are
called <em>chaḷabhiñña</em>. If they attain the four penetrating insights
(<em>paṭisambhidā</em>), they are called <em>paṭisambhidappatta</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paññā-vimutta</em> practise primarily <em>vipassanā</em> meditation; they
practise <em>samatha</em> meditation only to have an adequate foundation
for insight. They therefore do not experience the exceptional fruits
of <em>samatha</em> beyond the first four jhānas; they do not attain the
formless jhānas, the ’attainment of cessation’
(<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>), the two <em>lokiya-vijjā</em> (’mundane knowledge’
– recollection of past lives and knowledge of the rebirth of
beings), nor do they attain the five mundane <em>abhiññā</em> (’supreme
knowledge’ – psychic powers, the ’divine ear’, telepathy,
recollection of past lives, and the ’divine eye’.)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn148-1"><a href="#fn-fn148">148</a></sup> In

ways of teaching: (a) explaining indirectly or limiting one’s
examination to particular aspects (<em>pariyāya</em>); and (b) explaining
directly, absolutely and comprehensively (<em>nippariyāya</em>). Of particular
relevance is the discussion on the two types of arahants:
<em>paññā-vimutta</em> and <em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>. <em>Ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em> are
liberated in both ways: they have attained arahantship and have also
attained the formless jhānas. <em>Paññā-vimutta</em> have attained arahantship,
but if they attain jhāna it is not higher than the fourth jhāna.</p>
<p>Although there are only these two types of arahants, people may get
confused when encountering, for example, the description of an arahant
as ’one liberated in mind’ (<em>cetovimutta</em>). For clarification,
<em>cetovimutta</em> is another name for <em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>; the term
<em>cetovimutta</em> simply emphasizes the preferred mode of practice (in this
case <em>samatha</em>) before reaching arahantship. It does not imply that
liberation was attained solely by concentration.</p>
<p>In some places, arahants who have practised <em>samatha</em> and <em>vipassanā</em> in
tandem are rather randomly assigned the names <em>cetovimutta</em> or
<em>paññā-vimutta</em> depending on which faculty was stronger. For example,
the commentaries call Ven. Sāriputta a <em>paññā-vimutta</em> and Ven. Mahā
Moggallāna a <em>cetovimutta</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn151-1"><a href="#fn-fn151">151</a></sup> On some occasions these two terms are
used together to describe a single arahant who has achieved both of
these ways to liberation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn152-1"><a href="#fn-fn152">152</a></sup> Another example of how terms are used in
different ways to describe arahants is in the Paṭisambhidāmagga, which
uses the fixed terms <em>saddhā-vimutta</em>, <em>diṭṭhippatta</em> and <em>kāya-sakkhī</em>
for practitioners all the way till the moment of full awakening.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn153-1"><a href="#fn-fn153">153</a></sup>
Failing to understand this indirect way of explaining can lead to
confusion; all of a sudden there are multiple types of arahants.</p>
<p>A similar confusion can arise when explaining other terms related to
Buddha-Dhamma. An example is the definition of right mindfulness
(<em>sammā-sati</em>) as equivalent to the Four Foundations of Mindfulness
(<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn154-1"><a href="#fn-fn154">154</a></sup> The Four Foundations of Mindfulness are
generally considered a comprehensive method of practice comprising all
spiritual qualities, including effort (<em>ātapa</em>) and clear comprehension
(<em>sampajañña</em>). A doubt then arises as to how the <em>satipaṭṭhāna</em> can be
confined to merely right mindfulness. In this case, <em>sammā-sati</em> is the
mindfulness suitable to or applied in the Four Foundations of
Mindfulness. {418}</p>
<p>Another example is the development of concentration, of which there are
four kinds.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn155-1"><a href="#fn-fn155">155</a></sup> The description of the fourth kind includes: <em>When
developed and expanded, this meditation leads to the destruction of the
taints</em>. One may wonder how concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), which is
equivalent to ’tranquillity’ (<em>samatha</em>), can lead to the destruction of
the taints without ’insight’ (<em>vipassanā</em>). Here, concentration must be
understood as the core of a person’s meditation practice, like a field
where various spiritual qualities gather to battle the
defilements.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn156-1"><a href="#fn-fn156">156</a></sup> The development of concentration in this context is
not isolated; it is used in conjunction with and as a support for other
meditation techniques.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn157-1"><a href="#fn-fn157">157</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="kinds-of-arahants"><a class="header" href="#kinds-of-arahants">Kinds of Arahants</a></h2>
<p>Of all the different kinds of noble beings (<em>ariya-puggala</em>) and those
persons worthy of offerings (<em>dakkhiṇeyya-puggala</em>) outlined above,
arahants are supreme. They have completed their training, developed
expertise (<em>asekha</em>), finished their spiritual cultivation (<em>bhāvita</em>),
and reached the goal. Nothing remains for them to do in respect to
personal wellbeing; instead, they act for others’ wellbeing, for the
welfare and happiness of the manyfolk, out of compassion for the world.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of arahants, who can be further subdivided
according to their special qualities:</p>
<p><strong>1. ’Those liberated through wisdom’ (<em>paññā-vimutta</em>):</strong> Arahants who
emphasize insight meditation, relying on concentration only to the
necessary degree for realizing the destruction of the taints. They do
not attain jhānas above the fourth jhāna; they do not have the
exceptional proficiency of the ’attainment of cessation’
(<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>) or the five mundane ’supreme knowledges’
(<em>abhiññā</em>):</p>
<div class="list-upper-alpha">
<ol>
<li>
<p>’Pure insight practitioners’ (<em>sukkha-vipassaka</em>): arahants who
exclusively practise <em>vipassanā</em>. They attain jhāna at the moment of
realizing the Path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those liberated through wisdom (<em>paññāvimutta</em>) who attain one of
the first four jhānas before practising insight meditation leading
to arahantship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paṭisambhidappatta</em>: arahants who attain the four penetrating
insights (<em>paṭisambhidā</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn158-1"><a href="#fn-fn158">158</a></sup></p>
<div class="list-decimal">
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Attha-paṭisambhidā</em>: clear insight into meaning (<em>attha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dhamma-paṭisambhidā</em>: clear insight into principles (<em>dhamma</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nirutti-paṭisambhidā</em>: clear insight into language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paṭibhāṇa-paṭisambhidā</em>: discriminating knowledge; being
perceptive and sharp-witted. {419}</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><strong>2. ’Those liberated in both ways’ (<em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>):</strong> Arahants
liberated from the body through the formless attainments and liberated
by mind through the noble path. They have two moments of liberation:
when suppressing the defilements by the power of concentration in jhāna
(<em>vikkhambhana</em>) and when uprooting the defilements with wisdom
(<em>samuccheda</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn159-1"><a href="#fn-fn159">159</a></sup></p>
<div class="list-upper-alpha">
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>: arahants who have attained at least one of
the formless jhānas but who have attained neither mundane direct
knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>) – see below – nor mundane supreme knowledge
(<em>abhiññā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tevijja</em>: arahants who have attained the three kinds of direct
knowledge (<em>vijjā</em>):</p>
<div class="list-decimal">
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Pubbenivāsānussati-ñāṇa</em>: recollection of past lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cutūpapāta-ñāṇa</em>: knowledge of the decease and rebirth of
beings according to their kamma. Equivalent to the ’divine eye’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Āsavakkhaya-ñāṇa</em>: knowledge of the truth resulting in the
destruction of the taints (<em>āsava</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Chaḷabhiñña</em>: arahants with the six supreme knowledges (<em>abhiññā</em>):</p>

four penetrating insights (<em>paṭisambhidā</em>).</p>

</div>
<p>After this subdivision a list of arahants looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sukkhavipassaka</em>: pure insight practitioners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paññāvimutta</em>: those liberated by wisdom (apart from
<em>sukkhavipassaka</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>: those liberated both ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tevijja</em>: those with the three kinds of direct knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Chaḷabhiñña</em>: those with the six kinds of supreme knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paṭisambhidappatta</em>: those who have attained the four penetrating
insights.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn160-1"><a href="#fn-fn160">160</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An arahant who is both a <em>chaḷabhiñña</em> and a <em>paṭisambhidappatta</em> is
considered perfected in spiritual powers. {420}</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Anuruddha:</p>
<p>’Friend Anuruddha, it is said: “A trainee, a trainee.” In what way,
friend, is one a trainee?’</p>
<p>’It is, friend, because one has partly developed the Four Foundations
of Mindfulness that one is a trainee….’</p>
<p>’Friend Anuruddha, it is said: “One beyond training, one beyond
training.” In what way, friend, is one beyond training?’</p>
<p>’It is, friend, because one has completely developed the Four
Foundations of Mindfulness that one is beyond training.’</p>
<p><em>S. V. 175.</em></p>
<p>Bhikkhus, I do not say of all bhikkhus that they still have work to do
with diligence in regard to the six bases for contact, nor do I say of
all bhikkhus that they do not have work to do with diligence in regard
to the six bases for contact.</p>
<p>I do not say of those bhikkhus who are arahants, whose taints are
destroyed … and are completely liberated through final knowledge,
that they still have work to do with diligence in regard to the six
bases for contact. Why is that? They have done their work with
diligence; they are incapable of being negligent.</p>
<p>But I say of those bhikkhus who are trainees, who have not attained
arahantship, who dwell aspiring for the unsurpassed security from
bondage,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn161-1"><a href="#fn-fn161">161</a></sup> that they still have work to do with diligence in
regard to the six bases for contact. Why is that? There are, bhikkhus,
forms (sounds, etc.) cognizable by the eye (ear, etc.) that are
agreeable and those that are disagreeable. When these forms are
experienced, they cannot obsess the mind of a bhikkhu [who is
heedful]. When the mind is not obsessed, tireless energy is aroused,
unmuddled mindfulness is established, the body becomes tranquil and
untroubled, the mind becomes concentrated and one-pointed. Seeing this
fruit of diligence, bhikkhus, I say that those bhikkhus still have
work to do with diligence in regard to the six bases for contact.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 124-5.</em></p>
<p>Bhikkhus, there is a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is a
trainee, standing on the plane of a trainee, might understand: ’I am a
trainee’, while a bhikkhu who is one beyond training, standing on the
plane of one beyond training, might understand: ’I am one beyond
training.’</p>
<p>Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is a trainee understands as it really
is: ’This is suffering’…. ’This is the origin of suffering’….
’This is the cessation of suffering’…. ’This is the way leading to
the cessation of suffering.’ This is a method by means of which a
bhikkhu who is a trainee, standing on the plane of a trainee,
understands: ’I am a trainee.’ {470}</p>
<p>Again bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is a trainee considers thus: ’Is there
outside the Buddha’s dispensation another ascetic or brahmin who
teaches a Dhamma so real, so true, so certain (tatha) as the Blessed
One does?’ He understands thus: ’There is no other ascetic or brahmin
outside the Buddha’s dispensation who teaches a Dhamma so real, so
true, so certain as the Blessed One does.’ This too is a method by
means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee, standing on the plane of a
trainee, understands: ’I am a trainee.’</p>
<p>Again bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is a trainee understands the five
spiritual faculties – the faculty of faith, the faculty of energy,
the faculty of mindfulness, the faculty of concentration, the faculty
of wisdom. He does not yet dwell having contacted with the [mental]
body their destination, their culmination, their fruit, their final
goal; yet he sees with penetrative wisdom. This too is a method by
means of which a bhikkhu who is a trainee, standing on the plane of a
trainee, understands: ’I am a trainee’….</p>
<p>Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is one beyond training understands the
five spiritual faculties – the faculty of faith … the faculty of
wisdom. He dwells having contacted with the [mental] body their
destination, their culmination, their fruit, their final goal; and he
sees with penetrative wisdom. This is a method by means of which a
bhikkhu who is one beyond training, standing on the plane of one
beyond training, understands: ’I am one beyond training.’</p>
<p>Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is one beyond training understands the
six faculties – the eye faculty, the ear faculty, the nose faculty,
the tongue faculty, the body faculty, the mind faculty. He
understands: ’These faculties will cease completely and totally
without remainder, and no other six faculties will arise anywhere in
any way.’ This too is a method by means of which a bhikkhu who is one
beyond training, standing on the plane of one beyond training,
understands: ’I am one beyond training.’</p>

This is the trainee’s wisdom.</p>

concentration and wisdom, by realizing for himself with direct

what does he train in? He trains in the higher virtue, the higher
mind, and the higher wisdom.</p>

<p>Here, bhikkhu, one possesses a trainee’s right view, right intention,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, and right concentration. It is in this way that one is a
trainee.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>S. V. 327-8 describes the difference between a trainee’s abiding and the
Tathāgata’s abiding: trainees dwell having (incompletely) abandoned the
five hindrances; arahants have completely eliminated the five
hindrances. The Abhidhamma makes this distinction: the four
<em>magga-samaṅgī</em> and three <em>phala-samaṅgī</em> are <em>sekha</em>, arahants are
<em>asekha</em>, and the remainder are neither trainees nor beyond training

uprooted.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn168-1"><a href="#fn-fn168">168</a></sup> Sometime later he dwells contemplating rise and fall
in the five aggregates subject to clinging: ’Such is form, such its
origin, such its passing away; such is feeling … such is perception
… such are volitional formations … such is consciousness, such its
origin, such its passing away.’ As he dwells thus contemplating rise
and fall in the five aggregates subject to clinging, the residual
conceit ’I am’, the desire ’I am’, the underlying tendency ’I am’ that
had not yet been uprooted – this comes to be uprooted.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn169-1"><a href="#fn-fn169">169</a></sup> {474}</p>
<p>Suppose, friends, a cloth has become soiled and stained, and its
owners give it to a laundryman. The laundryman would scour it evenly
with cleaning salt, lye, or cowdung, and rinse it in clean water. Even
though that cloth would become pure and clean, it would still retain a
residual smell of cleaning salt, lye, or cowdung that had not yet
vanished. The laundryman would then give it back to the owners. The
owners would put it in a sweet-scented casket and the residual smell
of cleaning salt, lye, or cowdung that had not yet vanished would
vanish. So, too, friends … the residual conceit … comes to be
uprooted.</p>

<h2 id="factors-of-stream-entry"><a class="header" href="#factors-of-stream-entry">Factors of Stream-Entry</a></h2>
<p>So far the discussion has focused on those who have reached the highest
stage, of complete realization of Nibbāna. It is worthy, however, to
recognize the many individuals, especially householders, who have
’entered the stream’ to Nibbāna or have caught a glimpse of Nibbāna.
These individuals often have spouses and children, conducting their
lives virtuously in the wider world.</p>
<p>In modern times, people’s understanding of and feeling for Nibbāna and
enlightened beings has changed considerably. The view held by many
people in the past of Nibbāna as a heavenly city of eternal bliss has
changed into a view of extinction. Having less contact with Buddhist
teachings and being influenced more by materialism has led people to see
Nibbāna in a negative light, as something to be avoided. At the very
least they see Nibbāna as something distant and without relevance to
their lives. To address this problem, apart from instilling a correct
understanding of Nibbāna, people should be encouraged to take special
interest in the first stage of enlightenment – of stream-entry. The
importance of stream-entry goes beyond an academic interest in Nibbāna
and enlightened beings, but it often gets overlooked. The Buddha
repeatedly taught:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, those for whom you have compassion and those who are
receptive – whether friends or colleagues, relatives or kinsmen –
these you should exhort, settle and establish in the four factors of
stream-entry.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn172-1"><a href="#fn-fn172">172</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. V. 364-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The life of a stream-enterer does not appear alien or frightening to
contemporary people; rather, it appears admirable. Many of the
stream-enterers at the time of the Buddha were lay disciples and were
exemplary people. They were virtuous, led contented family lives, and
were engaged in society, helping their community and the Buddhist
religion. Although stream-enterers have reached a level of realization,
they still possess a subtle degree of defilement. They still grieve and
lament when encountering separation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn173-1"><a href="#fn-fn173">173</a></sup> They still have preferences
and aversions like unawakened people, although these are attenuated and
do not lead to serious misconduct. Their suffering is minor compared to
the suffering they have abandoned. They are firmly established and
secure in a happy, wholesome and faultless life. {882}</p>
<p>Prominent stream-enterers from the Buddha’s time include: Bimbisāra,
King of Magadha, who offered Veḷuvana, the first Buddhist monastery, and
who kept the weekly Observance Day precepts;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn174-1"><a href="#fn-fn174">174</a></sup> Anāthapiṇḍika,
founder of the famous monastery of Jetavana and incomparable benefactor
to the monastic community and to the poor;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn175-1"><a href="#fn-fn175">175</a></sup> Visākhā, foremost
lay-woman supporter, who was renowned in the Kosala country – she was
very active in promoting social welfare despite having twenty children
of her own;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn176-1"><a href="#fn-fn176">176</a></sup> Jīvaka-Komārabhacca, celebrated physician of King
Bimbisāra, of the Buddha, and of the monastic community, who is revered
by traditional medicine practitioners to this day;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn177-1"><a href="#fn-fn177">177</a></sup> Nakulapitā and
Nakulamātā, husband and wife who were utterly faithful to each other
into old age and vowed to meet again in future lifetimes.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn178-1"><a href="#fn-fn178">178</a></sup></p>
<p>The attribute of a stream-enterer that was mentioned earlier is the
abandonment of the first three fetters (<em>saṁyojana</em>) –
personality-view, doubt, and attachment to rules and religious
practices. Freedom from these fetters focuses on the absence of certain
qualities. There is, however, much emphasis in the scriptures on
positive, active qualities. There are many of these active qualities,
but essentially they can be incorporated into a group of five qualities:
faith (<em>saddhā</em>), moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>), learning (<em>suta</em>), generosity
(<em>cāga</em>), and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). Below is a description of the attributes
of stream-enterers, both in terms of active, present qualities and of
abandoned qualities.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn179-1"><a href="#fn-fn179">179</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="active-qualities"><a class="header" href="#active-qualities">Active Qualities</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Faith: stream-enterers possess a firm trust in truth, goodness, and
the law of cause and effect. They have confidence in wisdom, that it
is possible for human beings to overcome suffering by realizing the
conditioned nature of reality. They have faith in the virtuous
people who follow this path of wisdom and have a profound respect
for the Triple Gem (<em>ratanattaya</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn180-1"><a href="#fn-fn180">180</a></sup> Their faith is secure and
unshakeable because it is rooted in true understanding. {883}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral Conduct: their behaviour through body and speech is
appropriate and their mode of livelihood is honest and upright.
Their conduct is ’free’; it is not enslaved by craving (see
Note <a href="#free-conduct">Free Conduct</a>). They act in accord with truth to promote
virtue, simplicity, dispassion, peace, and concentration. Generally
speaking, this means following the five precepts, which is
considered perfect moral conduct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning: ’those learned in spiritual knowledge’ (<em>sutavant</em>); they
have studied the ’noble teachings’ (<em>ariya-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn181-1"><a href="#fn-fn181">181</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generosity: they delight in giving and sharing; they relinquish what
they have for others; they are not stingy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wisdom: they possess the knowledge of a ’learner’ (<em>sekha</em>): they
see clearly into the Four Noble Truths, Dependent Origination, and
the three characteristics; they abandon all wrong view
(<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>); they have no doubt concerning the Four Noble
Truths; they know the world as it truly is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social Action: stream-enterers abide by the ’virtues conducive to
communal life’ (<em>sārāṇīya-dhamma</em>), which engender social unity and
concord. They do this perfectly because they maintain the last
virtue (of right view, below), which connects all the others. These
virtues are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Physical acts of lovingkindness (<em>mettā-kāyakamma</em>); mutual
assistance and respect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verbal acts of lovingkindness (<em>mettā-vacīkamma</em>);
well-intentioned advice and instruction; well-mannered speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thoughts of lovingkindness (<em>mettā-manokamma</em>); thinking well of
others; wishing to assist others; cheerful demeanour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distributing lawful gains with others
(<em>sādhāraṇa-bhogitā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn182-1"><a href="#fn-fn182">182</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possessing a similar virtuous conduct as one’s companions
(<em>sīla-sāmaññatā</em>); acting in an agreeable manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing right, noble views with one’s companions
(<em>diṭṭhi-sāmaññatā</em>), which lead to the end of suffering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the scriptural passages that describe ’noble views’ (of virtue 6)
there are two special characteristics mentioned of stream-enterers:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If they have transgressed the discipline (<em>vinaya</em>), it is their
nature to confess this transgression without delay to their
teacher or wise companions and to show restraint in the future.
This restraint is similar to that shown by a young child who has
touched a burning coal and immediately retracts his hand. {884}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although stream-enterers endeavour to assist their companions
with various activities, they have a keen interest for training
in the higher virtue, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.
Just as a cow with a new calf, while she grazes watches her
calf, so too does a stream-enterer look to both the collective
good and to personal progress on the path.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn183-1"><a href="#fn-fn183">183</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness: stream-enterers have begun to experience transcendent
happiness, which is profound and independent of material things.
They have realized ’noble liberation’ (<em>ariya-vimutti</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Free Conduct</span><a id="free-conduct"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>’Free’ conduct is conduct from which one does not wish for personal
gain, say worldly pleasure or a heavenly birth. Note that good conduct
always includes right livelihood (<em>sammā-ājīva</em>) – see: VbhA. 88 =
Vism. 511. Of the many Pali words describing the moral conduct of
stream-enterers, there are two words in particular that have been
introduced into the Thai language: <em>ariyakanta-sīla</em>: conduct
cherished or praised by enlightened beings; and <em>aparāmaṭṭha-sīla</em>:
conduct that has not been ’grasped onto’; conduct untainted by craving
and fixed views; conduct that springs naturally from virtue – one
need not attach to this conduct since no impurities exist that would
lead to its transgression.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3 id="abandoned-qualities"><a class="header" href="#abandoned-qualities">Abandoned Qualities</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Three Fetters:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>: the delusion in ’self’; the mistaken belief in
a ’self’, which leads to selfishness, conflict, and suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vicikicchā</em>: doubts and uncertainties concerning, for example,
the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, and the training. These
doubts prevent the mind from rousing energy and advancing on the
path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>: the misapplication of moral precepts,
rules, observances, and traditions; these rules are not used as
they are intended, as tools for developing such qualities as
tranquillity and concentration. Instead, they are tainted by
craving and fixed views, by seeking personal reward, enhancing
self-stature, or blindly following others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five Kinds of Selfishness (<em>macchariya</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn184-1"><a href="#fn-fn184">184</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Possessiveness in regard to one’s dwelling (<em>āvāsa-macchariya</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possessiveness in regard to one’s family, group, institution,
etc.; partisanship (<em>kula-macchariya</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possessiveness in regard to one’s wealth and good fortune
(<em>lābha-macchariya</em>); preventing others from sharing these
gains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jealousy about one’s reputation and social standing
(<em>vaṇṇa-macchariya</em>); displeasure when someone else competes for
one’s gain or beauty; intolerance when hearing praise for
others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possessiveness in regard to the truth (<em>dhamma-macchariya</em>):
possessiveness of knowledge and attainments; a fear that others
will gain knowledge or attain realizations that match or excel
one’s own.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn185-1"><a href="#fn-fn185">185</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four Biases (<em>agati</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn186-1"><a href="#fn-fn186">186</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bias caused by desire (<em>chandāgati</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bias caused by aversion (<em>dosāgati</em>). {885}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bias caused by delusion or stupidity (<em>mohāgati</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bias caused by fear (<em>bhayāgati</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn187-1"><a href="#fn-fn187">187</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defilement: they have abandoned coarse or acute greed
(<em>rāga</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn188-1"><a href="#fn-fn188">188</a></sup> hatred (<em>dosa</em>) and delusion (<em>moha</em>), which lead to
an unhappy existence; stream-enterers do not commit any serious
misdeeds which would lead to perdition; they are secure from
rebirth in ’states of woe’ (<em>apāya</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn189-1"><a href="#fn-fn189">189</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suffering: they have quelled mental suffering and misfortune arising
from transgressions of the five precepts; the suffering remaining
for stream-enterers is minor.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn190-1"><a href="#fn-fn190">190</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The active qualities and the abandoned qualities are two sides of the
same coin. The abandonment of personality-view occurs with a profound
understanding of the conditioned nature of reality. With the arising of
this understanding, doubt vanishes and a solid confidence based on
wisdom remains. At the same time, moral precepts are observed
appropriately, leading to ’conduct pleasing to awakened beings’
(<em>ariyakanta-sīla</em>). The attachment to rules and observances ends. When
a person develops generosity, selfishness wanes. Wisdom weakens the
force of greed, hatred and delusion, which in turn frees a person from
bias and clinging. The reduction of clinging leads to a release from
suffering and an experience of great joy.</p>
<p>Stream-enterers are endowed with virtue and happiness. There is adequate
virtue to ensure that they will not cause danger, distress or harm to
anyone; on the contrary, their behaviour will benefit both themselves
and others. This virtue is secure because it stems from thorough
knowledge, which leads to a new way of seeing the world. As for
happiness, stream-enterers have encountered a profound inner happiness
that is of tremendous value. Although they still experience sensual or
mundane pleasure, they are not carried away by this coarser form of
happiness; they will not sacrifice the refined happiness to increase
mundane happiness. Mundane happiness is balanced by transcendent
happiness. This transcendent happiness is both a consequence of and a
supporting factor for virtue; it is confirmation that a person will not
regress and it supports further spiritual growth.</p>
<p>Stream-entry is of great value to the person who has realized it and to
society. The Buddha assigned stream-entry to the first stage of
enlightenment; it is the point where life as an awakened being begins.
Stream-enterers are ’true disciples’; they are part of the ’noble
community’ (<em>ariya-saṅgha</em>), which is the ’crucible’ in which humanity
is refined. {886}</p>
<p>The Buddha greatly emphasized the importance of stream-entry and urged
his disciples to set it as a goal for their lives. He said that the
realization of stream-entry is better than going to heaven, being an
emperor, or attaining jhāna. A teacher who is free from sensual lust due
to the power of concentrative attainments and who leads his many
disciples to ’merge with Brahma’ in heaven is considered excellent, but
he is surpassed by the stream-enterer who still has sensual lust.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn191-1"><a href="#fn-fn191">191</a></sup></p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Better than ruling the whole world,<br />
Better than going to heaven,<br />
Better than lordship over the universe,<br />
Is reaching the stream of awakening.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn192-1"><a href="#fn-fn192">192</a></sup></em></p>
<p><em>Dh. verse 178.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Those people who feel that Nibbāna is too distant to reach, too
esoteric, too desolate or ethereal, should use the state of stream-entry
as a bridge for understanding, because stream-entry is closer to their
experience and easier to understand. At the same time, stream-entry is
directly linked to Nibbāna, as it is an entry into the ’stream leading
to Nibbāna’ or is a ’first glimpse’ (<em>paṭhama-dassana</em>) of
Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn193-1"><a href="#fn-fn193">193</a></sup> This dual-benefited approach is appropriate for
contemporary people and still accords with the Buddha’s principles.
Stream-entry should be the goal of individual practitioners and of the
Buddhist community as a whole. In the meantime, one can reach an
intermediate stage, as either a ’faith-devotee’ (<em>saddhānusārī</em>) or a
’truth-devotee’ (<em>dhammānusārī</em>, see
Note <a href="#note-devotees">Faith- and Truth-devotees</a>), whose members are considered to ’have
approached stream-entry’, ’dwell in the Path’, and ’progress without
falling back’, and are sometimes included as ’noble’ (<em>ariya</em>) or ’true
disciples’ (<em>sāvaka-saṅgha</em>).</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Faith- and Truth-devotees</span><a id="note-devotees"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>See the earlier section describing faith- and truth-devotees. Later,
the term ’small stream-enterer’ (<em>cūḷa-sotāpanna</em>) was coined,
referring to those disciples who have great love for and faith in the
Buddha but whose wisdom is not yet developed (see: M. I. 141-2). The
commentaries say this refers to those practitioners who have developed
insight and reached ’knowledge of recognition’ (<em>ñāta-pariññā</em>) and
the ’purity of transcending doubts’ (<em>kaṅkhāvitaraṇa-visuddhi</em>), and
who have attained an ease and sense of security. See: MA. II. 120;

<p>Those who hesitate or for some reason are delayed can dwell in the
preparatory stages of ’virtuous person’ (<em>kalyāṇa-puthujjana</em>, see
Note <a href="#note-virtous-person">Virtuous Person</a>), ’possessing beautiful
qualities’,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn194-1"><a href="#fn-fn194">194</a></sup> or ’learned noble disciple’ (<em>sutavā

teachings’ (<em>ariya-dhamma</em>); they have responded to the ’call’ of the
truth. They have escaped from the ’jungle’ (of confusion) and recognized
the starting point of the path. Although they may still falter, they
possess the necessary factors to begin the journey. At the outset, these
virtuous persons, whose faith, moral conduct, generosity and wisdom is
not yet truly secure, can generate the quality of ’learning’ (<em>suta</em>) –
of having ’listened’, of seeking knowledge – until they reach the stage
of ’great learning’ (<em>bahussuta</em>), of being steadfast in knowledge.</p>

begins.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn196-1"><a href="#fn-fn196">196</a></sup> Indeed, correct understanding leads to faith, moral
conduct, generosity and wisdom, because faith springs from such an
understanding, followed by the energy to cultivate other virtues. These
five qualities – learning, faith, morality, generosity and wisdom –
are called the five mundane ’accomplishments’ (<em>sampadā</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn197-1"><a href="#fn-fn197">197</a></sup> or the
five mundane ’treasures’ (<em>vaḍḍhi</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn198-1"><a href="#fn-fn198">198</a></sup> With the attainment of
stream-entry, these five accomplishments or treasures become
transcendent qualities.</p>
<p>A notable feature of stream-enterers is that they are not possessive of
their material wealth:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>[Stream-enterers] dwell at home with a mind devoid of the stain of
stinginess, freely generous … delighting in giving and sharing….
Whatever there is in their family that is suitable for giving, all
that they share unreservedly among those who are virtuous and of good
character.</p>
<p><em>S. V. 351-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Because of this unbounded generosity, stream-enterers grow in virtue but
may diminish in material wealth, and the Buddha even established a
training rule as a result of this trait. If the bhikkhu sangha sees that
members of a family have increasing faith but diminishing wealth, it can
formally assign them the title of <em>sekha</em> (’learner’), regardless of
whether they are actually enlightened or not. {888} (It is usually not
possible to determine the level of realization in another. Here,
behaviour is used as the standard.) If a monk who is not ill and has not
been previously invited goes to members of this family and eats their
food, he transgresses one of the training rules.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn199-1"><a href="#fn-fn199">199</a></sup></p>
<p>From this example, one can discern two important principles. First, this
training rule focuses on and declares a person’s inner, spiritual
qualities for the benefit of the community, by dictating a standard of
behaviour suitable to the circumstances. Second, it reveals how those
people who are endowed with certain qualities – whose faith is
correctly aligned with the Buddhist teachings, or who have realized the
Dhamma as stream-enterers – do not seek reward for their good deeds.
They do not chase after pleasurable sense objects for gratification.
These questions do not arise for them: ’I have done good; why don’t good
things come back to me?’ or: ’I have been generous; why am I not rich? I
haven’t got what I wanted.’</p>
<p>Stream-enterers possess not only the physical eye, which sees material
things, but they have developed the ’eye of Dhamma’
(<em>dhamma-cakkhu</em>)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn200-1"><a href="#fn-fn200">200</a></sup> or the ’wisdom eye’, which sees clearly into the
truth. They have complete confidence in the power of goodness, a
confidence that can never be shaken regardless of unfavourable material
circumstances. When they have clearly seen the truth and walked the
virtuous path, no one including devas can tempt them to deviate. They
are steadfast in virtue. The commentaries use the example of
Anāthapiṇḍika to show the degree of a stream-enterer’s rectitude.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn201-1"><a href="#fn-fn201">201</a></sup>
They cannot be enticed or intimidated by devas; on the contrary, devas
pay respect to them. {889}</p>

<p><em>Aveccappasāda</em> is sometimes translated as ’unshakeable faith’. I have
used the translation ’firm confidence with wisdom’ to expand the
meaning and to show the relationship of faith to wisdom. Wisdom is an
inherent component to a balanced spiritual practice that expresses
itself with ever greater clarity, until one no longer needs to refer
to the term ’faith’. At least one should understand that faith here is
based on wisdom. <em>Avecca</em> can be translated as ’knowing’, ’examining’,
and ’penetrating with wisdom’; see: D. III. 158; Kh. 4; Sn. 40, 66;
(explained at: DA. III. 933; KhA. 185; SnA. I. 277, 368). Compare with
<em>avicca</em> in the Rūpa Siddhi Pakaraṇa [16/17], and with <em>anuvicca</em> at

interpretation of <em>aveccappasāda</em>, see: AA. II. 333; AA. III. 363;

<p>Following DA. II. 537; AA. III. 345; VinṬ.: Parivāra-ṭīkā,
Antarapeyyālaṁ, Katipucchāvāravaṇṇanā, etc., the term <em>aparāmaṭṭha</em>
can be translated two ways: first, as ’irreproachable’: a person’s
conduct is flawless and no one can find true fault with it. Second, a
person’s conduct is not defiled by craving and fixed views – it is
pure and practised according to how moral conduct should be practised
– it has no ambiguity or hidden agenda, e.g. to gain personal
advantage or to attain status. This conduct is cherished by
enlightened beings (<em>ariyakanta-sīla</em>); the Buddha said this is the
supreme mode of conduct (A. III. 36).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Of these three criteria, the four factors of stream-entry are direct
attributes of stream-enterers. The remaining two criteria are a cause
and an effect of these four factors, respectively. Understanding the
’noble method’ (the law of Dependent Origination) is a cause for these
factors of stream-entry, because when wisdom sees this law of nature,
faith is stable and based on reason, and conduct is in accord with moral
principles. The first criterion is an effect, because when faith and
conduct reach this stage, the ’fearful retributions’ cease. Therefore,
the Pali Canon generally refers solely to the four factors of
stream-entry, as the constant attribute of stream-enterers:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, a noble disciple who possesses four things is a
stream-enterer, no longer bound to the lower world…. A noble
disciple possesses firm confidence with wisdom in the Buddha … the
Dhamma … the Sangha…. He possesses the virtues dear to the noble
ones … leading to concentration.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn209-1"><a href="#fn-fn209">209</a></sup></p>
<p><em>E.g. from S. V. 343 to S. V. 405.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The four factors of stream-entry are sometimes called a ’Dhamma-lens’ or
’Dhamma-mirror’ (<em>dhammādāsa</em>) for stream-enterers to use for inspection
and self-assessment.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn210-1"><a href="#fn-fn210">210</a></sup> They are sometimes called an ’ocean of
merit’, ’ocean of good fortune’, and ’food for joy’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn211-1"><a href="#fn-fn211">211</a></sup> At other
times they are referred to as supreme abidings for living happily in the
present (<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn212-1"><a href="#fn-fn212">212</a></sup> Virtuous conduct is
sometimes expanded into the three pure physical actions and the four
pure verbal actions, together referred to as the seven essential
qualities (<em>saddhamma</em>), and the factors of stream-entry are in this
case called the four ’desirable states’ (<em>ākaṅkhiya-ṭhāna</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn213-1"><a href="#fn-fn213">213</a></sup> In
some passages the factors of stream-entry are divided into the ten
’right states’ (<em>sammatta</em>): the Eightfold Path plus right knowledge
(<em>sammā-ñāṇa</em>) and right deliverance (<em>sammā-vimutti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn214-1"><a href="#fn-fn214">214</a></sup> {893}</p>
<p>An alternative presentation of the four factors of stream-entry replaces
moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>) with generosity (<em>cāga</em>):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A noble disciple who possesses four things is a stream-enterer…. A
noble disciple possesses firm confidence with wisdom in the Buddha …
the Dhamma … the Sangha…. He dwells at home devoid of the stain of
stinginess, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment,
one devoted to the requests of others, delighting in giving and
sharing….</p>

is shared unreservedly among those who are virtuous and of good
character.</p>

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>All of the attributes of stream-enterers fall under the qualities of
faith, moral conduct, learning, generosity and wisdom. For this reason,
the Buddha frequently encouraged his disciples to develop these
qualities and to use them as a measuring stick for the progress of
awakened beings. Likewise, he suggested they be used to measure the
progress of all his disciples, including those not yet enlightened:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, growing in five areas of growth, a male noble disciple grows
with a noble growth (ariyā vaḍḍhi), and he acquires the essence,
acquires the best, of this bodily existence. What are the five? He

<p>When he grows in faith, conduct, learning, generosity and wisdom, the
virtuous and knowledgeable male disciple acquires right here the
essence for himself.</p>
<p>Bhikkhus, growing in five areas of growth, a woman noble disciple
grows with a noble growth, and she acquires the essence, acquires the

<p><em>A. III. 80; S. IV. 250; cf.: A. V. 137.</em></p>
<p>A bhikkhu possesses faith, conduct, learning, generosity and wisdom.
He thinks: ’Oh, that by realizing for myself with direct knowledge, I
may here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and
deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the
taints!’ And by realizing for himself with direct knowledge, he here
and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and
deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the
taints.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn216-1"><a href="#fn-fn216">216</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>Even if a person has not mastered these five qualities, recollecting
someone else who has mastered them brings ease of mind and acts as an
incentive for spiritual practice: {894}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>A bhikkhunī hears thus: ’The bhikkhunī named so-and-so has died; the
Blessed One has declared of her: “She was established in final
knowledge [of arahantship].” ’ And she has either seen that sister
for herself or heard it said of her: ’That sister’s moral conduct was
thus, her qualities were thus, her wisdom was thus, her virtues were
thus, her deliverance was thus.’ Recollecting her faith, conduct,
learning, generosity, and wisdom, she directs her mind to such a
state. In this way a bhikkhunī has a happy abiding.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn217-1"><a href="#fn-fn217">217</a></sup></p>
<p><em>M. I. 466.</em></p>

wholesome qualities. I praise only growth in wholesome qualities –
not standing still, not declining.</p>
<p>And what is the decline of wholesome qualities, not standing still,
not growth? Here, whatever qualities a monk possesses of faith,
conduct, learning, generosity, and discerning wisdom, these qualities
do not remain constant and are not developed. This I call the decline
of wholesome qualities, not the standing still, not the growth…. And
what is the standing still of wholesome qualities…? Here, whatever
qualities a monk possesses of faith … wisdom, these qualities
neither decrease nor increase…. And what is the growth of wholesome
qualities…? Here, whatever qualities a monk possesses of faith …
wisdom, these qualities do not remain constant nor do they
decline.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn218-1"><a href="#fn-fn218">218</a></sup></p>

<p>There are several instances when the Buddha presented variant
definitions for some of these five qualities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Faith (<em>saddhā</em>): apart from the firm confidence with wisdom in the
three ’jewels’ as found in the four factors of stream-entry, the
Buddha often presented another definition:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And what is the accomplishment in faith? Here, a noble disciple
has faith; he has faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata
thus: ’The Blessed One is an arahant … the Awakened One, the
Blessed One.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn219-1"><a href="#fn-fn219">219</a></sup> {895}</p>
<p><em>E.g.: A. II. 66; A. III. 53; A. IV. 284, 288, 324-5, 363-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>): on many occasions, the Buddha defined moral
conduct very simply, as the five precepts:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Here, a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life, from
stealing, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from
wines, liquors and intoxicants which are a basis for
negligence.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn220-1"><a href="#fn-fn220">220</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>From the surrounding material it is fair to say that these two
passages on faith and conduct refer to ’noble’ disciples who have
not yet reached a stage of awakening, as will become clear from
additional quotations below.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn221-1"><a href="#fn-fn221">221</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning (<em>suta</em>): in addition to having encountered the noble ones
and being skilled in the noble teaching <em>(ariya-dhamma)</em>, as
mentioned earlier, the Buddha gave an alternative definition:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And what is the treasure of learning? Here, a noble disciple is
one of great knowledge, and bears in mind and retains what he has
learned. In these teachings, beautiful in the beginning, beautiful
in the middle, and beautiful in the end, which in spirit and
letter proclaim the absolutely perfected and purified holy life,
he is erudite, he remembers them, recites them, is well-versed in
them, and penetrates them with vision.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn222-1"><a href="#fn-fn222">222</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. III. 53.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generosity (<em>cāga</em>): there are normally no variant definitions from
that presented earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wisdom (<em>paññā</em>): apart from an understanding of Dependent
Origination, the Buddha presented definitions that can also be
applied to ’noble’ disciples who are not yet awakened:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And what is the treasure of wisdom? Here, a noble disciple is
wise, he possesses wisdom that penetrates arising and passing
away, which is noble and pierces defilement, leading to the
complete destruction of suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn223-1"><a href="#fn-fn223">223</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. III. 53.</em></p>
<p>And what is accomplishment in wisdom? One who dwells with a heart
overcome by covetousness and greed, by ill-will, by sloth and
torpor, by restlessness and worry, and by doubt does what he
should avoid and fails in his duty; as a consequence his fame and
happiness diminish. When a noble disciple thus understands that
these qualities are defilements of the mind, he abandons them.
When he has abandoned them, he is called a noble disciple of great
wisdom, of vast wisdom, one who sees the path of prosperity, one
endowed with wisdom. This is called accomplishment in
wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn224-1"><a href="#fn-fn224">224</a></sup> {896}</p>
<p><em>A. II. 67.</em></p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>One passage from the Pali Canon enumerates six qualities of a
stream-enterer:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>By possessing six qualities, the householder Tapussa [and twenty
other lay disciples] has reached certainty about the Tathāgata, has

delusion that leads to ruin…. It is impossible that one perfect in

<p>Shortly before the First Recitation, after the Buddha’s death, four
hundred and ninety-nine arahants were selected to attend along with Ven.
Ānanda, who was still a stream-enterer. He was invited because he had
spent a long time learning the Dhammavinaya directly from the Buddha,
and because he was a stream-enterer:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>It is not possible that he (Ven. Ānanda) could be biased due to likes,
dislikes, delusion, or fear.</p>
<p><em>Vin. II. 285.</em></p>
<p>Mahānāma the Sakyan approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him,
sat down to one side, and said to him: ’Venerable Sir, this city of
Kapilavatthu is rich and prosperous, populous, crowded, with congested
roads. In the evening, when I am entering Kapilavatthu after visiting
the Blessed One or the bhikkhus who are dear to the heart, I come
across a bustle of elephants, horses, chariots, carts and people. On
that occasion, my mindfulness regarding the Buddha becomes muddled, my
mindfulness regarding the Dhamma becomes muddled, my mindfulness
regarding the Sangha becomes muddled. The thought then occurs to me:
“If at this moment I should die, what would be my destination, what
would be my future state (abhisamparāya)?” ’</p>
<p>’Do not be afraid, Mahānāma! Do not be afraid, Mahānāma! Your death
will not be a bad one, your passing away will not be a bad one. When a
person’s mind has been refined over a long time by faith, conduct,
learning, generosity and wisdom, his body, consisting of form,
composed of the four elements, born from mother and father, built up
from rice and pudding, requiring scrubbing and massaging,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn233-1"><a href="#fn-fn233">233</a></sup>
subject to impermanence, to breaking apart and dispersal, is devoured
by crows, vultures, hawks, dogs, jackals and various creatures. {899}
But his mind, refined over a long time by faith, conduct, learning,
generosity and wisdom – that is elevated and reaches distinction….
Do not be afraid, Mahānāma! Do not be afraid, Mahānāma! Your death
will not be a bad one, your passing away will not be a bad one. A

<p>There are these six blessings in realizing the fruit of stream-entry:
one is firm in the good Dhamma; one is unable to fall back; one’s
suffering is limited; one is endowed with exceptional knowledge; one
has clearly seen into causes and the effects of causes.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn235-1"><a href="#fn-fn235">235</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. III. 442.</em></p>
<p>The person who is accomplished in view, freed from the vast plain of
misery, understands as it really is: ’This is suffering…’ ’This is
the origin of suffering…’ ’This is the end of suffering…’ ’This
is the path leading to the end of suffering.’ Therefore, you should
endeavour to [understand as it really is]: ’This is suffering…’
’This is the path leading to the end of suffering.’ (See

<p>’Bhikkhus, suppose that the great ocean would dry up and be destroyed
except for two or three drops of water. What do you think, which is
more: the water in the great ocean that has dried up and been
destroyed or the two or three drops that remain?’</p>
<p>’Venerable sir, the water in the great ocean that has dried up and
been destroyed is more. The two or three drops of water that remain
are trifling. They do not amount to a hundredth part, or a thousandth
part, or a hundred thousandth part of the water in the great ocean
that has dried up and been destroyed.’</p>
<p>’So too, bhikkhus, for a noble disciple, a person accomplished in view
who has reached the truth, the suffering that has been destroyed and
eliminated is more, while that which remains is trifling. It does not
amount to a hundredth part, or a thousandth part, or a hundred
thousandth part … as there is a maximum of seven more lives. Of such
great benefit is the realization of the Dhamma, of such great benefit
is it to obtain the Dhamma eye.’ (See

<p>’Venerable sir, Mount Sineru is more….’</p>

brahmins, wanderers, and followers of other sects do not amount to a
hundredth part, or a thousandth part, or a hundred thousandth part of
the achievement of a noble disciple, a person accomplished in view. So
great in achievement is a person accomplished in view, so great in

<p>The beginning of this sutta offers a comparison to demonstrate the
vastness of the plane of misery (<em>apāya</em>). At S. V. 342, there is a
comparison between a world-turning monarch and a stream-enterer: a
world-turning monarch, who is ruler of the four continents and after
death experiences the delights of heaven, but is not a stream-enterer,
is not safe from the hell realms or other planes of misery. A
stream-enterer, however, even if he lives on almsfood and is dressed
in threadbare robes, is safe from these planes of misery.</p>

earth, water on the tip of a blade of grass with water in a lake
hundreds of miles long and hundreds of miles deep, seven tiny balls of
clay with the entire earth, and seven tiny pieces of gravel with the
Himalayas. The same ten suttas (plus two more) occur at S. V. 457-65,

<blockquote>
<p><em>A noble disciple, one accomplished in view who has reached the
truth, understands as it really is: ’This is suffering’… ’This is

remains is trifling. Compared to the former mass of suffering that

<p>There is another group of four factors of stream-entry, but here, rather
than referring to the qualities of a stream-enterer, they are modes of
spiritual practice that lead to stream-entry:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> Sāriputta, this is said: ’A factor for stream-entry.’ What
now, is a factor for stream-entry?</p>
<p><em>Sāriputta:</em> Association with superior persons (sappurisa-saṁseva) is
a factor for stream-entry. Hearing the teachings of superior persons
(saddhamma-savana) is a factor for stream-entry. Proper reflection

</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These four qualities lead not only to stream-entry but to all levels of
wisdom, ending in the realization of arahantship. They may be referred
to by many other names, but because the Buddha emphasized them in this
context they are called the ’factors for stream-entry’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn240-1"><a href="#fn-fn240">240</a></sup> {902}</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Factors for Right View</span><a id="note-factors-view"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first three factors are factors for right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>).
<em>Sappurisa-saṁseva</em> = <em>kalyāṇamittatā</em>; <em>saddhamma-savana</em> =
wholesome ’learning from others’ (<em>parato-ghosa</em>). These factors for
right view are explained in the latter half of <em>Buddhadhamma</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em> is gradual, systematic and correct
practice: preliminary spiritual practices are conducive to subsequent
accomplishments. A correct practice of <em>sīla</em>, for example, leads to
the realization of Nibbāna; one does not follow rules blindly or act
from fixed views.</p>
<p>The Cūḷaniddesa (Nd. II. 70) offers examples of preliminary practices
(e.g.: moral conduct, sense restraint, moderation in eating, and
wakefulness) as well as subsequent accomplishments (or ’primary
teachings’), e.g.: the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Eightfold
Path (i.e. the Thirty-Seven Factors of Enlightenment –
<em>bodhipakkhiya-dhamma</em>).</p>
<p>One should observe the preliminary practices with a goal in mind, to
act in harmony with and be conducive to later stages of practice.</p>

<h2 id="additional-points-on-the-attributes-of-stream-enterers"><a class="header" href="#additional-points-on-the-attributes-of-stream-enterers">Additional Points on the Attributes of Stream-Enterers</a></h2>
<p>Let us look more closely at the five qualities of faith, moral conduct,
learning, generosity and wisdom, which incorporate the four factors of
stream-entry (<em>sotāpattiyaṅga</em>). The Buddha emphasized these qualities
and used them as benchmarks for progress in relation to ’noble
disciples’, both before the realization of stream-entry and after.
Special attention should be given to the quality of faith: why did the
Buddha mention faith every time he discussed this stage of practice,
even though Buddhism considers wisdom to be the supreme quality for
spiritual development?</p>
<p>These five qualities are referred to as the five ’accomplishments’
(<em>sampadā</em>), the five ’treasures’ (<em>dhana</em>), and the five qualities of
’growth’ (<em>vaḍḍhi</em>):</p>
<h3 id="faith-saddhā"><a class="header" href="#faith-saddhā">Faith (saddhā)</a></h3>
<p>Trust and conviction resulting from reasoned and wise contemplation.
There are three aspects to faith:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Faith in the Buddha: the existence of the Buddha is proof that
through their own efforts and by mindfulness and wisdom human beings
are able to realize the highest truth. Human beings can be trained
and cultivated, both in regard to proper conduct vis-à-vis their
external environment and in regard to spiritual qualities. They are
able to develop wisdom to the point that they escape from the
oppression by mental defilement and make an end of suffering,
realizing supreme deliverance. With this realization human beings
become excellent and self-reliant; they need not petition a divinity
(e.g. devas, Māra or Brahma) to intercede on their behalf. By
recognizing the exceptional virtues of the Buddha who has reached
this realization, a person with faith should cultivate these virtues
in him- or herself and try to reach the truth that the Buddha has
made known.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faith in the Dhamma – the Truth or the highest good – which the
Buddha discovered and revealed. {903} This truth is stable, certain
and autonomous; it is a natural law of cause and effect. It does not
rely on the appearance of a Buddha; it is neutral and impartial to
all beings. It invites investigation and spiritual practice. Every
person who has developed himself adequately and has sufficient
wisdom can realize this truth. This realization leads to liberation
and the end of suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Faith in the Sangha, the model community. This community acts as
proof that every person has the potential to realize the highest
truth realized by the Buddha. The community only comes into
existence, however, when individuals allow the truth to manifest
through spiritual practice. This community is made up of people
with different levels of maturity and development, but is unified by
the adherence to the same standards: they have the Dhamma as their
focus and standard of measurement and they are the vessels through
which the Dhamma manifests. One should treasure and participate in
the virtue of this community, because the Sangha acts more than any
other community to preserve the Dhamma in the world; it is the
source for goodness and wellbeing to spread in the world.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The three aspects of faith are: a trust that truth – a natural law of
cause and effect – exists; human beings are capable of realizing this
truth; and there are exceptional people who have reached this truth and
share it with others. Those who have confidence in this truth and in the
human potential to realize it will strive to generate the results,
especially through proper action. They believe in the causal link
between action and the fruits of action, and this belief leads to
steadfast ethical behaviour and a solid understanding. They do not rely
primarily on external forces for help. And they trust that together
people can build a virtuous or ideal community, which is made up of
individuals who have trained themselves and realized the truth of the
Buddha. By reflecting on causality, a person has a firm conviction that
the Buddha was truly awakened, that his teachings accord with the truth,
and that it is of utmost benefit to join the community of enlightened
disciples who have followed this teaching.</p>
<h3 id="moral-conduct-sīla"><a class="header" href="#moral-conduct-sīla">Moral Conduct (sīla)</a></h3>
<p>A moral code: the entire system of conduct covering both private
behaviour and one’s interaction with society through physical actions
and speech, including one’s livelihood. This code of conduct is
established to assist in the attainment of the highest good. Its aim is
to prevent unskilful actions and promote good actions by teaching people
to see the relationship between their deeds and their environment. It
brings about stability, both personal and social, and is a foundation
for higher spiritual practice. It helps to perfect physical and verbal
conduct and emphasizes harmonious coexistence. {904} Such a harmonious
social environment allows each individual to live at peace and to train
him or herself in order to reach higher states of realization.</p>
<p>For the general public, the basic code of conduct that supports
wellbeing is the five precepts: to not violate living creatures, to not
violate others’ property, to not violate loving relationships, to not
violate truth by speaking falsely or aggressively, and to not impair
mindfulness and clear comprehension (<em>sampajañña</em>) by using addictive
substances.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn241-1"><a href="#fn-fn241">241</a></sup> Certain communities establish more intricate and
refined codes of conduct, for example the eight precepts, the ten
precepts, and the two hundred and twenty-seven precepts, for an ordered
discipline and to reach the goal of that specific community.</p>
<p>There are several attributes of Buddhist morality:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>it creates a conducive external environment for spiritual practice
leading to the highest goal;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it promotes peace and harmony within a community, so that each
individual can pursue his or her activities in comfort; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the restraint of moral conduct leads to self-discipline and a
reduction of mental impurity. Moral conduct makes a person receptive
to wholesome qualities. In particular it is a basis for
concentration.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn242-1"><a href="#fn-fn242">242</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although there are levels of moral conduct higher than the five
precepts, all desirable codes of conduct required for Dhamma practice
(referred to as ’conduct cherished by the noble ones’ –
<em>ariyakanta-sīla</em>) share the same essence and have the same criteria:
they are followed neither out of desire for pleasurable rewards, nor out
of attachment, nor out of fixed views on morality, nor by blindly
following social customs. They are followed by understanding the true
purpose of moral precepts. For lay Buddhists who have this proper
perspective, observing the five precepts is enough to lead to
stream-entry.</p>
<h3 id="learning-suta"><a class="header" href="#learning-suta">Learning (suta)</a></h3>
<p>’That which is heard’; knowledge gained from listening, reading,
studying, news media, or any other sources; knowledge of the ’noble
teachings’ (<em>ariya-dhamma</em>) – the teachings of enlightened beings –
which reveal the highest way of life and the path to awakening.
Knowledge gained for careers and general activities in the world (for
example in the arts and sciences) is insufficient to become a ’noble
disciple’. {905} Worldly knowledge varies between different individuals
and it is not always harmless. Although it is developed to solve
problems and to generate happiness, often it has the opposite desired
effect and creates all sorts of complications. Therefore it is not the
same as the learning referred to here.</p>
<p>The knowledge of a noble disciple is always beneficial. It is the
knowledge that every person needs to lead a good life. It enables people
to apply professional knowledge to promote personal and social
wellbeing. It prevents harm and solves problems in a truly effective
way. And most importantly, it alone can lead an ordinary person to
become enlightened. For professional knowledge to be an effective tool
for solving problems it must be aligned with the knowledge of the noble
teachings. All these forms of knowledge, however, including the
knowledge of noble teachings, resemble at first a storeroom containing
raw materials. The knowledge has not yet been applied to truly settle
one’s affairs. After acquiring knowledge a person assimilates it and
makes it his own, as a particular view or belief. But for the knowledge
to be truly effective, it must become an instrument for wisdom, at which
point it develops into analytical and discriminative knowledge and is
integrated into systematic, comprehensive practice
(<em>dhammānudhamma-paṭipatti</em>).</p>
<h3 id="generosity-cāga"><a class="header" href="#generosity-cāga">Generosity (cāga)</a></h3>
<p>True giving; outward relinquishment by giving material things and inward
relinquishment by abandoning greed; an absence of stinginess. Noble
disciples do not seek reward (material gain, prestige, happiness or
heaven) in exchange for their gifts. The expression in the suttas,
’delighting in giving and sharing’ (<em>dānasaṁvibhāga-rata</em>), indicates
that noble disciples derive joy from the very act of giving. They do not
experience the suffering or disappointment from such thoughts as: ’I
have given but received nothing in return.’ Noble disciples are endowed
with lovingkindness and compassion. Without the urge to acquire or to
possess, the heart becomes expansive and sympathy for others arises. One
clearly sees other people’s hardship and suffering, and naturally
inclines to generosity. One finds joy in giving, by alleviating others’
suffering and making them happy. The goodness in the act of giving
becomes the reward. By giving, the world becomes a happier place. {906}
In addition, generosity purifies the heart, reduces mental impurities,
and leads a person closer to the goal of Buddhism.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn243-1"><a href="#fn-fn243">243</a></sup> As Ven.
Sāriputta said:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Wise persons do not give gifts for worldly happiness, nor do they give
gifts for a better rebirth. Wise persons give gifts to remove
defilement, to reach the state of no renewed existence.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn244-1"><a href="#fn-fn244">244</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Nd. I. 424-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Besides generous assistance in a wider context, noble disciples are
generous with their fellow companions. They willingly relinquish their
personal belongings for public consumption, to benefit the virtuous
members of their community.</p>
<p>Because noble disciples are ’superior persons’ (<em>sappurisa</em>), they give
the ’gifts of a good person’ (<em>sappurisa-dāna</em>). (See
Note <a href="#note-giving">Qualities of Giving</a>)</p>
<p>One of these qualities is to give respectfully; a noble disciple values
the recipient, the gift, and the act of giving. He gives willingly and
without resentment; no matter how low the recipient’s social standing,
he does not hold the person in contempt, acting with kindness and the
intention to help.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn245-1"><a href="#fn-fn245">245</a></sup></p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Qualities of Giving</span><a id="note-giving"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>These qualities consider the attributes of the donor, over and above
the needs of the recipient. There are several different groups of
these qualities:</p>
<p><strong>(A)</strong> Group of five:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>gives respectfully;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gives with humility;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gives with his own hand;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gives a pure gift (or does not give leftovers);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gives with the knowledge of the fruits of giving

<h3 id="wisdom-paññā"><a class="header" href="#wisdom-paññā">Wisdom (paññā)</a></h3>
<p>Comprehensive knowledge; clear knowing; discriminative knowledge;
reasoned analysis. A noble disciple distinguishes between true and
false, good and bad, right and wrong, appropriate and inappropriate,
benefit and harm. It is a practical knowledge; a person understands
causality and understands how to relate to conditions in order to solve
problems. This knowledge applies specifically to human suffering: it is
used to alleviate suffering and to live a good life. {907} There are
many ways to refer to this wisdom, including knowledge of the Four Noble
Truths, knowledge of Dependent Origination, and knowledge free from the
five hindrances (<em>nīvaraṇa</em>). The definition of the ’accomplishment of
wisdom’ (<em>paññā-sampadā</em>) as an attribute of a noble disciple is:
’Wisdom that penetrates arising and passing away, which is noble and
pierces defilement, leading to the complete destruction of
suffering.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn246-1"><a href="#fn-fn246">246</a></sup></p>
<p>No matter what level of expertise a person has in worldly knowledge, as
a prominent politician, brilliant businessman, clever inventor, or
skilled researcher, for example, the knowledge of a noble disciple is
indispensable for every person in solving life’s problems and living
honourably.</p>
<p>Learning (<em>suta</em>) can be a conditioning factor for wisdom: it provides
information and expands a person’s understanding. It is not only Dhamma
learning that supports wisdom; worldly knowledge, especially life
experience, can foster an understanding of the truth. A person skilled
in reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>) gains an understanding of the world
and of life from applying technical or professional knowledge. The
decisive factor for spiritual progress, however, is wisdom. Some people
are highly educated but are unable to reflect; they therefore do not
grow wise and do not truly benefit from their knowledge. Some people
have only a meagre level of formal education but are very wise; their
wise reflection enables them to solve problems. For a wise person,
increased knowledge of any kind is used to their advantage. Because a
wise person can still prosper despite a shortage of formal learning,
there are many occasions where the number of attributes of noble
disciples is reduced from five to four, leaving faith, conduct,
generosity and wisdom.</p>
<p>Wisdom fulfils not only learning (<em>suta</em>); it also validates all the
other factors of a noble disciple. Wisdom ensures that faith is correct,
not erring towards gullibility. Wisdom leads to suitable moral conduct,
which is praised by awakened beings and free from clinging to rules and
practices. Wisdom brings about true relinquishment, because as long as
one does not truly understand the world and phenomena, and one has not
discovered a more refined happiness, it is natural that one takes
pleasure in sensuality. With a lack of wisdom it is difficult to avoid
being preoccupied by worldly pleasures and to be generous without
wishing for some form of sense pleasure or other reward. Wisdom thus
unites the other factors; it is the essential factor of a noble disciple
and is the aim of each successive level of spiritual practice.</p>
<p>To sum up, there are four primary virtues of a noble disciple: {908}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Saddhā</em>: faith in the wisdom, virtue, and perseverance of human
beings; these qualities promote a realization of the truth and the
highest good as taught by the Buddha and his disciples. This faith
fosters the building of a virtuous society, established on
principles of truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla</em>: self-discipline, which leads to an appropriate behaviour and
relationship to others and to one’s environment. This conduct
supports the blossoming of virtue in an individual and fosters
social harmony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cāga</em>: relinquishment, which reduces selfishness and prepares a
person to assist others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Paññā</em>: wisdom; penetrative knowledge of things as they truly are,
as following laws of nature, as arising and passing away according
to causes and conditions. This knowledge accompanied by a free mind
promotes a proper relationship to things and an appropriate,
balanced conduct. A person then knows how to apply or develop the
other virtues in a suitable way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning (<em>suta</em>) acquired by any form – by instruction, encouragement,
advice, or study – supports the development of the other virtues and
brings about greater success, but the required amount of learning and
the level of success depends on a person’s ability to reflect with
wisdom.</p>
<p>Let us return to the first virtue of faith (<em>saddhā</em>) and examine how it
is a crucial factor at the beginning of spiritual practice. Normally,
faith is divided into three groups: faith in the Buddha, faith in the
Dhamma, and faith in the Sangha. Occasionally, a single, precise
definition is presented, especially when describing the faith of a noble
disciple before the realization of stream-entry: <em>[A person] has faith
in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: ’The Blessed One is an
arahant … the Awakened One</em>.’ This form of faith is called ’faith in
the Tathāgata’s awakening’ (<em>tathāgatabodhi-saddhā</em>, see
Note <a href="#note-faith-tathagata">Faith in the Tathāgata’s Awakening</a>). It is faith in the wisdom of the
Buddha, who is considered the archetype, representative, or pioneer for
all human beings.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s awakening confirms that all human beings are capable of
realizing the truth and reaching the highest good through mindfulness,
wisdom and disciplined effort. The Buddha compared himself to a baby
chick who is the first to peck its way through the eggshell of
ignorance,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn247-1"><a href="#fn-fn247">247</a></sup> and to a discoverer of an ancient path who reveals this
path to humanity.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn248-1"><a href="#fn-fn248">248</a></sup> Faith in the Buddha’s awakening is thus
equivalent to faith in the capability and wisdom of human beings. {909}
Or more succinctly, it is self-confidence or faith in oneself. This
confidence is not selfish belief or pride, but rather confidence in
being human or an objective trust in humanity. One believes in the human
potential for wisdom, that every person can reach the highest goal
through spiritual training and satisfy the greatest of human
aspirations.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn249-1"><a href="#fn-fn249">249</a></sup> The Buddha is the symbol of self-belief; he was the
first person to assert this human potential and the first person to not
attribute enlightenment to a divine or supernatural power.</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Faith in the Tathāgata’s Awakening</span><a id="note-faith-tathagata"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, ’faith in the wisdom of the discoverer of Truth’. It is
noteworthy that the Buddha uses the term Tathāgata here to refer to
himself, because there are many epithets for the Buddha and each one
emphasizes different qualities.</p>
<p>The use of the term Tathāgata here is consistent with the passage
where the Buddha describes the laws of nature, which exist
autonomously and are not dependent on the arising of Tathāgatas; a
Tathāgata is merely the discoverer and revealer of these truths (see:
A. I. 286; S. II. 25).</p>
<p>On many occasions the term Tathāgata is translated as a ’being’ (e.g.:
M. I. 426; S. IV. 395; explained, for example, at MA. III. 142).
Interested scholars may compare <em>bodhi</em> here with the concept of
Buddhahood in the Mahayana tradition.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Effectively, faith in the Buddha’s awakening encompasses faith in the
Triple Gem: there is trust that human beings can develop wisdom to the
point of resolving even the most refined difficulties in the heart, and
they are able to reach the highest liberation and complete happiness,
just as the Buddha was able to accomplish; there is trust that these
principles of practice and the highest goal are aspects of truth based
on natural laws; and there is trust that there are people who have
reached this goal, who comprise a noble community, have verified the
truth, propagate the Dhamma, spread blessings, and are fully prepared to
assist others in joining this noble community.</p>
<p>Although Buddhism advocates wisdom, faith is an essential quality at the
beginning stages of practice, before a person realizes his or her
potential and perfects wisdom. Faith here is different from what is
commonly understood and should not be mistaken for blind faith; it is
faith in wisdom, linked with wisdom, and leads to wisdom.</p>
<p>There are two important aspects to faith in the Triple Gem or to faith
in the Buddha’s awakening. First, the entire teaching in Buddhism,
either of the highest goal or of modes of practice, rests on the
principle that human beings are capable of following in the Buddha’s
footsteps and realizing the truth through their own effort and wisdom.
There exists no external, supreme source of power surpassing that of
human beings. If this principle were to be false, then the entire
Buddhist system of practice and the stated goal would be meaningless and
void. {910} Second, if a Buddhist disciple does not have trust in this
human potential, he will be unable to progress along the path of
Buddhism. How would he be able to devote himself to practice? In fact,
he would not be a true disciple of the Buddha. Faith in the Buddha’s
awakening is thus an essential quality for a Buddhist.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn250-1"><a href="#fn-fn250">250</a></sup></p>
<p>Stream-entry is a valid goal for Buddhist practitioners and reaching
this essential stage of awakening should be encouraged. The related
factors of faith, conduct, learning, generosity, and wisdom, which the
Buddha repeatedly taught, and when developed can be considered
equivalent to stream-entry, should also be emphasized. These five
factors can be developed gradually, both before the realization of
stream-entry and after, and they are relevant to the present time.</p>
<p>Today’s society is in need of faith that is based on reason not
credulity, and of trust in the human potential for reaching the highest
good.</p>
<p>Society requires an understanding of the true spirit of moral conduct,
as connected to other spiritual qualities; this conduct then guides and
protects society.</p>
<p>In today’s society there is an abundance of learning and a profusion of
information, but it often appears to create increased confusion and
difficulty for people. Society requires an education in noble principles
that reveals the essential meaning of life and points out ways of
disentanglement from problems; such learning leads to self-sufficiency
and suitable action. {911}</p>
<p>Today’s society faces increasingly dire economic problems, which require
self-sacrifice, generosity and mutual assistance coming from a pure
heart. The earth no longer has the resources to sustain people’s
unbridled greed. People need to discover the happiness that comes from
giving and sharing and that leads to social harmony.</p>
<p>Contemporary society is full of people who take pride in their
intelligence because they have received a formal education. They are
able to accomplish extraordinary things and wield a certain power over
nature and the environment. People have become expert at worldly
knowledge to the extent that their power is exceptional. But because
they lack transcendent wisdom, they have only begun to penetrate the
mysteries of the universe. As a result of pride, people risk falling
into a pit created by their own intelligence; they meet with obstruction
on the physical level and frustration in their hearts. To solve these
problems, people require noble wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn251-1"><a href="#fn-fn251">251</a></sup></p>
<p>Looking at the state of the world today and the widespread behaviour of
people, there are two outstanding qualities of a stream-enterer that
should be emphasized as guidelines for living:</p>
<p>First, stream-enterers have a firm understanding of the law of cause and
effect. Their trust in wisdom is adequately strong to expect successful
results from actions based on mindfulness and balanced effort, and in
line with causality.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn252-1"><a href="#fn-fn252">252</a></sup> They do not rely on fate or petition a
supernatural force from outside to intercede on their behalf. However,
because their wisdom is not yet complete, their confidence is not
self-sustaining. They still rely on someone else who has reached the
truth and leads the way. This is faith in the Buddha’s awakening or
faith in the Triple Gem. This is the highest and purest level of faith;
thereafter wisdom is perfected and replaces faith. The wisdom of
stream-enterers is not yet absolute; their wisdom is reinforced by
faith.</p>
<p>Second, stream-enterers are firmly established on the path to awakening.
Their understanding of the world is sufficient to not be influenced by
defilement nor to overrate worldly conditions (<em>loka-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn253-1"><a href="#fn-fn253">253</a></sup>
They have begun to experience transcendent joy and freedom, which brings
about an appreciation of the truth. They develop <em>chanda</em>: enthusiasm
and love for truth. They desire truth so much that there is no chance of
them returning to a fascination with material pleasures. Unlike ordinary
people, they seek no reward – of material gain, honour, fame, praise,
pleasure or heaven – from their virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>) or from acts
of generosity (<em>cāga</em>). Their moral conduct is steadfast; they are not
discouraged if they do not reap these aforementioned rewards. {912}</p>
<p>This Dhammapada verse illustrates the life of a stream-enterer:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Fear-stricken people in large numbers take refuge in mountains,<br />
Forests and sacred groves and trees.<br />
But no such refuge is safe,<br />
No such refuge is supreme.<br />
Not by resorting to such a refuge<br />
Is one freed from all misery.</em></p>
<p>One who goes for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha;<br />
Who sees clearly with wisdom:<br />
Suffering, the origin of suffering,<br />
The transcendence of suffering,<br />
And the Noble Eightfold Path leading to the end of suffering.<br />
This, indeed, is a safe refuge;<br />
This, indeed, is the refuge supreme.<br />
By reaching such a refuge,<br />
One is freed from all misery.</p>
<p><em>Dh. verses 188-92.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Let us return to the Buddha’s frequent teaching:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, those for whom you have compassion and those who are
receptive – whether friends or colleagues, relatives or kinsmen –
these you should exhort, settle and establish in the four factors of
stream-entry.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Leaders of a family, an organization, or a business who really deserve
the title of leader and fulfil their responsibility are able to foster
the five qualities of stream-entry in their relatives, dependents and
employees:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Supported by the Himalayas, a great tree grows in these five growths:
it grows in branches and leaves, in inner bark, in outer bark, in
sapwood, and in hardwood. So too, supported by a devout family leader,
members of a family grow in these five growths: they grow in faith,
moral conduct, learning, generosity, and wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn254-1"><a href="#fn-fn254">254</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. III. 44.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Besides encouraging general assistance to family and friends, the Buddha
gave a specific teaching concerning the factors of stream-entry in
reference to repaying the goodness of one’s parents:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>I declare, O monks, that there are two persons whose goodness it is
difficult to repay. What two? One’s mother and father. Even if one
were to carry one’s mother on one shoulder and one’s father on the
other, attending to them, until one reached the age of a centenarian,
reached the age of one hundred years; and if one were to care for them
by kneading, massaging, and bathing, and they would even void their
excrements there – even by that one would not do right by one’s
parents, one would not repay them. Even if one were to establish one’s
parents as the supreme lords and rulers over this earth rich in the
seven treasures, one would not do right by one’s parents, one would
not repay them. What is the reason for this? Parents have been of
great service to their children: they have nurtured, fed, and
introduced them to the world.</p>
<p>But one who encourages his unbelieving parents, settles and
establishes them in faith; who encourages his immoral parents, settles
and establishes them in moral conduct; who encourages his stingy
parents, settles and establishes them in generosity; who encourages
his ignorant parents, settles and establishes them in wisdom – such a
one does right by his parents, he repays them.</p>
<p><em>A. I. 61-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="appendix-1-sīlabbata-parāmāsa"><a class="header" href="#appendix-1-sīlabbata-parāmāsa">Appendix 1: Sīlabbata-parāmāsa</a></h2>
<p><em>Sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em> is one of the most misunderstood of the ten
fetters. {422} In the Suttanipāta, the Buddha often talks about the
wrong view of certain people who believe that purity is gained solely by
following moral precepts and religious practices.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn255-1"><a href="#fn-fn255">255</a></sup> The term
’purity’ (<em>suddhi</em>) here refers to the goal of the religious life,
equivalent to liberation (<em>vimutti</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn256-1"><a href="#fn-fn256">256</a></sup> This wrong view may manifest
in observing precepts and practices in order to go to heaven, as
revealed in this common passage from the suttas: <em>He has such a view as
this: ’By this moral precept or austerity or asceticism or celibate life
I shall become some kind of god or divine being.’</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn257-1"><a href="#fn-fn257">257</a></sup> Noble disciples
– the enlightened ones and true sages – do not hold this view and have
’let go’ of moral precepts and religious practices.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn258-1"><a href="#fn-fn258">258</a></sup> There are many
passages in the Mahāniddesa and Cūḷaniddesa explaining this attachment
to precepts and observances. For example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Some brahmins and ascetics equate purity with morality. They believe
that purity, immaculateness, liberation, deliverance, and freedom come
solely from moral precepts, abstinence (saññama), restraint (saṁvara)
and obedience…. Some brahmins and ascetics equate purity with
religious austerities. They observe the practice of behaving like
elephants (hatthi-vata), like horses (assa-vata), like cows (go-vata)
… they observe the rites of Brahma, of devas, of praying to the four
directions….<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn259-1"><a href="#fn-fn259">259</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Nd. I. 88-9. Cf.: Nd. I. 92-3, 188, 310; Nd. II. 11, 28.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This explanation helps clarify the definition of <em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>
from the Abhidhamma: <em>Sīlabbata-parāmāsa is this manner of view and
belief of ascetics and brahmins outside (of this Dhammavinaya): ’Purity
stems from keeping moral precepts and austerities.’</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn260-1"><a href="#fn-fn260">260</a></sup> The phrase
’outside (of this Dhammavinaya)<em>’</em> can lead some people to wrongly
understand that <em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em> is found only in other religions.
This passage from the Abhidhamma is merely an example; it can be
reworded as: <em>beliefs like those of other (non-Buddhist) ascetics and
brahmins</em>. In fact, one need not add these words ’other’ or ’outside’ at
all. The passages in the Suttanipāta, Mahāniddesa,<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn261-1"><a href="#fn-fn261">261</a></sup> or
commentaries<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn262-1"><a href="#fn-fn262">262</a></sup> do not use these words. For if a person clings to
this wrong view, even if one is Buddhist, one is ’outside’.</p>
<p>Besides being a deep-rooted misunderstanding, this blind faith in moral
precepts and religious practices reveals an inherent craving, for
example a wish to go to heaven.</p>
<p><em>Sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em> is composed of the words <em>sīla</em> (morality, moral
precept), <em>vata</em> (austerity, religious practice), and <em>parāmāsa</em>
(extreme attachment). The words <em>sīla</em> and <em>vata</em> are explained in the
Mahāniddesa, as defined above.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn263-1"><a href="#fn-fn263">263</a></sup> The Mahāniddesa elaborates by
saying that some things are both <em>sīla</em> and <em>vata</em>, while others are
<em>vata</em> but not <em>sīla</em>. For example, in the bhikkhu discipline (Vinaya)
those aspects having to do with self-control (<em>saṁyama</em> or <em>saññama</em>),
restraint (<em>saṁvara</em>), and moral integrity are <em>sīla</em>. Those aspects
having to do with vows or observances are <em>vata</em>. Examples of practices
that are <em>vata</em> but not <em>sīla</em> are the ascetic practices
(<em>dhutaṅga-vata</em>), e.g. vowing to live in the forest, eat only food
gathered on almsround, and wear rag-robes.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn264-1"><a href="#fn-fn264">264</a></sup> In regard to monks of
other traditions who keep for example the ’dog practice’
(<em>kukkura-vata</em>) in order to be reborn in heaven, the commentaries say
that <em>sīla</em> is the behaviour mimicking dogs and <em>vata</em> the particular
routines of such a practice.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn265-1"><a href="#fn-fn265">265</a></sup> In regard to Buddhists, an example of
<em>sīla</em> is keeping the five precepts and of <em>vata</em> is keeping the ascetic
practices.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn266-1"><a href="#fn-fn266">266</a></sup> In regard to bhikkhus, the commentaries occasionally
say that the four kinds of pure morality (<em>pārisuddhi-sīla</em>) are <em>sīla</em>
and the thirteen ascetic practices are <em>vata</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn267-1"><a href="#fn-fn267">267</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Parāmāsa</em> is sometimes translated as ’caress’ or ’fondle’ but its
general meaning in the Pali Canon is ’seize’ or ’take hold’, e.g.: a
monk ’grabs hold’ of a layman;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn268-1"><a href="#fn-fn268">268</a></sup> Dīghāvu ’holds’ the king of Kāsi’s
head to kill him;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn269-1"><a href="#fn-fn269">269</a></sup> the Buddha is not ’attached’ to what he
knows;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn270-1"><a href="#fn-fn270">270</a></sup> one should not ’take’ that which is not freely given;<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn271-1"><a href="#fn-fn271">271</a></sup>
’seizing’ rods and swords to fight.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn272-1"><a href="#fn-fn272">272</a></sup> {423} The definition of
’caress’ probably comes from the Jātaka stories describing the birth of
Suvaṇṇasāma, Kusa and Maṇḍavya, where a holy man touches the mothers’
navels.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn273-1"><a href="#fn-fn273">273</a></sup> Perhaps it is also influenced by Vin. I. 121 which defines
<em>parāmasanā</em> as ’stroke’ or ’rub’ (<em>ito cito ca sañcopanā</em>). The
principal meaning of <em>parāmāsa</em>, however, is clearly defined as:
<em>sabhāvaṁ atikkamitvā parato āmasatīti parāmāso</em> – ’to grasp at,
exceed, and deviate from reality’. One overreaches, by exceeding or
distorting the truth, making more of something than it actually
is.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn274-1"><a href="#fn-fn274">274</a></sup> For example, one may mistakenly believe something to be
permanent which is in fact fleeting. Precepts and religious practices
are established as a foundation for spiritual development; but one may
miss the point and believe that liberation comes merely from keeping
these rules and practices.</p>
<p><em>Sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em> is a belief or view (<em>diṭṭhi</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn275-1"><a href="#fn-fn275">275</a></sup> One may ask
how this fetter is distinct from the first fetter – <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em> –
which is also a belief. The commentaries explain that <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em>,
the firm belief in ’self’, is a view inherent in most people and does
not require logical reasoning or transmission from others.
<em>Sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em> has an external or social context; it is related to
what a person considers right and wrong conduct.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn276-1"><a href="#fn-fn276">276</a></sup> Because it
pertains to spiritual practice, the commentaries thus designate
<em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em> under the category of ’self-mortification’
(<em>attakilamathānuyoga)</em>, one of the two extremes to be avoided by
Buddhists in order to walk the Middle Way.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn277-1"><a href="#fn-fn277">277</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Parāmāsa</em> is often found in the past participle form as <em>parāmaṭṭha</em>
(’touched’, ’grasped’), and has the meaning of defiled or tainted.
Something is tainted because it has been ’smeared’ by craving: one keeps
rules and precepts to gain a reward (wealth, fame, praise, bliss, etc.)
or to be reborn in whatever state one’s religion professes. Pure
morality is called <em>aparāmaṭṭha</em>: it is not stained by craving. One
follows moral standards with wisdom and independence; one is not
enslaved to craving and fixed views. This is the <em>sīla</em> of
stream-enterers.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn278-1"><a href="#fn-fn278">278</a></sup></p>
<p>A further consequence of this attachment to rules and practices is the
debate between people about who is right and wrong. It can generate
arrogance and conceit, looking down on those who are deemed less strict
or less ethical.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn279-1"><a href="#fn-fn279">279</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em> results from people unquestioningly following
others; a symptom of the blind leading the blind. Some people see rules
and practices as sacred or magical rites or ceremonies. Others follow
the rules unwillingly, seeing them as arbitrary commandments; they do
not see the harm in transgressing the rules nor do they see the benefits
of restraint. Others again seek good luck or sensual pleasures by
observing these rules and practices.</p>
<p>Keeping moral precepts and observing religious duties correctly is not
<em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>. One knows their true purpose, that they should be
used for spiritual training, as a basis for concentration, for peace and
simplicity, and to promote goodness in society. One sees clearly the
harm in oppression of others. One follows moral precepts willingly by
having insight into their benefits, feeling shame in doing wrong, and
generating enthusiasm for the good. Eventually true moral conduct
becomes automatic and natural; no training or compulsion is required
because the defilements that cause evil are gone.</p>
<p>Non-violence is one of the six devotions practised by arahants, not
because they cling to rules and practices but because they are free from
greed, hatred and delusion.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn280-1"><a href="#fn-fn280">280</a></sup> {424} At first, moral behaviour is
normal behaviour because of habit and the strength of one’s
determination. Later, moral behaviour is normal behaviour because the
causes for evil and unwholesomeness have all been eliminated. Someone
who keeps moral precepts correctly is called <em>sīlavatūpapanna</em> (’endowed
with ethics’)<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn281-1"><a href="#fn-fn281">281</a></sup> or <em>sīlabbata-sampanna</em> (’perfect in
morality’).<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn282-1"><a href="#fn-fn282">282</a></sup> To say that purity is gained by moral precepts is
inaccurate, but to say purity is gained without moral precepts is also
inaccurate.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn283-1"><a href="#fn-fn283">283</a></sup> Religious observances and ceremonies may not be a
required part of spiritual practice, especially for the laity, but pure
(<em>aparāmaṭṭha</em>) morality – not diverging from truth and unblemished by
craving – is an essential basis for liberation.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn284-1"><a href="#fn-fn284">284</a></sup></p>
<p>Here is a way of measuring conduct: if by keeping precepts and religious
practices unwholesome qualities increase and wholesome qualities wane
then that conduct is incorrect; but if wholesome qualities increase and
unwholesome qualities wane then that conduct will bear good fruit.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn285-1"><a href="#fn-fn285">285</a></sup></p>
<p>As long as one is unawakened (<em>puthujjana</em>) there will be some degree of
clinging to and mistaken application of moral precepts and religious
practices, commensurate with one’s share of craving, wrong view, and
delusion. At least one will need to check and counter certain impulses.
For stream-enterers coarse defilements have been quelled and they are
thus called ’perfect in moral conduct’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn286-1"><a href="#fn-fn286">286</a></sup> They uphold rules and
observances in just the right way, neither too laxly nor too strictly.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-2-the-link-between-the-fourfold-self-mastery-bhāvita-and-the-four-kinds-of-development-bhāvanā"><a class="header" href="#appendix-2-the-link-between-the-fourfold-self-mastery-bhāvita-and-the-four-kinds-of-development-bhāvanā">Appendix 2: The Link Between the Fourfold Self-Mastery (bhāvita) and the Four Kinds of Development (bhāvanā)</a></h2>
<p>{383} In the Tipiṭaka, although there are many passages in which the
Buddha mentions as a group the four aspects of an arahant’s complete
development – i.e. he or she has gained self-mastery in body
(<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>), virtue (<em>bhāvita-sīla</em>), mind (<em>bhāvita-citta</em>), and
wisdom (<em>bhāvita-paññā</em>) – there is no single passage in which these
four factors are defined together. There exist only cases in which one
or a few of these factors are defined in specific circumstances, for
example by correcting a misunderstanding about one or more of these
aspects of development. This may be because at the Buddha’s time his
disciples were familiar with these terms and there was thus no need to
define them. (The passages containing definitions tend to be answers or
explanations the Buddha gave to non-Buddhists, for example to wanderers
and ascetics of other traditions.)</p>
<p>Similarly, the four kinds of development (<em>bhāvanā</em>) – which lead to
self-mastery (<em>bhāvita</em>) – are not found together as a group in the
Tipiṭaka, unless one counts the Burmese edition, which includes the
Peṭakopadesa. This text includes the passage: ’By way of the Eightfold
Path one also obtains the four kinds of development: moral development
(<em>sīla-bhāvanā</em>), physical development (<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>), mental
development (<em>citta-bhāvanā</em>), and wisdom development
(<em>paññā-bhāvanā</em>).’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn287-1"><a href="#fn-fn287">287</a></sup></p>
<p>Other passages in the Tipiṭaka mention at most three kinds of
development. Following on from the threefold training, the Saṅgīti Sutta
arranges three kinds of development as follows: ’The threefold training
entails the training in higher virtue (<em>adhisīla-sikkhā</em>), the training
in higher mind (<em>adhicitta-sikkhā</em>), and the training in higher wisdom
(<em>adhipaññā-sikkhā</em>); the three kinds of development entail physical
development, mental development, and wisdom development’.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn288-1"><a href="#fn-fn288">288</a></sup> Note
also that the term <em>sīla-bhāvanā</em> does not appear at all in the Tipiṭaka
(apart from the Peṭakopadesa mentioned above). The term <em>sīla-bhāvanā</em>
thus only exists inherent in the term <em>bhāvita-sīla</em>.</p>
<p>In contrast, the commentaries frequently mention all four aspects of
self-mastery (<em>bhāvita</em>) and all four kinds of development (<em>bhāvanā</em>)
as unified groups, and provide a fair number of explanations for these
terms. These explanations, however, sometimes conflict with one another.</p>
<p>The terms <em>citta-bhāvanā</em> and <em>paññā-bhāvanā</em> tend not to be a problem
and are well understood. The confusion and contradictions tend to arise
in regard to the terms <em>kāya-bhāvanā</em> and <em>sīla-bhāvanā</em> (and in
extension to the terms <em>bhāvita-kāya</em> and <em>bhāvita-sīla</em>).</p>
<p>The Peṭakopadesa (cited above) seems to give definitions variant from
other texts for all four kinds of development (<em>bhāvanā</em>). Note the
following passage: ’In respect to the four kinds of development, by way
of right effort and right livelihood the body is developed, by way of
right speech and right effort moral conduct is developed, by way of
right thought and right concentration the mind is developed, by way of
right view and right mindfulness wisdom is developed. By way of these
four kinds of development, these two factors come to fulfilment: the
mind (<em>citta</em>) and wisdom (<em>paññā</em>).’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn289-1"><a href="#fn-fn289">289</a></sup></p>
<p>Let us compare this passage with the Nettipakaraṇa (which is also
included in the Burmese Tipiṭaka). Here, the four kinds of development
(<em>bhāvanā</em>) are not explained, but the fourfold self-mastery
(<em>bhāvita</em>), which is inherently connected to the kinds of development,
is explained. One will see that here the explanation contradicts that of
the Peṭakopadesa: ’Of the three groups (<em>khandha</em>), the body of morality
(<em>sīla-khandha</em>) and the body of concentration (<em>samādhi-khandha</em>)
constitute tranquillity meditation (<em>samatha</em>), while the body of wisdom
(<em>paññā-khandha</em>) constitutes insight meditation (<em>vipassanā</em>)…. That
monk is developed in body, developed in moral conduct, developed in
mind, developed in wisdom. When the body is developed, two factors are
developed: right action and right effort; when moral conduct is
developed, two factors are developed: right speech and right livelihood;
when the mind is developed, two factors are developed: right mindfulness
and right concentration; when wisdom is developed, two factors are
developed: right view and right thought.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn290-1"><a href="#fn-fn290">290</a></sup> {384}</p>
<p>Note that the terms <em>bhāvanā</em> and <em>bhāvita</em> can also be translated as
cultivation / (fully) cultivated or training / (fully) trained. The
scriptures use the term <em>vaḍḍhanā</em> as a synonym for these terms, for
example: <em>bhāvita-kāyoti vaḍḍhita-kāyo</em><sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn291-1"><a href="#fn-fn291">291</a></sup> and <em>bhāvita-sīloti
vaḍḍhita-sīlo</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn292-1"><a href="#fn-fn292">292</a></sup></p>
<p>Most of the commentarial explanations conform with the Nettipakaraṇa,
which seem to be at odds with the Peṭakopadesa. Take for example a
passage from the commentaries of the Nettipakaraṇa itself: ’With the
fulfilment of excellent moral conduct (<em>abhisamācārika-sīla</em>), one is
developed in body (<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>); with the fulfilment of moral conduct
fundamental to the holy life (<em>ādibrahmacariyaka-sīla</em>), one is
developed in virtue (<em>bhāvita-sīla</em>). Moreover, by way of sense
restraint (<em>indriya-saṁvara</em>) one is developed in the body (of the five
doorways) – <em>bhāvita-(pañcadvāra)-kāya</em>; by way of other forms of moral
conduct one is developed in virtue.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn293-1"><a href="#fn-fn293">293</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentaries to the Aṅguttara Nikāya offer a similar yet distinctive
explanation: ’By way of physical development (<em>kāya-bhāvanā</em>), that is,
by contemplation of the body (<em>kāyānupassanā</em>), one is called developed
in body (<em>bhāvita-kāya</em>)…. Moreover, by developing the five doorways
(<em>pañcadvāra</em>) one is developed in body. The term ’developed in body’
refers here to virtue as sense restraint (<em>indriyasaṁvara-sīla</em>); the
term ’developed in moral conduct’ (<em>bhāvita-sīla</em>) refers to the three
remaining kinds of virtue.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn294-1"><a href="#fn-fn294">294</a></sup> Other commentaries and
sub-commentaries contain infrequent explanations of the terms <em>bhāvanā</em>
and <em>bhāvita</em>. For example, the commentaries to the Saṁyutta Nikāya
states: ’The term <em>bhāvita-kāya</em> refers to the body endowed with the
five doorways.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn295-1"><a href="#fn-fn295">295</a></sup> This passage is consistent with the two
commentarial passages cited above.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some commentarial and sub-commentarial passages emphasize
that the term <em>bhāvanā</em> in the context of the four kinds of development
does not refer to spiritual practice currently engaged in – to practice
applied in order to reach the goal – but rather to the practice of
arahants which is completed or has already reached the goal. For
example: ’It is development by the fact of having been developed.’<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn296-1"><a href="#fn-fn296">296</a></sup></p>

<p>{913} The expression ’learned noble disciple’ (<em>sutavant</em> or <em>sutavā
ariyasāvaka</em>) is always paired with the expression ’untaught ordinary
person’ (<em>assutavā puthujjana</em>), which is explained as: <em>An untaught
ordinary person, who has not seen the noble ones and is unskilled and
undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has not seen true men, and is
unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma</em>. The commentaries explain
’untaught ordinary person’ as a ’blind’ or ’foolish’ person
(<em>andha-puthujjana</em> or <em>andhabāla-puthujjana</em>). The expression ’has not
seen the noble ones’ means that a person has not regularly sought out
and visited the noble ones, and even if he has met them he does not know
how to derive benefit from this meeting. ’Seen’ here means seeing with
wisdom, not merely seeing with the physical eye.</p>
<p>In the Pali Canon the term ’noble Dhamma’ (<em>ariya-dhamma</em>) can refer to
the ten wholesome courses of action (<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn297-1"><a href="#fn-fn297">297</a></sup> to the
ten qualities of an adept (<em>asekha-dhamma</em>; also known as the ten right
states – <em>sammatta</em>: the Eightfold Path plus right knowledge –
<em>sammā-ñāṇa –</em> and right liberation – <em>sammā-vimutti</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn298-1"><a href="#fn-fn298">298</a></sup> or
simply to the five precepts.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn299-1"><a href="#fn-fn299">299</a></sup> The commentaries explaining these
canonical references give a broad definition to <em>ariya-dhamma</em>, as
meaning ’various spiritual qualities’, for example the Foundations of
Mindfulness (<em>satipaṭṭhāna</em>).</p>
<p>Regarding the term <em>ariya</em> (or <em>ariya-puggala</em>), these commentaries say
that it usually refers to the Buddha, Pacceka-Buddhas, and Buddhist
disciples, but where <em>ariya</em> is paired with <em>sappurisa</em> (’true men’) it
refers solely to the Buddha, while <em>sappurisa</em> (or <em>sappurisa-jana</em>)
refers to Pacceka-Buddhas and Buddhist disciples.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn300-1"><a href="#fn-fn300">300</a></sup></p>

<p>There are several occasions when the Buddha discussed the incentives for
people to offer gifts:</p>

<li>
<p>To give for gain; to give out of attachment; to give believing one
will receive an identical gift in return after death;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to give out of the belief that giving is good;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to give out of the consideration that one’s ancestors gave gifts
and one should not break this family tradition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to give thinking: ’I can provide for myself but these people are
unable to provide for themselves; when I can provide for myself,
it is unsuitable to not give to those who cannot provide for
themselves’;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to give with the thought: ’This gift of mine is like the great
sacrifices of the ascetics from the past’; one seeks prestige;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to give thinking that joy and delight will arise as a consequence;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to give in order to equip the mind or to improve the quality of
the mind; one believes that giving is a way to develop the mind,
that giving softens the heart of both the donor and recipient,
that giving is a form of renunciation, and that giving fosters
lovingkindness and compassion; one gives with the thought: ’May
those who suffer find happiness through this gift’; technically
speaking, this last form of giving is a support for tranquillity
and insight.<sup class="footnote-reference" id="fr-fn301-1"><a href="#fn-fn301">301</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>A. IV. 59-63.</em></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>to give out of fear;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to give as repayment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to give hoping the recipient will return the favour; to wish for a
reward;</p>

<li>
<p>to give out of the belief that giving is good;</p>

<li>
<p>to give thinking: ’I can provide for myself but these people are

<li>
<p>to give with the thought that by giving one’s fame will spread;</p>

<p>The sutta of the first group finishes with a description of the states
of existence where donors with these various motivations will be reborn,
but this description accords with the natural consequences of these
actions. The states of rebirth are not necessarily connected to the
wishes of the donor. {914}</p>

<p>Beware of interpreting the term <em>paṭikkūla</em> (’repulsive’) in too
narrow a sense, as ’dirty’ or ’disgusting’. Examples in the
scriptures of perceiving the non-repulsive in the repulsive include
looking at someone who is physically unattractive with
lovingkindness, or looking at an unpleasant material object from the
perspective of its constituent elements, thus seeing it as meritable
or pleasing on the eye. Similarly, looking at a person or an object
that is generally considered to be beautiful from the perspective of
impermanence, or by analyzing his/her/its component elements, is an
example of perceiving the repulsive in the non-repulsive. See

<p>Some secondary and later texts divide liberation into three
kinds and expand them into categories, according to discernment into
each of the three universal characteristics (<em>tilakkhaṇa</em>), and
linked to the dominant faculties. These three liberations are
<em>suññata-vimokkha</em>, <em>animitta-vimokkha</em> and <em>appaṇihita-vimokkha</em>.

contains the same self-examination and declaration, but only
mentions the five fearful retributions and the four factors of
stream-entry – there is no mention of the noble method. A. III.

supreme mental abidings for dwelling in happiness in the present’.
There are many references to stream-enterers specifically linked to
an understanding of Dependent Origination (the ’noble method’),
e.g.: S. II. 43, 59, 80 (they are usually referred to here as
’perfected in view’ – <em>diṭṭhi-sampanna</em>). Stream-enterers are
considered to be ’true knowers of the world’ (S. II. 80; A. IV. 238;
Dh. verse 44). At S. II. 59, stream-enterers are said to possess two
forms of knowledge: ’truth-knowledge’ (<em>dhamma-ñāṇa</em>) and
’conformity knowledge’ (<em>anvaya-ñāṇa</em>), which are both related to
Dependent Origination. <a href="#fr-fn208-1">↩</a></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of beginning stages of practice, the Buddha stated that ’merit
is a name for happiness’ (merit = <em>puñña</em>; ’goodness’, ’performing
wholesome deeds’).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<div class="note">

<blockquote>
<p>Chapter 23 is new to the Thai edition of <em>Buddhadhamma</em>. Happiness is
a subject that is of universal interest, and I have wished for a long
time to supplement the original chapter in <em>Buddhadhamma</em> on happiness
which is rather complex and full of technical references. On February
24, 2010, I was invited to speak on the occasion of the 80th birthday
of Hon. Professor Dr. Sakorn Dhanamitta (advisor to the Educational
Project for Developing Health). The content of this talk was published
in December of that year, under the title of ’All Aspects of
Happiness’, and this chapter is a précis of that book. Note that many
of the topics in this chapter have been touched upon in some respects
in the original chapter on happiness and in the chapter on desire and
motivation (see chapter 10).</p>
<p>[Trans.: this chapter on happiness in the English edition of
<em>Buddhadhamma</em> combines the two chapters on happiness from the Thai
edition. Although this has been a challenge (chap. 22 is presented in
a formal written style, whereas chap. 23 is a transcript from a talk)
I have attempted to knit these two chapters together into an
integrated whole.]</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In terms of meditation, happiness is an important factor giving rise to
concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), as confirmed by the Buddha: <em>A happy mind
becomes well-established [in concentration]</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> In the scriptures,
happiness is described as the ’proximate cause’ (<em>padaṭṭhāna</em>) for
concentration. When the mind is highly concentrated and one reaches the
state of jhāna, happiness (<em>sukha</em>) is one of the jhāna factors
(<em>jhānaṅga</em>), present up to the third jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> Although happiness is
technically not a factor of the concentrative attainments
(<em>jhāna-samāpatti</em>) higher than the third jhāna, these states are
nonetheless considered to be a more refined form of happiness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the highest goal of Buddhism – Nibbāna – is described as a
form of happiness, the supreme form of happiness (<em>parama-sukha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>An important synonym for Nibbāna is <em>nirodha</em> (’cessation’), which is
endowed with three key attributes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The cessation of ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>): this is equivalent to the
arising of supreme knowledge and vision (<em>ñāṇa-dassana</em>), to a
realization of the truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cessation of mental defilement (<em>kilesa</em>): the elimination of
mental impurities; the end of any root factors in the mind causing
distress for oneself or others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cessation of suffering (<em>dukkha</em>): the end of suffering; the
attainment of supreme happiness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although this third attribute – the end of suffering – was described
to some extent in the chapter on an arahants’s mental self-mastery
(<em>bhāvita-citta</em>), there are several more aspects to this attribute that
need to be considered.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, this highest goal of Buddhism, of awakening (<em>bodhi</em>) or
supreme happiness, is to be reached by way of happiness or through a
practice comprised of happiness. It is not to be reached by way of
suffering or through affliction and torment.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> {1024}</p>
<p>In relation to Dhamma practice, the scriptures describe various kinds of
happiness, and at the same time they describe both the advantages and
the faults of each kind. They also compare each kind of happiness with
other kinds, to point out how one is superior to another. This
description of the various kinds of happiness and their comparison to
each other is a way of urging people to progress in spiritual practice
and to develop superior kinds of happiness. Every person has the
potential to progress in these various stages of happiness until he or
she reaches supreme happiness.</p>
<p>This comparison of various kinds of happiness indicates that although
lower levels of happiness may have favourable aspects, they are still
imperfect. They still have both advantages (<em>assāda</em>) and disadvantages
(<em>ādīnava</em>). In order to gain a clear understanding and to progress in
Dhamma practice, it is essential to recognize these advantages and
disadvantages. {1070}</p>
<p>In this context, there is a third factor: one must also have a way out
(<em>nissaraṇa</em>), an escape, where one is freed from both the advantages
and disadvantages. In short, one reaches a superior or more complete
state of happiness.</p>
<p>One should apply these three principles while focusing on a specific
level of happiness, by examining it and determining its pros and cons.
If the happiness is still endowed with disadvantages, one then asks
whether there is a way out, a way to pass beyond this state of
incompleteness, a way to reach freedom and security. When one encounters
such a way out (<em>nissaraṇa</em>), spiritual practice can progress.</p>
<p>In sum, Buddhism acknowledges many different levels of happiness and
teaches that happiness needs to be cultivated. One can define the
entirety of Buddhist practice as this cultivation of happiness. Buddhism
is a system of developing happiness, and the development of happiness is
given great emphasis in Buddhism.</p>
<h3 id="happiness-is-reached-by-happiness"><a class="header" href="#happiness-is-reached-by-happiness">Happiness Is Reached by Happiness</a></h3>
<p>It is often overlooked that Buddhism is a religion of happiness. If one
encounters such statements as ’life is suffering’ or ’all is suffering’,
one may think that Buddhism is permeated by suffering. When people see
that the Four Noble Truths begin with <em>dukkha</em> (’suffering’), or they
encounter the Buddha’s words in relation to the Four Noble Truths, ’Both
in the past and in the present, I teach only suffering and the end of
suffering,’ some people may be convinced that Buddhism is a religion
pervaded by suffering.</p>
<p>People need to be constantly reminded that the Buddha accompanied the
teaching of the Four Noble Truths with the four ’duties’ (<em>kicca</em>). If
one performs these duties incorrectly, then one trips up from the very
start; one will not be able to reach the heart of Buddhism. Especially
in regard to the first noble truth, one needs to be as accurate as
possible. If it helps, one can memorize the Pali phrase: <em>Dukkhaṃ
ariyasaccaṃ pariññeyyaṃ</em> (’the noble truth of suffering should be
thoroughly understood’).</p>
<p>Our responsibility in the face of suffering is comprehensive
understanding; suffering is to be thoroughly understood. Suffering is a
matter to be taken up and addressed by wisdom; it is not something to be
accumulated in order to torment the heart. If one experiences suffering,
use wisdom to deal with it and bring it to an end. This is the beginning
of the correct path of practice.</p>
<p>One can look at the life of the Buddha. Before he was awakened, he
practised severe austerities and extreme asceticism, which was the
custom of renunciants at that time. When he realized that this is a
wrong form of practice, he abandoned these austerities and turned to the
’middle way of practice’ (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>), until he reached
awakening. This is a brief summary of events. A close examination of
this account from the Tipiṭaka provides a clearer understanding of
Buddhism on the whole.</p>
<p>In the Bodhirājakumāra Sutta, the Buddha recounts how before his
enlightenment he had this thought: ’Happiness cannot be reached by way
of happiness; it can only be reached by way of pain.’ It was for this
reason that he went forth into the renunciant way of life.</p>
<p>He then went to live with two meditation masters at their hermitages.
Afterwards he undertook extreme ascetic practices with intensity and
ardour, experiencing extreme physical pain, but all in vain. He realized
that it is not possible to reach the supreme good by way of
self-mortification. Note here his words: ’The way to awakening must be
otherwise.’ {1071} He remembered an event from his childhood, when he
was sitting quietly alone in the shade of a jambolan tree and had
attained the first jhāna, distinguished by bliss and joy. He had the
insight that this is the path, as confirmed by the words he spoke to
himself: ’Here, indeed, is the path to awakening.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>When he was clear in his mind about this issue he asked himself whether
he is afraid of this happiness free from sensual pleasure and free from
unwholesome states. This was a way of verifying whether this happiness
contains any danger. He answered with confidence that he was without
fear. He consequently abandoned the extreme ascetic practices, followed
the path of happiness, which is represented by the term ’middle way’
(<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>), and finally reached awakening.</p>
<p>An important distinction is that many of the religious traditions in
India at that time claimed that ’happiness cannot be reached by way of
happiness; it can only be reached by way of pain.’ Adherents of these
traditions thus undertook extreme ascetic practices (<em>tapa</em>). Buddhism,
however, teaches that ’happiness can be reached by way of happiness’,
and thus encourages practitioners to abandon extreme ascetic practices,
which are classified as ’self-mortification’ (<em>atta-kilamathānuyoga</em>)
and considered a waste of time.</p>
<p>The most basic form of happiness is derived by coming into contact with
external objects, and is dependent on material things, and is thus
referred to as ’sense pleasure’ (<em>kāma-sukha</em>). When one has developed
and accessed a higher form of happiness, this superior happiness exists
in tandem with sense pleasure. Alternatively, one may choose to abandon
sense pleasure altogether and only abide in a more refined kind of
happiness.</p>
<p>These superior forms of happiness prevent the dangers of a dependence on
material things; indeed, they provide a greater degree of independence.
One is able to experience happiness without needing to consume things.
Note the phrase by the Buddha above: ’Happiness free from sensual
pleasure and free from unwholesome states.’ One progresses in unison
with wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>).</p>
<p>A vital factor in this correct practice for promoting independence is
wisdom. With wisdom, even if the refined forms of happiness are
sustained over a long period of time, they do not overwhelm the mind;
one is not intoxicated; one does not forget oneself. True happiness goes
hand in hand with freedom, and conversely true freedom is endowed with
happiness.</p>
<p>One reason why the birth of Buddhism was so revolutionary, allegedly
causing an earthquake and excitement all the way up to the highest
Brahma realms, is because it introduced this new perspective and way of
life, that happiness can be reached by happiness.</p>
<p>The goal of Buddhism – supreme happiness (<em>parama-sukha</em>) – is
accompanied by wisdom, which frees the mind through understanding. This
is genuine, independent, and secure happiness; it need not be searched
for and it is free from a reliance on external things; it remains
constant; wherever one is, one is bright, joyous, and happy. All of us
who are aware of this principle of supreme happiness have the
opportunity to develop ourselves in order to realize it. {1072}</p>

<h3 id="what-is-happiness"><a class="header" href="#what-is-happiness">What is Happiness?</a></h3>
<p>In order to develop happiness it is important to know the meaning and
significance of happiness. In brief, happiness is the fulfilment of
one’s desires and needs, or simply a sense of fulfilment and
satisfaction. Note that this definition is not all-encompassing, but it
covers a broad and basic range of meaning. It is a crucial definition
because it comprises the happiness that most people are confined to;
most people are not aware of a happiness greater than this.</p>
<p>Wishing to take a shower and having taken a shower, one is happy.
Wishing to eat and having eaten, one is happy. A child who wants to play
and has finished playing is happy. This is a fulfilment of one’s desire,
a meeting of one’s needs.</p>
<p>As a matter of linguistics, it is important here to recognize that some
branches of modern academic study make a distinction between ’desire’
and ’needs’, and give these terms different definitions. In this context
I am using these two terms interchangeably, with identical meanings.
Here the focus is more on ’desire’ than on ’need’ (i.e. a requirement).</p>
<p>By defining happiness as the fulfilment of desires, it is also important
to understand the nature of desire. The subject of desire is vast. Note
here the Buddha’s principal tenet: ’All things are rooted in desire’
(<em>chanda-mūlakā sabbe dhammā</em>). This means that all things human beings
are engaged with are based on desire, have their origin in desire.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We must clearly understand the nature of desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that happiness is the fulfilment of desire, it stands to
reason that the development of happiness requires a development of
desire. Otherwise, the development of happiness is unsuccessful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, desire must be cultivated. {1073}</p>
<p>Ambiguity and confusion about the nature of desire prevents people from
seeing things clearly, from making headway, and from solving problems.
This is true for all human activities, including formal study, moral
conduct, and spiritual practice. If one fails to understand desire, one
will not reach the essence of the matter at hand.</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-and-importance-of-desire"><a class="header" href="#the-nature-and-importance-of-desire">The Nature and Importance of Desire</a></h3>
<p>The technical terms for desire are rather complex. The relevant term in
the above quote by the Buddha is <em>chanda</em>, which can be translated here
as ’desire’, ’wanting’, or ’wish’.</p>
<p>The term <em>chanda</em> is essentially neutral: it can be used in a positive
or negative sense; it can be wholesome or unwholesome. For example,
there are terms such as ’sense desire’ (<em>kāma-chanda</em>), ’desire for
renunciation’ (<em>nekkhamma-chanda</em>), ’desire to consume’
(<em>paribhoga-chanda</em>), ’desire for the Dhamma’ (<em>dhamma-chanda</em>), etc.</p>
<p>In the scriptures the term <em>chanda</em> is then divided into two kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Desire as craving (<em>taṇhā-chanda</em>): the desire to obtain, to seize,
to become, to possess, or to destroy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Desire as the wish to act (<em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em>): the desire to
act, the wish to engage, the wish to create, the desire to improve,
the desire to train, the desire to study, the desire to practise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The former is negative and unwholesome (<em>akusala-chanda</em>); the latter is
positive and wholesome (<em>kusala-chanda</em>). This is easy to understand,
although these terms are rather long and unwieldy.</p>
<p>Here is where things get complex. When teaching the Dhamma or when
communicating in everyday circumstances, it was convenient to use short,
concise terms. The result is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When referring to negative, unwholesome desire the single term
<em>taṇhā</em> is used (it is not necessary to say <em>taṇhā-chanda</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When referring to positive, wholesome desire the single term
<em>chanda</em> is used (it is not necessary to say <em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em>,
<em>kusala-chanda</em> – ’wholesome desire’, <em>dhamma-chanda</em>,
<em>sabhāva-chanda</em> – ’desire for truth’, etc.).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a simple, easy-to-understand distinction. The word <em>taṇhā</em>
implies a negative form of desire; the word <em>chanda</em> implies a positive
form of desire. If this distinction is not clearly understood, things
get very confusing. For example one may wonder, by assuming that
<em>chanda</em> is a positive term, why <em>kāma-chanda</em> (’sense desire’) is
described as negative. {1074}</p>
<p>The commentators selected the neutral word <em>patthanā</em> (’wish’, ’desire’)
to combine with the two terms mentioned above, thus creating a similar
distinction:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Desire as craving (<em>taṇhā-patthanā</em>): the wish to obtain; the wish
to consume.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Desire as wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda-patthanā</em>): wholesome
desire; the wish to do good.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Many people, especially Buddhists, encounter the word ’desire’ and
immediately label it as bad or incorrect. They then go on to encourage
others to not have desires, which they see as dangerous and potentially
destructive, both for an individual’s spiritual development and for
society.</p>
<p>Others go to an opposite extreme and promote desire, encouraging people
to acquire things and to increase wealth. Some even advocate greed,
urging people to be rich, famous, and influential. They claim this
hunger for things is required for society to develop. This is not true
development, however; rather it leads eventually to conflict and
destruction. The best people can achieve by such efforts is to reach an
unstable form of development, both politically and economically.</p>
<p>These people represent two extremes, but they share the common factor of
a lack of understanding. They do not understand the nature of desire and
do not deal with it correctly. Therefore, it is essential to understand
and distinguish between different kinds of desire. This will lead to
greater clarity.</p>
<p>Having provided a rough outline of the distinction between the two kinds
of desire, let us now focus on some of their essential characteristics:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Craving (<em>taṇhā</em>): desire catering to selfish needs, e.g.: a wish to
acquire something for oneself; the search for self-gratification;
the wish to personally consume, obtain, become, or avoid something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>): desire focusing on the inherent
nature of the object involved; a search for the wellness, virtue,
and completeness of an object.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Take, for instance, the natural surroundings of a monastery. People
enter the forested area of a monastery and see squirrels bounding in the
trees. Some people will rejoice in the charm and nimbleness of the
squirrels. They may think: ’What a delightful sight. May these squirrels
be healthy and strong. May this beautiful and refreshing place prosper.’
In this way they desire for the completeness of the thing in question.
They possess a wholesome desire.</p>
<p>Other people will see the same squirrels and think: ’These squirrels are
plump and meaty. If only I could catch one and cook it for my evening
soup.’ Here, the desire is for self-gratification; it is an unwholesome
form of desire, based on craving.</p>
<p>Another example is the consideration by certain students who have
finished their secondary eduction to go on and study medicine. Some
students want to be doctors in order to get rich and to gain honour and
prestige. This is a selfish, unwholesome form of desire. {1075} Other
students wish to study medicine because they want others to be free from
illness, to be healthy, to be free from affliction, to live safely and
at ease. This desire aims for the completeness of the conditions at hand
– in this case the health of the nation’s people – which is the
express purpose of the medical profession. This is a wholesome desire.</p>
<p>When people’s needs and desires are fulfilled they experience happiness.
For this reason, happiness among people varies according to their
desires. When those who wish for the squirrels to be well and healthy
see them bounding through the trees, their desire is fulfilled and they
will immediately experience happiness. Those who wish to eat the
squirrels for the sake of their palates must hunt the squirrels, kill
them, and cook them in order to prepare them as a meal; only then will
their desire be satisfied and will they experience happiness.</p>
<p>From a wider perspective, those people with wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>)
like to create the causes for prosperity, while those full of craving
simply wait to enjoy the fruits of prosperity. Those with wholesome
desire are creators; those with craving are consumers. The former
experience happiness in creating; the latter experience happiness in
consuming.</p>
<p>In a society with people of such different inclinations, it is too much
to expect that the current of craving will dry up on its own or that the
way of wholesome desire will prevail. The best one can do is to balance
these two forces, to prevent the floods of craving from washing people
into the abyss, and to support the fulfilment of wholesome desire. As
long as there are people dedicated to fulfilling wholesome desire, human
society can progress. Moreover, supporting the spiritual development of
people simultaneously increases the happiness for all.</p>
<h3 id="delight-and-happiness"><a class="header" href="#delight-and-happiness">Delight and Happiness</a></h3>
<p>It was mentioned above that happiness is the fulfilment of needs, the
satisfaction of desires. Another way of describing this fulfilment and
satisfaction is to say that desires have been stilled, similar to
slaking thirst or alleviating hunger. When thirst or hunger is allayed,
one experiences happiness. According to this definition, happiness is
the abating of desire; happiness is peace.</p>
<p>In this process, before the mind reaches that peace constituting
happiness, one may experience various forms of delight and pleasure. In
particular, one may experience <em>pīti</em> (’delight’, ’rapture’, ’bliss’),
which in Pali is often paired with happiness as <em>pīti-sukha</em>. Discerning
these various stages of delight and fulfilment provides a clearer
understanding of how happiness is equal to peace. Moreover, one realizes
the nature and value of such peace. {1076}</p>
<p>In regard to these two aforementioned terms, the pleasure derived from
obtaining a desired object is considered to be <em>pīti</em>, while the actual
enjoyment of experiencing that object is <em>sukha</em>. For example, a person
who is travelling through a desert, who is parched and exhausted, will
experience rapture when he sees water or hears from another that water
is nearby. When he reaches the shade of the oasis, and drinks from and
bathes in the pool, he experiences happiness.</p>
<p>The commentaries provide an example for clarification.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> A man has
travelled a long distance through a barren wilderness. He is soaked in
sweat, famished and thirsty. At one point he meets someone travelling
the other way and asks whether there is any drinking water ahead. He is
told that not far ahead is a large pond with a wooded grove. When he
hears this news he is exceedingly glad and elated.</p>
<p>When he walks further and sees the lotus petals, leaves, and stalks
scattered on the path he is even more delighted. He walks on and sees
people with wet clothes and wet hair, and hears the cry of forest
chickens and peacocks. And as he approaches the pond and sees the lush
woodland grove and the lotuses growing in the clear, clean water he
grows increasingly exultant.</p>
<p>Finally he steps into the water, providing a great sense of refreshment.
The exhilaration he felt earlier is replaced by calm. He bathes and
drinks to his heart’s content, dispelling all anxiety, and he eats the
roots and young leaves of the lotuses until he is full. He then climbs
onto the bank and lies down in the cool shade of the trees, caressed by
a gentle breeze, and says to himself: ’Ah, such happiness.’</p>
<p>According to this example one can see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The delight and elation the man experiences from the moment he hears
about the pond and wooded grove until he sees it with his own eyes
constitutes <em>pīti</em>, which is a preliminary joy and pleasure in the
object about to be experienced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His bathing in the water, slaking his thirst, satisfying his hunger,
and resting in the shade of the trees constitute <em>sukha</em>: actually
experiencing the desired object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Pīti</em> has the characteristics of elation, euphoria, exuberance,
exultation, radiance, and suffusion, which are all extremely positive
qualities. Yet however positive this delight and rapture may be, it is
not yet complete; it has not yet reached its goal. In the end it must
conclude and culminate in happiness, which is precisely inner peace. If
this delight is not yet peaceful it is not yet complete; it reaches
completion and perfection at peace, which is referred to as ’happiness’
(<em>sukha</em>).</p>
<p>In fact, a detailed and thorough analysis reveals that there is another
important state of mind existing between <em>pīti</em> and <em>sukha</em>. Above, we
looked only at the gratification of desire, which is an aspect of
acquisition. But a closer analysis also requires a look at the actual
nature of desire.</p>
<p>Desire possesses the attributes of compulsion and disturbance. If it
becomes intense it manifests as anxiety, stress, restlessness, and even
turmoil. Despite the heightening of delight (<em>pīti</em>), as one reaches the
stage of fulfilment of desire, the anxiety, stress, and restlessness,
which are attributes of desire and have an impact on the body and mind,
ease and subside. Agitation is reduced; one becomes even and calm. This
state is referred to as ’tranquillity’ (<em>passaddhi</em>). {1077}</p>
<p>Tranquillity (<em>passaddhi</em>) is the direct antecedent to happiness
(<em>sukha</em>). Therefore, when making a more detailed distinction, the
scriptures describe the ordered progression as: <em>pīti</em> → <em>passaddhi</em> →
<em>sukha</em>.</p>
<p>Desire based on craving is full of agitation, anxiety, and stress,
because it rests on a foundation of delusion and is fed by the
attachment to a sense of self. Desire based on wholesome enthusiasm,
however, is naturally accompanied by wisdom, which prevents or corrects
these mental afflictions.</p>
<p>Note that besides a stilling of desire by way of gratification, there is
also a stilling of desire by way of non-gratification, which is an
opposite form of intentional action.</p>
<p>One must be careful though. If one tries to still desire by obstructing,
resisting, suppressing, or controlling it, the repercussions are even
more serious than when seeking gratification. The agitation and turmoil
increases and one may vent one’s frustration or explode, causing extra
suffering to oneself and endangering others. This then leads to
retaliation and reprisals. This inner suppression is merely a form of
coercion; it is not true peace.</p>
<p>At the beginning of spiritual practice, the very awareness of training
helps in part to deal with desire. Although, to some degree, one may be
acting against one’s will and choosing a path of non-gratification, the
benefits of training include a feeling of self-development and a joy in
having tested one’s strength and resolve.</p>
<p>There are additional tools for working with desire:</p>
<p>First, to empower wholesome mental qualities. One ensures that wholesome
desire (<em>chanda</em>), which longs for knowledge, is stronger than craving
(<em>taṇhā</em>), which longs for indulgence. Such wholesome desire, for
instance, prevents one from skipping work in order to go off drinking
with one’s friends.</p>
<p>Second, negative qualities are replaced by positive qualities. For
example, Paul covets John’s money and wants to steal it, but he
considers how difficult it was for John to acquire this money. John has
enough problems; why create more for him? This thought gives rise to
compassion, and the craving dries up and is stilled.</p>
<p>In respect to wisdom, take for example a person who sees gold for sale
at an extremely cheap price. His eyes widen and he desires this gold,
but once he discovers that the gold is fake his desire vanishes
instantly. This recognition, however, is only a basic or counterfeit
form of wisdom; it deals only with immediate problems.</p>
<p>Disciples endowed with genuine wisdom discern that gold, silver, jewels,
indeed all material wealth, does not make up the true purpose of life.
Material wealth does not truly belong to anyone; it is unable to provide
true happiness or distinction to one’s life; both the wealth itself and
all living beings are subject to the laws of nature: of impermanence,
<em>dukkha</em>, and nonself. To benefit from material things one must gain
insight into their true nature, so that they do not create harm. When
one has opened oneself up to true freedom and happiness, these things
can be renounced without hesitation. Such wisdom prevents craving from
gaining any footing and leads to true peace.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether one stills desire by way of gratification or one
abstains from gratifying unhealthy desires by empowering wholesome
qualities and applying wisdom, the resulting stillness and peace
(<em>santi</em>) itself constitutes happiness. Happiness is peace.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> {1078}</p>
<h3 id="dual-pathways-to-happiness"><a class="header" href="#dual-pathways-to-happiness">Dual Pathways to Happiness</a></h3>
<p>Most people are endowed with a ’starting capital’ of both craving and
wholesome enthusiasm. Those leaders in society or those who act as
mentors (<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>; ’virtuous friends’) should understand this fact
and help others to both promote wholesome desire and to regulate or
subdue craving. At the very least, people should prevent the
undercurrent of craving from becoming an overwhelming force.</p>
<p>In regard to basic wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>), most people wish for
their environment to be well-ordered, tidy and clean. When they
encounter a beautiful natural setting they rejoice. They want their
surroundings to be in a state of completeness; they want people,
animals, trees, and plants to be healthy and vibrant. In the same vein,
people want their own bodies to be healthy, strong, and clean, and to
exist in a state of completeness. (These are useful examples for
distinguishing between <em>chanda</em> and <em>taṇhā</em>).</p>
<p>At the same time most people wish to gratify their desires by way of
contact with appealing and agreeable visual forms, fragrances, sounds,
tastes, and tactile objects. These are collectively referred to as
’material objects’ (<em>āmisa</em>) or ’sense objects’ (<em>kāma</em>). Because these
sense objects rely on a coarse form of contact and often involve strong
stimulation, they can be very seductive. Developing a thorough
understanding so as not to be led astray by these enticements requires
repeated emphasis.</p>
<p>Let us compare these two kinds of desire in more depth:</p>
<p>As mentioned above, wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>) begins with a
pleasure and contentment in seeing things exist in a state of wellbeing
and completeness. If the object or person in question is not yet in a
state of completeness, or is in a state of only partial completeness,
one wishes to act in order to fulfil this completeness. It is at this
stage of wanting to act that one reaches the true essence of <em>chanda</em>,
which is referred to as ’desire as the wish to act’
(<em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em>).</p>
<p>The unwholesome form of desire – craving, on the other hand, manifests
as a lust for the five sense objects in order to achieve gratification
by way of consuming things. Craving is the desire for consumption. This
is a desire to obtain and to acquire solely for one’s own benefit. Here
is where a crucial distinction between these two kinds of desire is
evident.</p>
<p>When craving arises, it is by definition accompanied by a presumed
’owner’, ’desirer’, ’claimant’, or ’consumer’, i.e. by someone who
acquires, seizes, and consumes, who wants to get things for the sake of
this so-called ’owner’ or ’consumer’. This is the birth of a sense of
self. {1079}</p>
<p>Wholesome enthusiasm functions differently; it is accompanied by a
delight and satisfaction in witnessing the goodness and completeness of
an object. This delight arises without needing to do anything. If the
object is not yet in a state of completeness there is a desire for it to
reach this state. This desire for completeness generates another level
of desire, which is the wish to act to bring about completeness.</p>
<p>In the case that one does not know how to bring about such completeness,
the natural causal process advocates how to respond. The desire for
completeness and the inquiry into how to bring this about leads to a
desire for knowledge, a yearning to understand.</p>
<p>The above explanations indicate the breadth of meaning of the term
<em>chanda</em>. First, there is a delight in the goodness, beauty, and
completeness of an object or person. Second, there is a wish for this
thing or person to remain healthy, complete, or happy. Third, in the
case that this thing or person has not yet reached such a state of
completion, there is a wish to act in order to help bring about this
completion. And fourth, there is a desire to gain the necessary
knowledge required to help bring about completion.</p>
<p>The first distinction here is that wholesome enthusiasm wishes for
something to exist in a natural state of fulfilment and completion. When
one encounters something or someone in this state of completion one
immediately experiences happiness and satisfaction, for instance when
one delights in the beauty of nature. This differs from craving, which
must wait for gratification until an object can be consumed.</p>
<p>Another essential distinction is that throughout the process of
wholesome enthusiasm there is desire without the birth of ’one who
desires’ or the birth of an agent who must act. This differs from the
process of craving, which requires a sense of self: of a consumer, an
owner, a controller, etc. If while engaging with something by way of
wholesome enthusiasm a fixed sense of identity arises, this indicates
that defilements associated with self-view have infiltrated the mind. A
subtle defilement that tends to arise in this context is ’conceit’
(<em>māna</em>; the wish for self-importance).</p>
<p>The essence of <em>chanda</em> is a desire to act. For this reason this term is
defined as <em>kattukamyatā-chanda</em>: desire as a wish to act. A frequent
definition of <em>chanda</em> is <em>chandoti kattukamyatā-chando</em>: ’<em>chanda</em> is
the aspiration expressed as a desire to act (in order for something to
reach a state of virtue or completion)’. This point needs to be
reiterated because it is the starting point of human spiritual
development.</p>
<p>If we are endowed with wholesome enthusiasm, we will rejoice and feel at
ease when we see that our house or monastery is clean and tidy. If it is
dirty or messy, we will want to clean it. We will grab a broom and sweep
the floor or the grounds. If we do not know how to sweep, we will want
to learn and will study the best methods of sweeping. We will become
experts at sweeping and experience joy while sweeping. This is an
example of spiritual training and of how wholesome enthusiasm is the
starting point of spiritual development.</p>
<p>With craving, however, this process of training does not begin. When
craving arises, one wishes to obtain something in order to consume it.
With consumption, the process ends; one has no wish to improve oneself.
{1080}</p>
<h3 id="wholesome-desire-in-relation-to-others"><a class="header" href="#wholesome-desire-in-relation-to-others">Wholesome Desire in Relation to Others</a></h3>
<p>So far the discussion on desire has focused on people’s work and
activities, as well as touching upon the relationship to one’s
environment. For this discussion to be complete, however, one must also
look at wholesome desire in relation to other human beings.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) is the wish for all
things to exist in a state of goodness and completion. This desire
extends also to all sentient beings. This well-wishing towards all
beings, beginning with one’s human companions, is the desire for others
to be well, to flourish, to be healthy and strong, and to experience joy
and happiness.</p>
<p>Interaction with other human beings is a vital part of people’s lives.
Likewise, wholesome desire in relation to other humans beings, and
indeed, to all beings, holds a special significance in people’s lives.</p>
<p>This well-wishing, or desire for goodness, in relation to other people
and other living creatures, has exceptional attributes, distinct from
the desire for inanimate things to reach a state of wellness and
completion. For this reason, there are several terms used to represent
<em>chanda</em> in this context, depending on specific circumstances. Instead
of using the term <em>chanda</em> to designate wholesome desire vis-à-vis other
human beings, the following four terms are used:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Mettā</em> (’lovingkindness’): under normal circumstances, if one has
wholesome desire – a sense of well-wishing – towards other people,
one wants them to have a bright complexion, be physically healthy
and experience happiness. This is a basic, initial form of
well-wishing. It is a desire focusing on another person or living
creature; it is not tied up with personal concerns. {1096}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Karuṇā</em> (’compassion’): if one encounters another person (or living
creature) who is unhealthy, debilitated, anguished, or troubled, or
who has fallen on bad times, one wishes for him or her to be free
from such suffering, destitution, misery, or illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Muditā</em> (’appreciative joy’): if another person prospers, a child
grows up to blossom and thrive, someone is healthy, physically
beautiful and attractive, someone reaches some form of true success,
etc., one rejoices in his or her accomplishments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Upekkhā</em> (’equanimity’): In some circumstances, another person is
able to take self-responsibility, or else it is suitable and
appropriate for him or her to take such responsibility. In such
cases, one should allow him or her to remain independent, without
interference. For example, two parents may be watching their toddler
learn how to walk. Wishing for the child to grow and succeed, they
watch from a distance without intruding. They do not get caught up
with worry and constantly cradle the child. The desire here for a
state of wellness is a desire for people’s success, goodness, and
rectitude. One wishes for them to abide in uprightness, correctness,
and safety, for them to exist in truth and righteousness. To enable
this, one refrains in these circumstances from interfering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) is the catalyst for these four mind states.
In other words, wholesome desire expresses itself in four different
contexts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A sense of well-wishing when people abide in a normal state of
happiness (= <em>mettā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sense of well-wishing when people fall on hard times; a wish for
them to be released from suffering and to arrive at a state of
wellbeing (= <em>karuṇā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sense of well-wishing when people reach success and
accomplishment; a wish for them to achieve ever greater prosperity
(= <em>muditā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sense of well-wishing when people have the opportunity to exercise
self-responsibility; a wish for them to abide in integrity,
uprightness, security, and righteousness (= <em>upekkhā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most people only consider the first three kinds of well-wishing, but
this is insufficient, because these three factors are still confined to
the domain of ’feeling’. Although these feelings, sentiments, or
emotions are exalted and highly cultivated, they are not yet complete.
Only the fourth factor brings completion.</p>
<p>In brief, if people only possess wholesome sentiments, no matter how
elevated or sublime these may be, this is inadequate. These sentiments
fulfil personal attributes, but they are not yet linked with truth –
with Dhamma. Although these people are ’good’, they may not yet be
’correct’. To realize the truth, to reach true correctness, to dispel
suffering, and to realize perfect happiness, one must also possess
knowledge.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, completing the cultivation of the mind (<em>citta</em>)
is insufficient. Factors of the mind, or the heart, cannot by themselves
bring about liberation. One must complete the cultivation of wisdom
(<em>paññā</em>), which is the decisive factor for liberation and mental
perfection. The first three forms of well-wishing are confined to
factors of the mind. The fourth factor involves wisdom, which prompts
true application of the mind and leads to liberation. {1097}</p>
<p>In sum, although people may possess positive emotions, they need wisdom
to regulate, refine, and elevate these emotions.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> The fourth factor
of equanimity constitutes this link with wisdom.</p>
<p>If people lack wisdom, they are unable to solve life’s problems. Even if
they are possessed with virtues and wholesome sentiments, they may apply
these incorrectly and perform unskilful actions.</p>
<p>Say a thief steals $2,000. From one perspective, he has reached
success; he has obtained money and experiences some happiness. How
should one respond to this? In accord with the factor of appreciative
joy, one rejoices in his happiness. Yet this is incorrect. Here, one
runs counter to true Dhamma practice by getting stuck on the level of
emotions. Although the emotions are positive, they may lead to trouble.
People may then condone stealing, causing all sorts of problems for
society.</p>
<p>Here is where wisdom brings about an integration and balance of the
mind. The wish here, referred to as equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>), is for other
people to possess rectitude and correctness.</p>
<p>Equanimity as an expression of wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) is the wish
for others to be well and complete. In order to reach completion, people
must align themselves with Dhamma, with righteousness. One abides in a
state of equanimity in order to allow correctness and righteousness to
proceed according to the laws of nature.</p>
<p>The first three factors, of kindness, compassion, and appreciative joy,
protect the individual; the fourth factor of equanimity also safeguards
the truth. If someone else commits a breach of truth, then one should
uphold and protect the truth, uphold justice and probity.</p>
<p>Fulfilment is reached with equanimity, which is an emotion connected to
wisdom. Equanimity acts to balance these four ’divine abidings’
(<em>brahmavihāra</em>). According to the Buddhist teachings, these four
factors are indeed divine forces, that is, they represent Brahma (the
highest divinity) and protect the world.</p>
<h2 id="wise-enjoyment-of-sense-pleasure"><a class="header" href="#wise-enjoyment-of-sense-pleasure">Wise Enjoyment of Sense Pleasure</a></h2>
<h3 id="diverse-grades-of-happiness"><a class="header" href="#diverse-grades-of-happiness">Diverse Grades of Happiness</a></h3>
<p>The Buddha stated that he had realized a sublime happiness independent
of sensuality (<em>kāma</em>), and for this reason he could assert that he
would not circle back to seek out sense pleasure again. Had he not
experienced this sublime happiness, he would not have been able to make
such an assertion.</p>
<p>The Buddha then went on to say that even though a noble disciple may
clearly discern with right wisdom that sense pleasure has little
sweetness and much suffering – much affliction and danger – if he has
not yet experienced the sublime bliss and happiness independent of
sensuality, then he cannot yet say with confidence that he will not
revert back in search of sense pleasure.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, he warned the monks in particular that if someone who has
gone forth has not yet savoured the sublime bliss and happiness
independent of sensual pleasures, it is still possible for various
defilements, like covetousness, ill-will, restlessness, laziness, and
boredom, to overwhelm the mind.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup> Such a person will not delight in
the holy life or will not be able to endure living the holy life.</p>
<p>Apart from demonstrating the importance Buddhism gives to happiness,
these references also reveal how noble disciples do not abandon sense
desire because sensuality is void of pleasure or because Buddhism
teaches to abstain from pleasure. Buddhism acknowledges pleasure and
happiness as it truly exists; it encourages people to practise in order
to achieve happiness and it recognizes that sensuality comprises one
form of happiness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Noble disciples abandon sense desire because they see that despite the
inherent pleasures of sensuality it is still mixed up with a great deal
of suffering. And importantly, there is a more profound form of
happiness, exceeding that of sense pleasure, exceeding the pleasures
derived from consuming the various delightful objects in the world.
Noble disciples abandon sense desire because they have savoured this
more refined form of happiness.</p>
<p>There are thus different levels of happiness; here we can examine how
Buddhism classifies them.</p>
<p>The Duka Nipāta of the Aṅguttara Nikāya separates happiness into various
kinds and degrees, providing a long list of pairs, including: the
happiness of householders and the happiness of renunciants, the
happiness of sensuality and the happiness of renunciation, mundane
happiness and transcendent happiness, and the happiness of noble beings
and the happiness of ordinary beings.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>A clear and detailed classification of the various levels of happiness
is the teaching on the ten levels of happiness which is found in many
places in the Tipiṭaka:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sense pleasure (<em>kāma</em>): joy and happiness dependent on the five
cords of sensuality (<em>kāma-guṇa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of the first jhāna (<em>paṭhamajhāna-sukha</em>): happiness of
the first jhāna, which is removed from sensuality and unwholesome
states, and is comprised of initial and sustained thought (<em>vitakka</em>
and <em>vicāra</em>), bliss (<em>pīti</em>), happiness (<em>sukha</em>), and
one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of the second jhāna (<em>dutiyajhāna-sukha</em>): happiness of
the second jhāna, which is comprised of bliss (<em>pīti</em>), happiness
(<em>sukha</em>), and one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>). {1025}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of the third jhāna (<em>tatiyajhāna-sukha</em>): happiness of the
third jhāna, which is comprised of happiness (<em>sukha</em>) and
one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of the fourth jhāna (<em>catutthajhāna-sukha</em>): happiness of
the fourth jhāna, which is comprised of equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>) and
one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of the attainment of the sphere of unbounded space
(<em>ākāsānañcāyatanasamāpatti-sukha</em>); in this concentrative
attainment one transcends the perception of form (<em>rūpa-saññā</em>) and
the perception of repulsion (<em>paṭigha-saññā</em>), and one pays no
attention to the perception of diversity (<em>nānatta-saññā</em>); one
directs attention solely on the infinity of space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of the attainment of the sphere of unbounded consciousness
(<em>viññāṇañcāyatanasamāpatti-sukha</em>); in this concentrative
attainment one meditates on the infinity of consciousness as one’s
object of attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of the attainment of the sphere of nothingness
(<em>ākiñcaññāyatanasamāpatti-sukha</em>); in this concentrative attainment
one meditates on the state of nothingness as one’s object of
attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of the attainment of the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-nonperception
(<em>nevasaññānāsaññāyatanasamāpatti-sukha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness associated with the attainment of the cessation of
perception and feeling (<em>saññāvedayitanirodhasamāpatti-sukha</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is possible to abbreviate these ten kinds of happiness into three
levels:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Happiness associated with sensuality (<em>kāma-sukha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness associated with jhāna (<em>jhāna-sukha</em>), or happiness
associated with the eight concentrative attainments
(<em>aṭṭhasamāpatti-sukha</em>), which can be further divided into two
sub-categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Happiness associated with the four fine-material jhānas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness associated with the four formless jhānas.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness associated with the attainment of cessation
(<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these aforementioned kinds of happiness are acknowledged as
constituting happiness, but they are seen as representing gradually more
refined and superior forms of happiness. The initial kinds of happiness
still contain harmful aspects and are tied up with suffering. The higher
forms of happiness are more refined and pure.</p>
<p>The scriptures teach to recognize these kinds of happiness as they truly
are, both their pleasurable aspects and those aspects tied up with
suffering, both their advantages (<em>assāda</em>; positive aspect) and
disadvantages (<em>ādīnava</em>; negative aspect), both their merits and
dangers. Moreover, they reveal the way out, the escape (<em>nissaraṇa</em>), or
the freedom from all conditioned states of happiness which is
independent of both the advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>When one sees the dangers of coarser forms of happiness, one becomes
disenchanted by them and aspires towards more refined happiness. And
when one has witnessed for oneself refined forms of happiness, one
abandons the coarser forms and seeks ever more sublime happiness. At the
very least one will not be overly engrossed in coarse pleasures.</p>
<p>Whenever people are liberated in a decisive way and the bonds of mental
defilement have been utterly severed, they will never return to seek out
coarser forms of happiness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup> They will experience only the refined
happiness corresponding to a liberated mind. Experiencing these
gradually more refined forms of happiness is one attribute of making
progress in Dhamma practice. {1026}</p>
<h3 id="sense-pleasure-and-superior-forms-of-happiness"><a class="header" href="#sense-pleasure-and-superior-forms-of-happiness">Sense Pleasure and Superior Forms of Happiness</a></h3>
<p>Following are some teachings that help to clarify the aforementioned
subject material:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, there are these five cords of sense pleasure (<em>kāma-guṇa</em>):
forms cognizable by the eye … sounds cognizable by the ear …
odours cognizable by the nose … tastes cognizable by the tongue …
tangibles cognizable by the body that are desirable, alluring,
likeable and agreeable, attractive and provocative of lust. These are
the five cords of sense pleasure. Now the happiness and joy that
arises dependent on these five cords of sense pleasure is the
gratification (<em>assāda</em>) in the case of sense pleasures….</p>
<p><em>M. I. 85.</em></p>
<p>The happiness and joy … is called sensual pleasure (<em>kāma-sukha</em>).</p>
<p><em>M. II. 42-3; S. IV. 225; A. IV. 415-16; Nd. II. 66-7.</em></p>
<p>The term ’kāma’ refers to two things: alluring material objects
(vatthu-kāma; desirable objects), and desire as mental impurity
(kilesa-kāma; mental defilement that breeds desire).</p>
<p>What are alluring material objects? Pleasing visual forms, sounds,
smells, tastes, and tangibles; rugs, blankets, female and male
servants, goats, sheep, chickens, pigs, elephants, cows, horses,
donkeys, rice paddies, land, silver, gold, houses, villages, royal
towns, states, countries, armies, and royal treasuries – whatever
material objects are the basis for attachment are called alluring
material objects. Furthermore, all objects of desire existing in the
past, present, and future; existing internally, externally, or both
internally and externally; those that are base, middling, and
superior; those belonging to beings in unhappy states of existence,
belonging to human beings, and belonging to the celestial realms;
those that are immediately at hand (paccupaṭṭhitā), those that are
self-created (nimmitā), and those that are created by others
(paranimmitā); those owned and those not owned; those coveted and
those not coveted; those that belong entirely to the sense sphere
(kāmāvacara), those that belong entirely to the fine-material sphere
(rūpāvacara), and those that belong entirely to the formless sphere
(arūpāvacara) – which are the basis for craving, the objects of
craving; they are called objects of desire on account of being a basis
for desire, on account of being a basis for infatuation. All of these
are called alluring material objects.</p>
<p>And what is desire as mental impurity? Delight is desire, lust is
desire, lustful attachment is desire; purpose (saṅkappa) is desire …
lustful preoccupation is desire; sensual desire (kāma-chanda), sensual
lust (kāma-rāga), sensual delight (kāma-nandi), sensual craving
(kāma-taṇhā), sensual attachment (kāma-sineha), passion for sensual
pleasure, infatuation for sensual pleasure, obsession with sensual
pleasure, sense desire engulfing the mind, sense desire binding the
mind, grasping to sensual pleasure, the hindrance of sensual desire,
sense desire in the phrase: ’Look here, sense desire, I see your
origin – you arise from intention. I will no longer be preoccupied
with you; by doing this you will remain no longer’ – all these are
called desire as mental impurity.</p>
<p><em>Nd. I. 1-2, 28.</em></p>
<p>Monks, the conception of an embryo in a womb takes place through the
union of three things. When there is the union of the mother and
father, and it is the mother’s season, and the being to be reborn is
present, through the union of these three things the conception of an
embryo in a womb takes place. The mother then carries the embryo in
her womb for nine or ten months with great risk to her life, as a
heavy burden. Then, at the end of nine or ten months, the mother gives
birth with great risk to her life, as a heavy burden. She then
nourishes the newborn child with her own blood; for the mother’s
breast-milk is called ’blood’ in the noble ones’ tradition.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup>

<p><em>M. I. 265-6.</em></p>
<p>’A young infant child, lying on his back, plays [even] with his own
urine and faeces. What do you think, isn’t that completely amusing for
that infant child?</p>
<p>’Yes, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>’Sometime later, when that child grows up and his faculties mature, he
plays the games that are typical for children – games with toy
ploughs, stick games, somersaults, games with pinwheels, game with
measures made of sand, games with toy chariots, games with toy bows.
What do you think, isn’t this amusement superior and more refined than
the former kind?’</p>
<p>’Yes, venerable sir.’</p>
<p>’At a still later time, as that boy continues to grow up and his
faculties mature still further, he enjoys himself furnished and
endowed with the five objects of sensual pleasure: with forms …
sounds … odours … tastes … tangibles that are are desirable,
alluring, likeable and appealing, attractive and provocative of lust.
What do you think, isn’t this amusement superior and more refined than
the former kind?’</p>

</div>
<p>Among householders the most exalted person is a universal emperor
(<em>cakkavatti</em>; ’wheel-turning monarch’), who wields supreme power and is
replete with material wealth. According to Buddhism such a person is
also endowed with superior virtue. A universal emperor is thus
considered to have the greatest amount of happiness, greater than that
generally experienced by other human beings. The Buddha referred to the
happiness of a universal monarch in order to describe the most complete
form of (ordinary) human happiness, and to compare it with various other
levels and degrees of happiness, revealing their relative subtlety and
profundity.</p>
<p>According to the ideal depiction, a universal emperor possesses seven
treasures (<em>ratana</em>) and four kinds of success (<em>iddhi</em>). The seven
treasures are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A precious wheel, signifying righteous and legitimate sovereignty.
It enables the emperor to extend his empire of peace across the
entire continent, reaching the oceans in all four directions, by
using righteous methods and sustained by the delight of those who
accept his rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A precious elephant, which is able to transport the emperor across
the entire continent quickly in order to inspect the royal domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A precious horse, which is likewise able to transport the emperor
across the entire continent quickly in order to inspect the royal
domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A precious and powerful gem, which radiates light across great
distances, enabling the emperor to move his troops at night or to
have citizens of the land work at night as if it were daytime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A precious queen, who besides having a beautiful body and complexion
surpassing that of all other women also possesses a marvellous
touch, described as ’gentle and soft as cotton or down’. When cold,
her body warms; when hot, her body cools. Her fragrance is as sweet
as sandalwood; her breath like the scent of a lotus. Moreover, she
speaks pleasing words and knows how to minister to all the wishes of
the emperor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A precious treasurer, who possesses the divine eye; he is able to
spot sources of wealth in all places and is able to find as much
gold and silver as the emperor desires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A precious advisor, who possesses exceptional talent at rulership.
Apart from offering correct counsel on official matters, he is able
to direct all sorts of work projects and issue royal decrees in
place of the emperor. {1028}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The emperor’s four kinds of success are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>his outward appearance is more handsome and majestic than that of
all other men;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his lifespan is longer than that of all other people;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he is healthy and strong, with few illnesses;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his subjects are loyal to him; they love him like children love
their parents, and he loves them as a father loves his children.
When he travels outside of the palace the people receive him and
wish to spend as much time as possible with him; he too wishes to
spend time with them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The happiness and pleasure of such an emperor is superior to that of
other people, including the young man referred to in the previous
quotation. Nevertheless, the Buddha said that however great is the
happiness of a universal emperor, it is paltry – even inconsequential
– when compared to the happiness of the celestial realms. It is similar
to comparing a small stone the size of one’s palm to the towering
Himalayas.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Although divine happiness (<em>dibba-sukha</em>) is an elevated form of sensual
pleasure, greatly exceeding the sense pleasure of human beings, there
exists a happiness more sublime than this. Such a latter form of sublime
happiness is independent of sensuality and of external objects of
gratification. Those who have experienced it feel no envy or desire when
they see someone else who is enjoying abundant sense pleasure. This is
similar to celestial beings, who feel no envy or delight in the inferior
happiness of human beings. Moreover, these individuals have no yearning
even for divine happiness, because they have experienced a superior form
of happiness.</p>
<p>In this context, the Buddha recounted his own experiences:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup></p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’So too, Māgandiya, formerly when I lived the home life, I enjoyed
myself, provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure:
with forms … sounds … fragrances … tastes … tangibles that are
are desirable, alluring, likeable and appeal-ing, attractive and
provocative of lust. I had three palaces, one for the rainy season,
one for the winter, and one for the summer. I lived in the rains’
palace for the four months of the rainy season, enjoying myself with
musicians who were all female, and I did not have to step out of the
palace for four months.</p>
<p>’On a later occasion, having understood as they actually are the
origin, the transience, the gratification, the danger, and the escape
in the case of sensual pleasures, I abandoned craving for sensual
pleasures, I dispelled the fever for sensual pleasures, and I abide
without thirst, with a mind inwardly at peace.</p>
<p>’I see other beings who are not free from lust for sensual pleasures
being devoured by craving for sensual pleasures, burning with fever
for sensual pleasures, indulging in sensual pleasures, and I do not
envy them nor do I delight therein. Why is that? Because I delight in
the happiness apart from sensual pleasures, apart from unwholesome
states. Therefore I do not envy what is inferior, nor do I delight
therein. {1029}</p>
<p>’Suppose, Māgandiya, a householder or a householder’s son was rich,
with great wealth and property, and being provided and endowed with
the five cords of sensual pleasure, he might enjoy himself…. Having
conducted himself well … he might reappear in a happy destination,
in the heavenly world in the retinue of the gods of the Thirty-Three;
and there, surrounded by a group of nymphs in the Nandana Grove, he
would enjoy himself, provided and endowed with the five cords of
divine sensual pleasure. Suppose he saw a householder or a
householder’s son enjoying himself, provided and endowed with the five
cords of sensual pleasure. What do you think? Would that young god …
envy the householder or the householder’s son for the five cords of
sensual pleasure, delight in the five cords of human sensual pleasure,
or be nostalgic for human sensual pleasures?’</p>
<p>’No, Master Gotama. Why not? Because heavenly sensual pleasures are
more excellent and sublime than human sensual pleasures.’</p>
<p>’So too, Māgandiya…. I do not envy them nor do I delight therein …
because I delight in the happiness apart from sensual pleasures, apart
from unwholesome states, which surpasses divine bliss. Therefore I do
not envy an inferior happiness, nor do I delight therein.’</p>

<h3 id="dangers-and-drawbacks-of-sense-pleasure"><a class="header" href="#dangers-and-drawbacks-of-sense-pleasure">Dangers and Drawbacks of Sense Pleasure</a></h3>
<p>What is <em>kāma</em>? As indicated in the quotation above, the term <em>kāma</em> has
two definitions. First, in can mean ’desire’, ’affection’, ’lust’, or
’yearning’. Second, it can mean ’object of desire’, ’object of
affection’, ’object of lust’, ’object of yearning’, ’object of
gratification’, ’something that stimulates pleasure’, ’something that
provides comfort’. This second definition refers to any person, living
being, material wealth, personal belonging, etc., which people possess
or hold on to in order to derive pleasure. In sum, these objects are
classified as the five ’strands of sensuality’ (<em>kāma-guṇa</em>): sights,
sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles that are desirable, that provide
sense pleasure (<em>kāma-sukha</em>). Sense pleasure is dependent on the five
senses and dependent on material things; it can also be referred to as
’carnal pleasure’ or as ’material happiness’ (<em>sāmisa-sukha</em> or
<em>āmisa-sukha</em>).</p>
<p>There are many kinds and degrees of sense pleasure, including exalted
and divine kinds of pleasure, all of which are recognized as forms of
happiness. Here, we shall focus on the flaws of sense pleasure and the
advantages of supreme happiness. We may ask why those people who have
experienced more refined happiness claim that it is superior to sense
pleasure and even relinquish sense pleasure altogether.</p>
<p>The dangers and drawbacks of <em>kāma</em> (here, both definitions of this term
are combined, i.e. desire and objects of desire) can be looked at from
three angles: in relation to an individual, in relation to <em>kāma</em>
itself, and in relation to the social behaviour of people indulging in
sensuality.</p>
<p>In terms of the individual, one can witness how people, through an
improper relationship to sense objects, generate suffering within
themselves. By behaving incorrectly in relation to the world around
them, they make things into objects of desire and cause themselves
misery.</p>
<p>In terms of <em>kāma</em> itself, one can discern the flaws of those things
sought after by people, and one can discern the flaws inherent in the
enjoyment and gratification derived from these things.</p>
<p>In terms of people’s behaviour, one can see how those people who seek
out and indulge in sense pleasure act in relation to society.</p>
<p>Note that although these three aspects can be distinguished, they are in
fact interconnected.</p>
<h4 id="the-individual"><a class="header" href="#the-individual">The individual</a></h4>
<p>Here the focus is on the process of creating suffering in line with
Dependent Origination (<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>). This begins with cognition
of various sense objects, followed by an erroneous mental attitude
towards these things. A person continually allows the stream of events
to follow the path of ignorance and craving until this process becomes
habitual. One can call this a habitual predilection for suffering or a
propensity for causing problems. The Buddha mentioned this process in
his description of human development, beginning with conception in the
womb until a person grows up as an adult. A part of this development was
quoted above; here, we continue this description: {1030}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>When that child grows up and his faculties mature still further, he
enjoys himself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual
pleasure…. On seeing a form with the eye, he lusts after it if it is
pleasing; he dislikes it if it is displeasing…. On hearing a sound
… on smelling an odour … on tasting a flavour … on touching a
tangible object … on cognizing a mind object, he lusts after it if
it is pleasing; he dislikes it if it is displeasing. He abides with
mindfulness of body unestablished, with a limited mind, and he does
not understand as it actually is the deliverance of mind and
deliverance by wisdom wherein those evil unwholesome states already
arisen cease without remainder.</p>
<p>Engaged as he is in pleasure and aversion, whatever feeling he feels
– whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant – he
is engrossed in that feeling, devoted to it, and preoccupied by it. As
he does so, delight (nandi; craving) arises in him. Now delight in
feelings [transforms into] clinging. With this clinging as
condition, there is becoming; with becoming as condition, birth; with
birth as condition, aging and death; sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief,
and despair all come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of
suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="kāma-itself"><a class="header" href="#kāma-itself">Kāma itself</a></h4>
<p>Here one focuses on the flaws of sense desire and on the objects of
sense desire. The Buddha frequently used the following analogies to
demonstrate how <em>kāma</em> provides relatively little satisfaction; instead
it creates much affliction and danger:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sense desire is similar to an exhausted and starving dog who is
thrown a bone covered with blood. It will gnaw on the bone until it
is tired and weak, without real satisfaction or fulfilment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense desire is similar to a vulture or hawk with a piece of meat in
its mouth; other raptors will swoop down as a mob and snatch the
meat away. People have no absolute ownership over material things;
others can snatch them away. Many different people desire the same
object, giving rise to rivalry, conflict, oppression, and even
killing. If one does not know how to relate responsibly towards
sense objects one will experience distress and torment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense desire is similar to a person holding a flaming grass torch
and walking upwind. Before long he will have to throw the torch down
or else his hands, arms and body will be burned, leading to severe
injuries or even death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense desire is similar to a blazing pit of coals. Someone who
cherishes his life knows that if he falls in he will die or be
severely injured. He does not want to fall in, but a strong man
grabs him by the arms and gradually drags him towards the pit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense objects are similar to a radiant and beautiful dream. Before
long the images fade and disappear; upon waking one sees nothing and
is left with a feeling of anguish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense objects are similar to borrowed possessions, which a person
shows off in order to appear fancy and smart. Other people will
admire them, but one will only be able to possess them temporarily
and with a sense of doubt; one has no true ownership over them.
Whenever the true owner (i.e. nature) asks for them back, one must
return them; there is no compromise. All that a person is left with
is his or her body-and-mind, which is constantly subject to rising
and passing away. {1031}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense objects are similar to a tree at the edge of the forest
bearing abundant fruit; those people who pass by and desire the
fruit will use whatever means at their disposal to acquire it. Those
who are able will climb the tree to gather the fruit, while those
who cannot will use other means; if they are foolish or evil-minded,
they will cut the entire tree down. If those people up in the tree
do not get down in time, the tree will fall on them, leading to
injury or even death.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense objects are similar to a chopping block. Meddling with them is
tantamount to risking losing one’s life by being chopped or slashed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense objects are similar to a spear or lance; they tend to stab and
pierce, wounding one and causing injury.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense objects are similar to the head of a snake; if one is exposed
to it, one must always live in distrust; one is unable to truly feel
secure or be at ease. The snake can strike at any time, placing one
in a constant state of danger.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The disadvantages or flaws of <em>kāma</em> can be summarized as follows:
objects of sense pleasure are only able to provide a desirable
sweetness, delectability, and enjoyment for the short duration that one
is experiencing them, but these objects, when they are related to
incorrectly, end up inflicting acute pain and distress for a long time.
Moreover, the fading and passing away of the enjoyment may cause sadness
and torment, leading to longstanding grief.</p>
<h4 id="social-behaviour"><a class="header" href="#social-behaviour">Social behaviour</a></h4>
<p>Here, an examination of the disadvantages of sense desire begins with
the suffering, hardship, and adversity inherent in earning a livelihood
and seeking material objects to use and consume. Everyone must endure
the hardships of climate and of physical and mental fatigue in earning a
living. Some people are so impoverished that they lose their lives in
the search for material things; other people make great effort in their
work, struggling with obstacles and exhaustion, but are unsuccessful;
they make no money or they go bankrupt, resulting in grief and anguish.
Even when one obtains such things, there is suffering in trying to
protect them. Some people experience such misfortunes as having their
possessions stolen by thieves or incinerated by fire, causing them
additional distress.</p>
<p>When ignorant people obtain material possessions they get enslaved by
them. Proud of their possessions – which are ultimately illusory and
have no inherent lasting existence – they look down on others, thus
increasing the woes of society. Some people are jealous of other
people’s possessions, leading to disputes, competition, and various
forms of oppression.</p>
<p>This interpersonal conflict is illustrated in this passage from the Pali
Canon: ’Kings dispute with kings, nobles dispute with nobles, brahmins
dispute with brahmins, merchants dispute with merchants, mothers dispute
with their children, children dispute with their mothers, fathers
dispute with their children, children dispute with their fathers,
brothers dispute with their brothers, sisters dispute with their
brothers, brothers dispute with their sisters, friends dispute with
friends.’ This conflict can spill out into physical fighting and even
murder.</p>
<p>Spurred on by various personal interests and fuelled by sense desire,
people take up arms and engage in war: shooting, stabbing, and bombing
one another. {1032} Likewise, they engage in various forms of immoral
behaviour, like theft, burglary, adultery, and rape. When they are
caught they receive various kinds of punishments. And when they die they
must experience further torment in planes of misery, bad destinations,
lower worlds, and hell. All of these actions and results are due to
sense desire.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Those who discern the aforementioned disadvantages and dangers of sense
desire (<em>kāma</em>), and who have experienced a superior kind of happiness,
to the point of no longer hankering after objects of sensual enjoyment,
also see into the true nature of sense pleasure (<em>kāma-sukha</em>). The
Buddha explained this matter by using another analogy, as follows:</p>
<p>Imagine a person with leprosy, whose body is deeply infected by the
disease and covered with lesions. He uses his fingernails to scratch at
the scabs and for relief he burns his flesh over a charcoal pit. At a
later time a doctor cures him of this illness, enabling him to live at
ease and to move about as he wishes. He sees other people suffering from
leprosy who scratch their wounds, cauterize their flesh, and take
medicine for their illness, but he feels no delight or gladness in
respect to these people. This is similar to those who formerly indulged
in objects of sense pleasure. When they later abandon craving for sense
pleasure and experience an internal peace and happiness that is
independent of sensuality and superior even to divine pleasures, they
feel no delight or hankering when they see others indulging in sense
pleasures.</p>
<p>If a strong person were to grab someone who has recovered from leprosy
and drag him towards a fire pit, he would struggle to escape, because of
the heat of the fire. The contact with the fire is now considered
painful, whereas formerly, when he had leprosy, he would seek out the
same hot fire voluntarily to grill his flesh, and he considered the
contact pleasurable. This is because a person afflicted with leprosy has
damaged faculties, leading to inverted or perverse perceptions
(<em>saññā-viparīta</em>) in the face of fire, experiencing pain as pleasure.
So too it is with sensuality.</p>
<p>In truth, all forms of sensuality entail painful contact and are marked
by burning and agitation. People are ordinarily infected by craving for
sensuality, however, and possess damaged and faulty faculties, giving
rise to warped perceptions about sensuality, experiencing the actual
pain as pleasure.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>The more a leper scratches and burns his lesions, the dirtier and more
putrid they become. His happiness and delight stems from scratching his
wounds, or exists at the point of the wound that is being scratched. As
long as he is not cured from this itch, he will be unable to know a
superior kind of happiness. He will be caught up in scratching – how
can one introduce him to a happiness that does not involve scratching
the itch? But when he is cured of this illness and is healthy, he will
be able to know a superior form of happiness, and from then on he will
not desire the pleasure derived by scratching an itch.</p>
<p>The same is true in respect to sense pleasure. When those people marred
by craving for sensuality experience sense pleasure, their craving
intensifies. Moreover, their happiness and delight is derived from and
limited to the five objects of sense pleasure. If they are still not
cured from the infection and inflammation of craving for sensuality, it
will not be possible for them to know a superior, more refined kind of
happiness. In this agitated state, how can one get them to experience an
internal happiness independent of external sense objects? {1033}</p>
<p>But when craving for sensuality no longer gnaws away at them, and they
are freed from the provocations of sense desire, they will be able to
experience a sublime, internal happiness. This is referred to as a
freedom from disease, an absence of mental disturbance, or perfect
mental health, which is one of the definitions for Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>In the Sakka Sutta the Buddha converses with a group of Sakyan
householders.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn30">30</a></sup> After being questioned, the Sakyans acknowledge that
someone who makes his living righteously and abstains from anything
unwholesome, and who as a result earns half a coin, a single coin, two
coins – all the way up to five hundred coins – per day, is worthy to
be called an enterprising person.</p>
<p>Yet even if such an enterprising person were to save up his earnings for
one hundred years, amassing a large quantity of wealth, this wealth
would not be able to provide him with pure, uninterrupted happiness for
a single day or even a half a day. This is because objects of sense
pleasure are impermanent, insubstantial, without any lasting reality,
subject to disappearance and decay. This differs from those who practise
according to the Buddha’s teachings and who attain the fruit enabling
them to abide in pure, unadulterated happiness for long periods of time.</p>
<h3 id="happiness-from-scratching-an-itch-and-happiness-from-the-itch-being-cured"><a class="header" href="#happiness-from-scratching-an-itch-and-happiness-from-the-itch-being-cured">Happiness from Scratching an Itch and Happiness from the Itch Being Cured</a></h3>
<p>To help review the Buddhist perspective on happiness, let us examine
once more the passages in the Māgaṇḍiya Sutta. This teaching outlines
the development of happiness, beginning with the pleasures experienced
by infants up to the supreme happiness of Nibbāna. In this sutta the
Buddha describes the pursuit and experience of various kinds of
happiness in people’s lives:</p>
<p>To begin with, a newly-born infant, lying in its cradle, may giggle and
find delight by smearing its own urine and excrement.</p>
<p>A few years later, this child no longer finds pleasure in such activity.
Rather, he or she likes to play in a sandbox or in the dirt, and enjoys
playing with toys, like dolls or miniature cars, trains, or airplanes.
Children find tremendous delight in toys, cherishing and clinging to
them. Some children have a favourite blanket, and no matter how ragged
or soiled it is, they cherish it intensely. If someone acts to take it
away from them, they will scream as if their life depended on it. {1100}</p>
<p>Children then develop into young adults at which time these toys are no
longer considered amusing; they provide them with no pleasure or
satisfaction. Instead, people derive another level of pleasure from
enjoyment by way of sense contact, by way of sights, sounds, smells,
tastes, and tangible objects.</p>
<p>From here happiness can be developed further. Yet if people fail to
develop higher forms of happiness and stop at the level of sense
pleasure, before long they will experience an inevitable despair, or at
the very least they will no longer be able to enjoy these pleasures, and
will encounter great suffering and affliction.</p>
<p>Those people who develop higher forms of happiness experience a refined
joy independent of pleasurable sense objects. They reach a free,
unconstrained happiness and become truly liberated.</p>
<p>When these liberated individuals observe others who indulge in sense
pleasure, they no longer consider this enjoyment of sense pleasure as a
form of satisfaction. Their attitude towards sense pleasure has changed,
similar to how an adult looks at children delighting in their toys.
Although they understand this delight, they look upon it with humour or
sympathy.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Buddha used the metaphor of a leper to
describe this development of happiness. Lepers feel extreme itchiness
due to the disease. As a result they scratch at their lesions, yet this
scratching only intensifies the itch. The more they scratch the more
they itch; the more they itch the more they scratch. Moreover, they
derive a sense of pleasure from scratching. Because of the discomfort
they also seek relief by burning their lesions by a fire. They find
happiness and satisfaction by burning themselves, which ordinary people
would find intolerable.</p>
<p>The Buddha once asked a brahmin what would happen if a leper met a
doctor with an effective medicine, resulting in the cure of this
illness. Would this person cured of leprosy still seek happiness from
scratching or desire to burn himself with a flame? The brahmin answered
that just the opposite would occur. If someone were to grab this man and
pull him towards a flame, he would struggle desperately to escape. The
Buddha pointed out how the development of happiness is similar. Someone
who has experienced a happiness superior to sense pleasure no longer
considers the enjoyment of sense objects as a source of satisfaction.</p>
<p>One can say that a significant percentage of human beings derive
happiness from scratching an itch. Those people who have developed
themselves to another level derive happiness from a freedom from
itching. Consider which of these kinds of happiness is superior.</p>
<p>Does a healthy person free from illness consider this state of health,
this state of wellbeing, to be happiness? Is not such freedom from
illness, freedom from affliction, freedom from chafing, itching, and
physical pain a true state of happiness?<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup> {1101} The state of
physical health, free from weakness and irritation, in which all of
one’s organs function well, is an inherent state of happiness. Indeed,
such health, such freedom from affliction, is a basic, primary form of
happiness aspired to by all people.</p>
<p>No matter what sort of happiness people aim for and no matter how
abundant are their material possessions, if they are deprived of
physical health, their objects of sense pleasure gradually lose
importance. Regardless of how bountiful are their objects of sense
pleasure, if people are impaired or ravaged by physical illness, these
things lose all of their value. Moreover, if their happiness was
invested in these things, the illness will only intensify suffering and
lead to a sickness of heart.</p>
<p>Let us turn our attention to the mind. A mind that is satisfied,
spacious, joyous, and bright, free from vexation and disturbance, is
inherently complete. Such a state of mind is in itself happiness, in the
same way as physical health is a form of happiness. In fact this
happiness is even greater than that of physical health, but because of
the mind’s refinement most people have difficulty gaining an insight
into it.</p>
<p>Take the example of someone in rude health. If he is in great mental
distress, no amount of material comforts can provide him with happiness.
In contrast, people whose minds are bright, cheerful, and free are happy
even when nothing is happening and when they abide in the most ordinary
and routine circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="enjoyment-of-sense-pleasures-without-affliction"><a class="header" href="#enjoyment-of-sense-pleasures-without-affliction">Enjoyment of Sense Pleasures without Affliction</a></h3>
<p>Normally speaking, sense pleasure and more refined kinds of happiness
are incompatible. This is because sense pleasure is tied up with
arousing and stimulating sense objects, accompanied by agitation and
anxiety, and dependent on external things for gratification. Refined
happiness, on the other hand, begins with peace of mind. The happiness
of jhāna, for example, arises when the mind is first secluded from
sensuality and secluded from unwholesome states.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is difficult for ordinary people to enjoy both sense
pleasures and more refined forms of happiness, especially the happiness
of jhāna, because whatever they delight in they also tend to attach to
and indulge in. When they are agitated and confused by the power of
sense desire, it is difficult for them to enter into the happiness of
jhāna. There are many stories of hermits and renunciants falling away
from jhāna because of an infatuation for sense pleasure. Only when one
is a noble being, beginning with stream-entry, can one enjoy sense
pleasures safely. For this reason the Buddha repeatedly encouraged
people to develop wisdom and have a proper relationship to sense
pleasure; only then can one escape from its power and influence.</p>
<p>In the Pāsarāsi Sutta the Buddha compares the five objects of sense
pleasure to a hunter’s snare. This teaching pertains to three groups of
ascetics and brahmins:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>First Group:</em> those ascetics and brahmins who enjoy the five cords
of sensuality (<em>kāma-guṇa</em>) with attachment, infatuation, and
indulgence, without a discernment of their dangers and without
liberating wisdom. They are similar to a deer captured in a snare;
they will meet with downfall and destruction, slaughtered by the
hunter – evil-minded Māra. {1036}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Second Group:</em> those ascetics and brahmins who enjoy the five cords
of sensuality without attachment, infatuation, and indulgence, with
a discernment of their dangers and with liberating wisdom. They are
similar to a deer lying on top of the snare but not caught in it.
They do not meet with downfall and destruction, and are not subject
to being carried off by the hunter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Third Group:</em> those bhikkhus who are secluded from sensuality,
secluded from unwholesome states, who have attained a level of
fine-material and immaterial jhāna, along with the cessation of
perception and feeling (<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>), and who have
brought the mental taints to an end (i.e. who have experienced
supreme happiness). They are called those who have blinded Māra, who
consequently cannot see any trace of them. They are similar to deer
who wander freely and at ease in a great forest, undetected by the
hunter.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From this sutta one can see that the Buddha did not simply teach to
abandon an involvement with objects of sensual pleasure. He also taught
a proper engagement to these things, by maintaining an independence in
relation to them. One thus does not become enslaved by them, and one
does not permit them to cause harm and to create suffering.</p>
<p>The involvement with sense objects belonging to the second group of
ascetics and brahmins above is the way of practice most emphasized for
general Dhamma practitioners. The key principle in this way of practice
is encapsulated in the term ’with liberating wisdom’, which is a
translation of the Pali <em>nissaraṇa-paññā</em>. It refers to wisdom that
knows how to lead one to freedom. It can also be defined as ’wisdom
escaping the enticements by craving’ or ’wisdom preventing entrapment by
craving’.</p>
<p>The commentaries generally define <em>nissaraṇa-paññā</em> as an ability to
reflect when using the four requisites, by focusing on the true purpose,
benefit, or value of these things.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup> For example, one uses clothing
primarily to ward off cold, heat, wind, and biting insects, and to cover
one’s private parts, not for boasting or for show. One eats food in
order to keep the body strong and at ease and so that one can perform
one’s activities, not for amusement, intoxication, or a sign of
extravagance.</p>
<p>The application of such wise reflection fosters inner independence,
prevents enslavement to material objects, and helps to avoid the dangers
and suffering stemming from spinning around in the vortex of moodiness,
of joy and sorrow, pleasure and disappointment. Moreover, it generates a
balanced use of the requisites, which is a boon for one’s life. Practice
endowed with liberating wisdom (<em>nissaraṇa-paññā</em>) is thus referred to
as ’knowledge of moderation’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>Someone who relates properly to sense pleasure will find it easy to
access more refined forms of happiness, as such happiness is dependent
on wholesome states of mind. When one has experienced refined happiness,
this happiness then helps in turn to guide one’s search for and
partaking of sense pleasure, keeping it within correct boundaries. This
is because one appreciates the value of more refined happiness. And when
one reaches higher states of realization, comprised of ever more
profound forms of happiness, one will not return to seek out sense
pleasure again. {1037}</p>
<h3 id="liberated-enjoyment-of-sense-pleasure"><a class="header" href="#liberated-enjoyment-of-sense-pleasure">Liberated Enjoyment of Sense Pleasure</a></h3>
<p>Noble disciples (<em>ariya-sāvaka</em>) are endowed with liberating wisdom
(<em>nissaraṇa-paññā</em>). They enjoy sensual or material pleasure with a
thorough understanding, preserving an inner freedom and avoiding
enslavement by material things. They use and consume things by
recognizing both their benefits as well as their potential harm. They
are able to manage things and manage affairs in a way that leads to the
wellbeing of themselves, their families, their companions, their
dependants, their coworkers, their community, and indeed of their entire
society. Moreover, they are aware, both in regard to themselves and to
others, of how to progress and develop on the noble path
(<em>ariya-magga</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>In reference to monks or monastic residents, who aim for higher forms of
happiness and freedom, the Buddha taught to abandon sensual desire and
to pass beyond material things. But in reference to householders, he did
not emphasize the abstinence from sensuality.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn36">36</a></sup> Instead, he
emphasized managing the consumption of material things and dwelling in
contentment in a way that is safe from ill-effects and conducive to the
greatest blessings for oneself and others.</p>
<p>Of course, liberating wisdom is also a key element for householders or
laypeople, both in respect to enjoying sense objects (<em>kāma-bhoga</em>)
safely – in a way conducive to benefit and free from affliction – and
to guiding one to greater levels of wellbeing. The Buddha thus
emphasized the constant application of such wisdom in the engagement
with all things, by clearly recognizing three principal factors: the
benefits, the dangers, and the escape, or in other words: the
advantages, the drawbacks or faults, and the point of deliverance and
freedom, which constitutes a state of completion, transcending both the
advantages and disadvantages that are still inseparably bound by one
another.</p>
<p>When teaching laypeople, who had either no understanding or only a basic
understanding of the Buddhist teachings, and who did not yet aspire to
renounce the household life, the Buddha usually began with basic levels
of practice followed by more refined levels. This teaching by the Buddha
is called the ’progressive instruction’ or ’gradual instruction’
(<em>anupubbikathā</em>).</p>
<p>The gradual instruction is comprised of five factors (three expositions
– <em>kathā</em> – and two related subjects). (See
Note <a href="#note-expositions">Expositions</a>) The three expositions are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dāna-kathā</em>: exposition on giving, renunciation, charity, and
generosity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīla-kathā</em>: exposition on moral conduct, on refraining from
exploitation of others, and on refraining from causing social
conflict and enmity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sagga-kathā</em>: exposition on ’heaven’, i.e. a virtuous, wholesome
life, which is endowed with happiness derived from sense objects
(<em>kāma-vatthu</em>). This exposition highlights those individuals,
including celestial beings, who live an upright life and enjoy
various levels of sense pleasure. This third factor is the result of
generosity and moral conduct. It points to a sense of responsibility
in creating a wholesome life and society, and to experiencing a
healthy form of sensual happiness.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This gradual teaching introduced those laypeople in the audience to the
highest goal that they were struggling to find. They were able to
recognize that when one lives one’s life in accord with the first two
principles of generosity and virtuous conduct, one will experience a
faultless form of happiness and enjoy abundant sense pleasures, as
described in the third factor, and one thus achieves one’s wishes.
{1038}</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Expositions</span><a id="note-expositions"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the Tipiṭaka and other scriptural texts only three ’expositions’
(<em>kathā</em>) are mentioned: <em>dāna-kathā</em>, <em>sīla-kathā</em>, and
<em>sagga-kathā</em>. The following two factors, ’disadvantages of sensual
pleasures’ (<em>kāmādīnava</em>) and ’benefits of renouncing sensual
pleasures’ (<em>nekkhammānisaṁsa</em>), are not followed by the word <em>kathā</em>.
They are related teachings describing the gist of the first three
factors, especially of <em>sagga-kathā</em>, and point out the way to
reaching more refined kinds of happiness. Later texts, however, added
the word <em>kathā</em> to these two factors. Even in some of the Pali
Tipiṭaka editions (the Burmese editions), commentaries, and
sub-commentaries, the term <em>kāmādīnava-kathā</em> was created and inserted
into the text (unlike the term <em>nekkhammānisaṁsakathā</em>, which is only
found in later texts).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>If the listener was prepared the Buddha would then continue by
describing the disadvantages of sense pleasures (<em>kāmādīnava</em>). He would
explain that, however great the pleasure dependent on material objects
may be, it still has a drawback or deficiency, paving the way to
suffering and loss. When the listener understood this fourth factor well
and wished for a way out, the Buddha would describe the benefits of
renouncing sense pleasures (<em>nekkhammānisaṁsa</em>), i.e. he would point out
a life of freedom, of independence from material things, and of
unconstrained happiness, which becomes a constant inner quality. The
listener would then become receptive and aspire to reach a happiness
independent of objects of sensuality (<em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>). This was how
the Buddha would develop a receptivity and readiness in people. He would
prepare their minds gradually, in a way epitomized by the expression of
old: ’cleansing and purifying a person’s disposition.’</p>
<p>The Tipiṭaka states that when the Buddha knew that the minds of his
listeners were receptive, malleable, unclouded, joyous and bright –
similar to a spotless cloth ready to receive dye – he would teach the
Four Noble Truths. When their minds were open, he would impart wisdom,
enabling them to arrive at the truth (<em>sacca-dhamma</em>), to be a personal
witness to truth, until there arose the ’eye of Dhamma’
(<em>dhamma-cakkhu</em>) and they would enter the community of the noble ones
(<em>ariya-puggala</em>), from stream-enterers upwards.</p>
<p>Most of these awakened individuals with the ’eye of Dhamma’ continue to
live as householders.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn37">37</a></sup> They still enjoy sensuality, but it is a
sensual happiness integrated with the happiness independent of material
things (<em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>), which acts as a guarantee, preventing
sensuality from causing harm and indeed generating blessings and virtue.
These noble beings act as pillars and exemplars, exercising authority in
their communities. And they advance without fail, without decline, on
the noble path.</p>
<p>In sum, however delicious, sparkling, refreshing, remarkable, or
desirable sense pleasure (<em>kāma-sukha</em>) or material happiness
(<em>sāmisa-sukha</em>) may be, it still depends on external objects – it is
not yet free and independent. It still involves some form of personal
attachment and possession.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the insatiable search for sense gratification, other
people are bent on pursuing the same objects of pleasure, of which the
finest and most desirable are of a limited and inadequate number. People
vying for these things treat each other with distrust, giving rise to
disagreements, conflicts, zealous guarding of possessions, and
oppression. If people do not know how to control their desires, this
oppression intensifies, leading to increased distress and unbounded
destruction.</p>
<p>Even if one does own these material things to one’s heart’s content,
they may disappear. And even if they do not disappear, they may lose
their appeal, either by undergoing change themselves or as a result of a
change in the individual. In any case they must eventually decline and
disintegrate – they cannot be sustained in that desirable condition
forever – and one must be separated from these things in the end.</p>
<p>Hand-in-hand with sense pleasure comes worry and anxiety. Although
people may experience sensual happiness to fulfilment, apart from
people’s innate insatiability causing problems, that happiness itself is
neither secure, reliable, nor replete. It is as if one is plagued by an
imbedded and infected splinter or barb that causes irritation and
annoyance. The pleasure is mixed up with suffering. The future is full
of fear and anticipation, the past full of sorrow and regrets. It is not
a pure, faultless, spacious, and complete form of happiness. {1039}</p>
<p>Although more refined forms of happiness are internal, independent,
pure, and harmless, if one’s enjoyment of this happiness is still mixed
with mental defilement, one may succumb to indulgence, giving rise to
heedlessness and neglect; one’s responsibilities and the wellbeing of
one’s community will be undermined. Moreover, one may fall back to
indulging in material pleasures and forget to put effort into spiritual
practice in order to eliminate residual mental impurities, which are the
root of suffering. One’s practice will thus be faulty and compromised.</p>
<p>Therefore, both sensual happiness and happiness independent of material
things experienced by those who still have mental defilements is not yet
truly free or complete, because these people harbour a sense of self
that gets caught up with things; they have not yet eradicated the root
of suffering. They must engage in spiritual cultivation until they
arrive at the destruction of the taints (<em>āsavakkhaya</em>) – the state
free from suffering, by which one does not grasp at anything, and
nothing ’sticks’ to the mind, just as water does not stick to a lotus
leaf. A person’s body lives in the world, but the mind transcends the
world. One passes beyond both suffering and the happiness dependent on
sensation (<em>vedanā</em>), including refined sensations generated in the
mind, and one reaches supreme happiness, which does not involve ’feeding
on’ sensation. This happiness is completely satisfying and it is
complete in itself. It can be compared to perfect physical health.
Nothing disturbs or irritates the mind; it is clear, calm, pure, bright,
and at ease.</p>
<p>When one has reached utter and total freedom, and there is no ’self’ to
get entangled in anything, one is happy in every situation and nothing
remains to be done in respect to personal desires. If one seeks out
happiness this is done for the sake of the world, for the wellbeing and
happiness of all beings. This is the supreme happiness of freedom from
suffering; it lies beyond the reach of affliction, and it constitutes
the highest goal of every human being.</p>
<p>Despite the drawbacks and disadvantages of sense pleasure, it is still
one form of happiness, which has a bearing on the majority of people.
Because of its potential for causing suffering, both for individuals and
for society, it is very important to guard against and to rectify any
harm it creates. In sum, sense pleasure must be managed carefully, and
people ought to be encouraged to develop themselves in order to
experience higher forms of happiness.</p>
<p>The skilful management of sense pleasure is a necessary asset at
beginning stages of practice. Although sense pleasure contains defects
it can still benefit one’s life and help lead to a peaceful coexistence
with others. Moreover, it is a basis from which people can develop
themselves and discover greater blessings. For this reason, in
systematic presentations of happiness, well-managed sense pleasure is
classified as a basic benefit (<em>attha</em>) which is to be aspired to and
reached. It is referred to as a ’present benefit’
(<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>): a visible, obvious, and immediate benefit. The
benefit here refers precisely to the happiness derived from material
things.</p>
<p>’Present benefit’ (<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>) refers to happiness on the
material level (<em>rūpa-dhamma</em>). It is tied up with material things
(<em>vatthu</em>), with objects of gratification and consumable things.
Moreover, it pertains to communal living, to creating wholesome,
supportive interpersonal relationships. In sum, this benefit involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Diligence in performing one’s work and in earning one’s living, in
order to obtain enough material wealth to look after oneself, one’s
family, and one’s dependants, so that everyone is at ease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maintaining wholesome social relationships and communal harmony;
having a respectable position in society, in addition to receiving
honour and prestige and having a supportive retinue or staff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sustaining one’s family in comfort; establishing one’s family as a
respectable model for others and in a way conducive to the wellbeing
of society.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking care of one’s body, for instance by exercising and showing
moderation in eating, so that one lives without illness and remains
healthy. {1040}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In regard to more refined happiness, which is internal and independent
of material things (<em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>), it too is a benefit and
aspiration for life, referred to as <em>samparāyikattha</em>: ’future benefit’,
’spiritual benefit’, ’profound benefit’, or ’inconspicuous benefit’.</p>
<p>In terms of ’present benefit’, the happiness resulting from having
abundant consumable goods is obvious for all to see. But in terms of
’spiritual benefit’, helping another person to escape from suffering
leads to even greater rejoicing and delight. Similarly, feeling deeply
moved and inspired by truth and goodness, with an accompanying joy and
peace, is a spiritual happiness not clearly visible to others. Moreover,
such happiness connected to virtue bears results in future lives, which
are also inconspicuous. For these reasons it is referred to as
<em>samparāyikattha</em>: ’inconspicuous benefit’ or ’future benefit’.</p>
<p>The meaning of the term <em>samparāyikattha</em> includes all forms of
internal, refined forms of happiness, beginning with the joy derived
from faith (<em>saddhā</em>), from living a virtuous life (<em>sīla</em>), from
concentration (<em>samādhi</em>), and from jhāna, all the way up to the
happiness of Nibbāna (<em>nibbāna-sukha</em>). For this reason, in most suttas
only two kinds of benefit are mentioned: ’present benefit’ and ’future
benefit’. This is suitable when teaching people in general; it describes
the happiness that they are familiar with in their everyday lives, and
it introduces higher forms of happiness in a way that is easy to
understand.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, much of the happiness classified as ’independent’
or ’non-material’ (<em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>) is not yet complete; it is still
subject to reversal and potentially mixed up with attachment and
heedlessness. Therefore, in relation to those people who have a good
basis of understanding, it is sometimes necessary to make a more
detailed distinction. In this case the true happiness of the extinction
of the taints (<em>āsavakkhaya</em>) – the happiness of the arahants or the
happiness of Nibbāna – is distinguished from <em>samparāyikattha</em>, and
given the name ’supreme benefit’ (<em>paramattha</em>).</p>
<p>In sum, this term <em>attha</em>, which refers to the purpose or objective of
life, can be divided simply into two kinds: visible benefit and
inconspicuous (i.e. spiritual) benefit (including the supreme benefit).
A more detailed division, however, is into three kinds:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn38">38</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Visible benefit (<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>) emphasizes physical health,
material possessions, honour, friendship, and a happy home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inconspicuous benefit (<em>samparāyikattha</em>) emphasizes having a
wholesome, refined, and happy mind by way of spiritual development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supreme benefit (<em>paramattha</em>) refers to having comprehensive
wisdom, leading to true purity, clarity, happiness, and liberation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides encouraging people to gradually reach these three kinds of
benefit, the Buddha also taught to broaden one’s perspective, so that
one develops these benefits not only for oneself but also for the sake
of others. There is thus a second group of three benefits:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn39">39</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Self-benefit (<em>attattha</em>): to generate the above three kinds of
benefit for oneself; to develop oneself in order to reach these
three benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benefit of others (<em>parattha</em>): to assist others in reaching the
three above benefits by supporting them in spiritual
self-development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mutual benefit (<em>ubhayattha</em>): the shared benefits and assets of a
community or society (including the shared environment), which
should be nurtured and cared for in order to support oneself and
others in reaching the three aforementioned benefits. {1041}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Due to the importance of how sense pleasure is managed and engaged with,
the Buddha gave teachings to householders on spiritual qualities leading
to ’present benefit’, for example on how to deal with material
possessions in a correct and supportive manner. These teachings are
scattered throughout the Tipiṭaka.</p>
<p>When providing teachings on visible benefit, besides emphasizing
liberating wisdom (<em>nissaraṇa-paññā</em>), the Buddha also combined
teachings on qualities conducive to spiritual benefit
(<em>samparāyikattha</em>). This is because the qualities accompanying refined
happiness act as a guarantee both for preventing sense pleasure from
harming oneself and for preventing it from harming others or society.
Instead, people will be able to apply their enjoyment of sense pleasure
to assist others and provide for their wellbeing. Moreover, these
teachings remind people to make the effort in developing more refined
forms of happiness.</p>
<p>There are various names for the factors conducive to the development by
householders in spiritual benefit (including the supreme benefit) which
help to regulate people’s relationship to sense pleasure. The chief of
these terms is <em>ariyā vaḍḍhi</em>: ’noble growth’. There are five such
factors:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn40">40</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Faith (<em>saddhā</em>): firm confidence in the blessings of the Triple
Gem, the gist of which lies with faith in the Tathāgata’s awakening
(<em>tathāgatabodhi-saddhā</em>) – faith in the wisdom of the Buddha which
enables people to be awakened themselves. This is equivalent to
confidence in human nature, which can be trained to the point of
excellence, of comprehensive wisdom and liberation. This confidence
is considered the starting point of spiritual development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtuous conduct (<em>sīla</em>): to conduct one’s life in a harmless way,
by upholding the five precepts, which may be developed into the
eight precepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning (<em>suta</em>): to listen to, reflect on, and analyze teachings
in order to gain an essential understanding of them, especially
those teachings conducive to spiritual growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generosity (<em>cāga</em>): charity; relinquishment; to lead the household
life without being miserly; being receptive to the suffering of
others and ready to share what one has and to offer assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wisdom (<em>paññā</em>): to gain a comprehensive understanding of the
truth; to have insight into arising and dissolution; to extricate
oneself from unwholesome qualities; to reach a state where mental
defilements find no footing; to be able to bring suffering to
cessation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these five factors, the four essential factors are faith, virtuous
conduct, generosity, and wisdom; learning here is considered expedient
but optional. Of course it is favourable to have learning, especially to
be one of great learning (<em>bahussuta</em>), but technically this factor is
dispensable. Wisdom is the paramount factor. When wisdom is present
there is less reliance on formal learning. By the same token, no matter
how much one has learned, if one lacks wisdom one cannot reach true
success. In any case, these five factors are considered assets to one’s
life.</p>
<p>Of the various teachings in the Tipiṭaka on managing sense pleasure
there is one long teaching comprising the Siṅgālaka Sutta, which
describes a system for conducting one’s life as a householder, in
reference to one’s immediate family, to one’s community, and to society
in general. The commentators say that this sutta constitutes a
’discipline for laypeople’ (<em>gihi-vinaya</em>) or a ’code of living for
noble beings’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup> {1042}</p>
<p>At the start of the Siṅgālaka Sutta the Buddha refers to this code of
living as a ’noble discipline’ (<em>ariya-vinaya</em>). And at the end of the
sutta he speaks a verse describing the principles for building social
stability and harmony, which are called the four ’bases of social
solidarity’ (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn42">42</a></sup></p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Giving gifts, kindly speech,<br />
Wholesome deeds, and impartiality in all things:<br />
Towards those worthy of such support,<br />
One should practise [these four things] properly.</em></p>
<p>These four things are people’s mainstay in the world,<br />
Similar to the axle-pin of a moving chariot.<br />
If they did not exist, no mother from her son<br />
Would receive honour or respect, nor father either.</p>
<p>Since the wise uphold these favourable qualities,<br />
They attain to a state of distinction,<br />
And are rightly praised by all.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Both the teachings on ’noble growth’ and on the four ’bases of social
solidarity’ pertain to a refined form of sensual happiness, which acts
as a link between ’material benefit’ and ’spiritual benefit’. In shorter
teachings by the Buddha, however, ’material benefit’ or ’present
benefit’ (<em>diṭṭhadhammikattha</em>) usually refers to material wealth,
because economic factors are of such central importance to the life of
householders and they incorporate almost all facets of a layperson’s
life. When looking at only these select suttas, it is thus easy to get
the impression that ’present benefit’ refers exclusively to material
wealth.</p>
<p>Below are some additional teachings by the Buddha on ’present benefit’.
Some of these emphasize material wealth, while others act as a bridge to
realizing ’spiritual benefit’.</p>
<p>To begin with, however, let us look at a sutta in which ’present
benefit’ refers to another aspect of sense pleasure not tied up with
material wealth. Here, the emphasis is on attending to one’s physical
health:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The Buddha was residing at Sāvatthī…. On that occasion King Pasenadi
of Kosala had eaten a pot-measure of rice with delicacies. Then when
he had finished eating, cramped and discomforted, the king approached
the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One, having understood that King Pasenadi had eaten
and was cramped and discomforted, on that occasion recited this verse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>’When a man is always mindful,<br />
Knowing moderation in the food he eats,<br />
 His ailments duly diminish,<br />
He ages slowly, and he lives long.’</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now on that occasion the brahmin youth Sudassana was standing behind
King Pasenadi of Kosala. The king then addressed him thus: ’Come now,
dear Sudassana, learn this verse from the Blessed One and recite it to
me whenever I am taking my meal. I will then present you daily with a
hundred kahāpaṇas as a cost for the meal.’</p>
<p>’Yes, sire’, the brahmin youth Sudassana replied. Having learned this
verse from the Blessed One, whenever King Pasenadi was taking his meal
the brahmin youth Sudassana recited [it].</p>
<p>Then King Pasenadi of Kosala gradually restrained himself until his
intake of food was at most a small-pot measure of boiled rice. {1043}
At a later time when his body had become energetic and spry, King
Pasenadi of Kosala stroked his limbs with his hand and on that
occasion uttered this inspired utterance:</p>
<p>’The Blessed One showed compassion towards me in regard to both kinds
of good – the present good (diṭṭhadhammikattha) and the higher good
(samparāyikattha).’</p>
<p><em>Doṇapāka Sutta: S. I. 81.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The following sutta on present benefit describes a proper engagement
with sense pleasure and emphasizes the relationship to material wealth,
but it too provides a link to higher, spiritual benefit. Note that this
sutta was given to the wealthy merchant Anāthapiṇḍika, who was a
stream-enterer. Note also that in regard to the first three kinds of
happiness below, the term ’clansman’ (<em>kula-putta</em>) is used, while in
regard to the fourth kind of happiness the term ’noble disciple’
(<em>ariya-sāvaka</em>) is used (indicating a rise to higher, spiritual
benefit):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, paid
homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One said to him:</p>
<p>’Householder, there are these four kinds of happiness that may be
regularly achieved by a layperson who enjoys sensual pleasures….
What four? The happiness of owning wealth (atthi-sukha), the happiness
of spending wealth for consumption (bhoga-sukha), the happiness of
freedom from debt (anaṇa-sukha), and the happiness of blameless
actions (anavajja-sukha).</p>
<p>’And what, householder, is the happiness of ownership? Here, a
clansman has acquired wealth by energetic striving, amassed by the
strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous
wealth righteously gained. When he thinks, “I have acquired wealth by
energetic striving … righteously gained”, he experiences happiness
and joy. This is called the happiness of ownership.</p>
<p>’And what is the happiness of consumption? Here, with wealth acquired
by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by
the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, a clansman
enjoys his wealth and does meritorious deeds. When he thinks, “With
wealth acquired by energetic striving … righteously gained, I enjoy
my wealth and do meritorious deeds”, he experiences happiness and joy.
This is called the happiness of consumption.</p>
<p>’And what is the happiness of freedom from debt? Here, a clansman has
no debts to anyone, whether large or small. When he thinks, “I have no
debts to anyone, whether large or small”, he experiences happiness and
joy. This is called the happiness of freedom from debt.</p>
<p>’And what is the happiness of blamelessness? Here, householder, a
noble disciple is endowed with blameless bodily, verbal and mental
action. When he thinks, “I am endowed with blameless bodily, verbal
and mental action”, he experiences happiness and joy. This is called
the happiness of blamelessness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>’Having realized the happiness of freedom from debt,<br />
One should recall the happiness of ownership.<br />
While spending one’s wealth,<br />
One sees clearly the happiness of material wealth (bhoga-sukha).<br />
When seeing things clearly, the wise one<br />
Knows both kinds of happiness, [and sees that]<br />
The other three are not worth a sixteenth part<br />
Of the bliss of blamelessness.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn43">43</a></sup> {1044}</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>A. II. 69.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The following sutta makes a clear distinction between present benefit
and spiritual benefit, the latter acting as both a support and a
constraint for the former:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Koliyans<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn44">44</a></sup>
near the Koliyan town named Kakkarapatta. There the young Koliyan
Dīghajāṇu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to
one side, and said:</p>
<p>’Venerable sir, we are laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, living at
home in a house full of children. We use sandalwood from Kāsi; we wear
garlands, scents, and unguents; we welcome gold and silver. Let the
Blessed One teach us the Dhamma in a way that will lead to our welfare
and happiness in this present life and in the future.’</p>
<p>’There are, Byagghapajja,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn45">45</a></sup> these four things that lead to the
welfare and happiness of a clansman in this present life. What four?
Accomplishment in diligence, accomplishment in protection, good
friendship, and balanced living.</p>
<p>’And what is accomplishment in diligence? Here, whatever may be the
means by which a clansman earns his living – whether by farming,
trade, raising cattle, military service, government service, or some
other craft – he is skilful and diligent; he possesses sound judgment
in order to carry out and arrange it properly. This is called
accomplishment in diligence.</p>
<p>’And what is accomplishment in protection? Here, a clansman sets up
protection and guard over the wealth he has acquired through
perseverance, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat
of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, thinking: ’How can I
prevent kings from confiscating it, thieves from stealing it, fire
from burning it, floods from sweeping it off, and displeasing heirs
from squandering it?’ This is called accomplishment in protection.</p>
<p>’And what is good friendship? Here, in whatever village or town a
clansman lives, he associates with householders or their sons – both
young and old who are of mature conduct – who are endowed with faith,
virtuous behaviour, generosity, and wisdom; he converses with them and
consults with them. Insofar as they are accomplished in faith, he
emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in faith; insofar
as they are accomplished in virtuous behaviour, he emulates them with
respect to their accomplishment in virtuous behaviour; insofar as they
are accomplished in generosity, he emulates them with respect to their
accomplishment in generosity; insofar as they are accomplished in
wisdom, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in
wisdom. This is called good friendship.</p>
<p>’And what is balanced living? Here, a clansman leads a balanced life,
living neither too extravagantly nor too frugally. He knows the way
his wealth increases and declines, [aware]: ’In this way my income
will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse.’ Just as an
appraiser or his apprentice, holding up a scale, knows: “By so much it
has dipped down, by so much it has has gone up….” If this clansman
has a small income but lives luxuriously, others would say of him:
“This clansman eats his wealth just like an eater of figs.” (See
Note <a href="#note-ripe-figs">Ripe Figs</a>) And if he has a large income but lives
austerely, others would say of him: “This clansman may even die as a
pauper.” But it is called balanced living when a clansman leads a
balanced life…. {1045}</p>
<p>’See here, Byagghapajja, the wealth thus righteously gained has four
pathways to ruin (apāya-mukha): womanizing, drunkenness, gambling, and
bad friendship, bad companionship, bad comradeship. Just as if there
were a large reservoir with four inlets and four outlets, and a man
would close the inlets and open the outlets, and sufficient rain does
not fall, one could expect the water in the reservoir to decrease
rather than increase….</p>
<p>’The wealth thus righteously acquired has four pathways to gain: one
avoids womanizing, drunkenness, and gambling, and cultivates good
friendship, good companionship, good comradeship. Just as if there
were a large reservoir with four inlets and four outlets, and a man
would open the inlets and close the outlets, and sufficient rain
falls, one could expect the water in the reservoir to increase rather
than decrease….</p>
<p>’These are the four things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a
clansman in this very life.</p>
<p>’There are, Byagghapajja, these four things that lead to the welfare
and happiness of a clansman in the future. What four? Accomplishment
in faith, accomplishment in virtuous behaviour, accomplishment in
generosity, and accomplishment in wisdom.</p>
<p>’And what is accomplishment in faith? Here, a clansman is endowed with
faith. He places faith in the awakening of the Tathāgata thus: “The
Blessed One is an arahant … the Enlightened One, the Exalted
One.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn46">46</a></sup> This is called accomplishment in faith.</p>
<p>’And what is accomplishment in virtuous conduct? Here, a clansman
abstains from the destruction of life … from intoxicants, that is,
spirits and alcoholic beverages, which are the basis for heedlessness.
This is called accomplishment in virtuous conduct.</p>
<p>’And what is accomplishment in generosity? Here, a clansman dwells at
home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous,
openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity,
delighting in giving and sharing. This is called accomplishment in
generosity.</p>
<p>’And what is accomplishment in wisdom? Here, a clansman is wise; he
possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is
noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of
suffering. This is called accomplishment in wisdom.</p>
<p>’See here, Byagghapajja, these are the four things that lead to the
welfare and happiness of a clansman in the future.’</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enterprising in his occupations,<br />
Heedful in his management,<br />
Balanced in his way of living,<br />
He safeguards the wealth he earns.<br />
Endowed with faith, accomplished in virtue,<br />
Charitable and devoid of miserliness,<br />
He constantly purifies the path<br />
That leads to safety in the future.</strong></p>
<p>Thus these eight qualities<br />
Of the faithful householder<br />
Are said by the Truthful One<br />
To lead to happiness in both ways:<br />
To good and welfare in this very life,<br />
And to happiness in the future.<br />
Thus for those dwelling at home,<br />
Their generosity and merit increase.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn47">47</a></sup></p>

<p>Although still enjoying sense pleasures, when laypeople are able to
engage with this enjoyment in a way that generates present benefits and
they gain a familiarity with more refined spiritual benefits, it can be
expected that they will prosper and experience a reliable, harmless form
of happiness. Moreover, they will help to generate lasting social
wellbeing and prosperity. {1046}</p>

<h3 id="comparison-of-different-kinds-of-happiness"><a class="header" href="#comparison-of-different-kinds-of-happiness">Comparison of Different Kinds of Happiness</a></h3>
<p>When compared with more refined kinds of happiness it is normal that
sense pleasure will be reduced in value. In comparison to the happiness
of jhāna, for example, sense pleasure is described as: ’ordinary
happiness’ (<em>puthujjana-sukha</em>; the happiness of unawakened people);
’contaminated (or festering) happiness’ (<em>mīḷha-sukha</em>);<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn48">48</a></sup> and
’inferior happiness’ (<em>anariya-sukha</em>). Furthermore, it is described as
consisting of suffering, affliction, and obstruction, and constituting
the wrong way of practice (<em>micchā-paṭipadā</em>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the happiness of jhāna, or ’internal happiness’
(<em>ajjhatta-sukha</em>), is described as: ’happiness free from sensuality’
(<em>nekkhamma-sukha</em>); ’happiness based on seclusion’ (<em>paviveka-sukha</em>);
’happiness conducive to peace (and to realizing Nibbāna)’
(<em>upasama-sukha</em>); and ’happiness conducive to awakening’
(<em>sambodhi-sukha</em>). It is free from suffering, distress and affliction,
and it constitutes correct spiritual practice (<em>sammā-paṭipadā</em>), which
leads to liberation, to Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the Buddha frequently denigrates and points out the dangers of
sense pleasure, this does not mean that he was set on condemning or
despising it. {1035} From one perspective, the Buddha was simply trying
to point out the truth behind sense pleasure. Ordinary people, however,
who are often ensnared by mental defilements, often view his teachings
as excessively severe. Moreover, by comparing sensual happiness
cherished by most people with a more refined form of happiness, he
devalued the former in order to elevate the latter.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, sense pleasure is an unyielding and tenacious
snare in which most people are caught up and from which it is difficult
to escape. The Buddha thus heavily criticized sense pleasure, along with
praising more refined forms of happiness, in order to urge people to
make haste in their spiritual practice, to avoid complacency, and to
experience supreme happiness.</p>
<p>Not all people who realize more refined kinds of happiness immediately
abandon sensual happiness. Many people continue to live their lives by
enjoying both kinds or both levels of happiness. In these circumstances
such people have more options or have a greater advantage in regard to
experiencing happiness.</p>
<p>In sum, the Buddha emphasized heedfulness and an awareness that, whether
one abandons sensual pleasure or not, it is imperative to realize more
refined forms of happiness within oneself and to develop these until one
reaches supreme happiness.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-to-choose-from-various-forms-of-happiness"><a class="header" href="#freedom-to-choose-from-various-forms-of-happiness">Freedom to Choose from Various Forms of Happiness</a></h3>
<p>Some people fear that if they reach Nibbāna they will no longer be able
to enjoy sense pleasure. In response, one can say: ’Fear not. If you
reach Nibbāna you will experience abundant happiness, greater than any
happiness you now know. You will have many kinds of happiness to choose
from. If you wish to enjoy sense pleasures, you may, and you will enjoy
them more than you do now, because nothing in the mind will exist to
spoil their sweetness.’ But by answering in this way other people may
protest: ’How is it possible that someone who has realized Nibbāna would
return to enjoy sense pleasures?’</p>
<p>These are not matters one need worry about; they resolve themselves
naturally and automatically. Those people who have realized Nibbāna are
optimally suited to enjoy all kinds of happiness. Which level of
happiness they choose to experience is up to their own discretion. (For
example, it is well documented that those individuals who have
experienced the happiness of Nibbāna access the four jhānas as an
’abiding at ease in the present’ – <em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>.)</p>
<p>Having said this, it occurs naturally by itself that those persons who
realize Nibbāna do not seek out sense pleasures. This is not because
they are unable to enjoy such pleasures, but rather they have no
inclination to do so. They have no mental defilements which would prompt
them to indulge in sensuality, and they have experienced superior states
and thus no longer see pleasurable sense objects as worthy of
involvement.</p>
<p>This is similar to some people’s speculation that arahants, having
clearly discerned the characteristic of nonself – the truth that human
beings are comprised simply of a convergence of elements and possess no
fixed, lasting identity – may be able to kill others blamelessly. But
this clear knowledge and vision of nonself only occurs when the
defilement of hatred prompting one to kill has been eradicated. It is
therefore impossible for arahants to kill.</p>
<p>A comparison to awakened beings not seeking out sense pleasure is that
of a person who was previously imprisoned. While in prison the prisoner
relied on certain activities or objects for amusement and entertainment,
as a way to forget about his discomfort and confinement. Later, when
there is an opportunity to escape from prison, some people are so
attached to the sources of entertainment that they refuse to leave,
while others get caught in worry and indecision. Those who truly
recognize and appreciate their freedom, however, will gradually
disengage from those pleasurable activities, leave the prison, and soon
let go of all longing for that state of incarceration.</p>
<p>The Buddha himself earlier delighted in sense pleasure and then later
became familiar with more refined forms of happiness, both the happiness
of jhāna and the happiness of Nibbāna. He thus knew all forms of
happiness. His teachings were shaped by his own direct experience,
acting as a solid confirmation of the validity of these teachings.</p>
<p>Let us review some of the disadvantages and flaws of sense pleasure,
when one compares it to more refined forms of happiness, in particular
the happiness of Nibbāna:</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> It creates a dependency on, even an enslavement to, external
things; it is not free and independent. We can easily be deceived into
thinking that we possess and control material things, but the greater is
our attachment to them, the weaker is our power and the stronger is the
enslavement.</p>
<p>There are two stages to this enslavement or dependency: {1054}</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Before obtaining sense objects, craving for sense pleasure dictates
one’s actions, so that one chases after things in order to
experience pleasant sensations. If the desire is very strong, one
will dedicate one’s life to such a pursuit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one has obtained these objects, they cause one to fret further
by generating adoration, hate, greed, aversion, and delusion. One’s
behaviour is then shaped by these defilements. Craving prompts the
search for sensation; sensation then reinforces craving. This cycle
goes on perpetually.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the inevitable, natural change and alteration of things is
oppressive for people who harbour such craving, leading to grief and
distress.</p>
<p>Internal, non-material happiness, on the other hand, is free and
independent. It prevents people from indulging in sense pleasure,
safeguards a safe engagement with sense pleasure, and averts the
suffering arising due to the change inherent in conditioned things.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Because sense pleasure depends on external sense objects –
sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles – those people who
indulge in sense pleasure effectively entrust their happiness, along
with their entire fate, to these things. These external things are
subject to myriad causes and conditions, which people have no control
over. For this reason those people who entrust their happiness to these
unreliable things open themselves up to disappointment and various
difficulties. The more one fails to understand this dynamic, the greater
is one’s suffering.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Life tied up with sense pleasure revolves entirely around contact
with the outside world, around contact between sense faculties and sense
objects; this is an external, superficial dimension of life. Moreover,
the endless search for sense pleasure is tiring and tedious. Internal,
refined forms of happiness help to free people from this cycle of sense
contact; they free people from an excessive reliance on the sense
faculties. At the very least, they offer people a respite and rest, and
introduce them to more profound aspects of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Because sense pleasure relies on external things, it requires
sense objects to pass through the various sense bases in order to supply
fuel for craving. If one does not obtain these desired things as fuel,
one suffers. Internal, refined forms of happiness, however, do not rely
on external things. Those people who are endowed with such happiness,
although deprived of gratifying sense objects, still abide happily.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because of this reliance on external things, those persons
indulging in sense pleasure are unable to dwell unoccupied. If they are
idle, they feels restless and feverish for things to experience. This
restlessness and fever are true expressions of suffering. People who
suffer this yearning and fever tend to deceive themselves by overlooking
and ignoring this situation and instead focus exclusively on whatever
gratification they have been able to acquire.</p>
<p>In addition, when people have found gratification, even if this involves
highly agreeable objects, they are unable to enjoy this experience for
long. If the experience becomes too prolonged, it becomes a form of
endurance and the happiness transforms into suffering. Sense pleasure
thus relies on a continual change and variation of sense objects, and
for this reason the scriptures state that movement (<em>iriyāpatha</em>)
conceals suffering.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn50">50</a></sup> Those who have accessed more refined forms of
happiness are not tormented by the fever of yearning. They are able to
abide in a particular state of happiness for long periods of time,
according to their wishes, as illustrated in the story of the Buddha and
King Bimbisāra (see below). {1055}</p>
<p><strong>E.</strong> Sense pleasure is shaped by and subject to craving, that is, it
is related to one’s habitually accumulated likes and dislikes,
preferences and aversions. These likes and dislikes can fluctuate and
are erratic. The same object or action may be liked by one person and
disliked by another; one person may see it as a source of pleasure,
another as a source of displeasure.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn51">51</a></sup></p>
<p>This fluctuation is true even for a single individual – on one occasion
one sees or hears something and is pleased, while on another occasion
the same thing causes displeasure. And in the case that two people
encounter the same object and both like it, this may lead to mutual
aversion, since they both desire the same thing. These situations can
cause conflict within an individual and animosity between people. They
are the source of all sorts of trouble and affliction.</p>
<p>Sense pleasure or material happiness is thus the opposite to internal,
non-material happiness, which is available on any occasion. This latter
happiness is invariably a boon; it bestows a sense of wellbeing and
contentment to the person experiencing it and it is beneficial to
everyone who is involved. The greater the number of people who
experience it the better. Each individual enhances the happiness of
others, because there is nothing to vie for. It therefore leads to peace
and to the end of problems.</p>
<p><strong>F.</strong> Sense pleasure is the result of the gratification of craving
(<em>taṇhā</em>). If craving arises but is left unsatisfied and unappeased,
problems arise immediately. These problems, or this state of
dissatisfaction, is referred to as ’suffering’ (<em>dukkha</em>). Suffering
leaves harmful effects in its wake. These harmful effects either get
locked up within an individual or the person vents them outwards, or
both.</p>
<p>The harmful effects locked up inside refer to anxiety, despair, and
other forms of mental distress. They can be collectively referred to as
mental derangement or even as madness.</p>
<p>The harmful effects seeking an expression outwards may be given vent in
a mild way, say by seeking out different forms of guidance and help. One
may seek out guidance in ways that accord with wisdom and virtue, or one
may seek help from sacred objects and supernatural powers. Some people
try to cover over their suffering by indulging in coarse or increasingly
passionate forms of sense pleasure. The harmful effects can also be
expressed in violent ways, say by causing conflict and persecuting
others or by causing destruction to one’s environment. Alternatively,
one may breed self-hatred and undergo severe austerities or cause injury
to oneself.</p>
<p>The following words by the Buddha are relevant here:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And what, monks, is the source and origin of suffering? Craving is its
source and origin (<em>nidāna-sambhava</em>).</p>
<p>And what is the result of suffering?…. Suffering, I say, results
either in mental derangement or in an outward search for relief.
{1056}</p>
<p><em>A. III. 415-6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The search for happiness through the gratification of craving causes
problems at all stages, not only when one is denied gratification.
Problems may also arise during the search for pleasing objects and after
one has acquired such objects. While searching for objects one may
injure or exploit others, causing them suffering and affliction. And
after one has acquired the desired objects, one may become infatuated by
them, increasing one’s thirst and craving, thus causing additional
problems. For this reason conscientious unawakened people must use
discernment and apply virtuous qualities to guide their behaviour, in
order to mitigate the hazards of craving.</p>
<p>One very useful method for safely enjoying sense pleasures is for people
to have some access to non-material happiness, which acts as an escape
(<em>nissaraṇa</em>). This escape is very effective for refining one’s
behaviour generated by craving, or it helps to keep this behaviour
within wholesome boundaries. Happiness independent of material things
stands in direct contrast to craving; it manifests when one is released
from craving and it exists without relying on craving. Anyone who dwells
in this kind of happiness is immediately freed from the perils of
craving.</p>
<p>Because sense pleasure is flawed, can cause a great deal of harm, and is
both cherished by and compelling for people, it need not be promoted.
Therefore, the Buddha did not support the pursuit of sense pleasure and
he discouraged people from setting it as the goal of life.</p>
<p>In Buddhism, the essential aim of performing wholesome deeds or making
merit – whether this be through generosity (<em>dāna</em>), moral conduct
(<em>sīla</em>), or cultivating the mind (<em>bhāvanā</em>) – is not to receive a
reward in the form of sense pleasure, say of wealth, fame, respect, an
entourage of followers, or rebirth in a heavenly realm. The true purpose
of wholesome actions is to support spiritual development and to access
true, lasting happiness, which leads to a reduction of mental
defilement, a disengagement from evil, and an elimination of craving –
the source of suffering. The person engaging in good actions thus
experiences deeper, more refined forms of happiness – up to the
happiness of Nibbāna – which bring peace and wellbeing to the
individual and to society:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Not for happiness tarnished by defilement, not for future birth, does
a sage give gifts. Indeed, a sage gives gifts for the end of
defilement, for the absence of future birth.</p>
<p>Not for happiness tarnished by defilement, not for future birth, does
a sage develop the jhānas. Indeed, a sage develops the jhānas for the
end of defilement, for the absence of future birth.</p>
<p>Aiming for the state of peace (i.e. Nibbāna), inclining in this
direction, devoted to this state, a sage gifts gifts. Sages set
Nibbāna as the goal, just as rivers head for the heart of the ocean.
{1057}</p>
<p><em>Nd. I. 424-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h2 id="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-happiness"><a class="header" href="#advantages-and-disadvantages-of-happiness">Advantages and Disadvantages of Happiness</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Buddha examined the advantages and
disadvantages of all things. In the case that something still possesses
both advantages and disadvantages, he would then describe how one may
pass beyond them, that is, he would explain how further development is
possible.</p>
<p>Looking at things in this way enables a continual development. When one
reaches a particular point, one acknowledges both its advantages
(<em>assāda</em>) and disadvantages (<em>ādīnava</em>). One then looks for the way out
(<em>nissaraṇa</em>) leading to the next stage and one develops the necessary
conditions to move on. In whatever work or activity one is engaged, the
examination of these three factors leads to ongoing development. One
does not get lost in thinking that one has reached completion; one does
not stop making effort and become passive, negligent, and heedless,
which results in missed opportunities.</p>
<p>Let us now look at the advantages and disadvantages of happiness. Rather
than go into a detailed analysis of the many different kinds and stages
of happiness, here the discussion will focus on some primary features of
happiness that are related to other spiritual qualities and that pertain
to people’s everyday life.</p>
<p>One such spiritual quality, which is relevant to everyone and is
connected to meditation, to spiritual practice, and to every aspect of
learning, is concentration (<em>samādhi</em>). Happiness is expressly valuable
to concentration. The Pali Canon states: <em>sukhapadaṭṭhāno samādhi</em>:
happiness is a basis and criterion for concentration; it is a proximate
cause for concentration.</p>
<p>The literal meaning of <em>sukha</em> (’happiness’) is ’convenient’ or ’easy’.
One is free from pressure, obstruction, affliction, struggle, agitation,
and anxiety. In other words, one is peaceful; happiness leads to peace.
When the mind is peaceful, concentration arises easily. A happy and
tranquil mind is prepared for concentration.</p>
<p>Happiness is a characteristic of a high quality of life. Arahants, for
example, when they are not engaged in a specific activity, dwell in the
state of mind referred to as ’abiding at ease in the present’
(<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>), which is most often a state of jhāna.</p>
<p>There are many disadvantages of happiness. In particular, happiness may
lead to carelessness, infatuation, obsession, indulgence,
procrastination, indifference, or laziness. {1127} Concentration, which
is based on happiness, has similar disadvantages. In Pali, concentration
is sometimes referred to as belonging to the ’same faction as laziness’
(<em>kosajja-pakkha</em>).</p>
<p>At the same time, however, concentration belongs to the thirty-seven
factors of enlightenment (<em>bodhipakkhiya-dhamma</em>): concentration is
directly associated with awakening; it lies ’alongside’ awakening.
Awakening is dependent on concentration.</p>
<p>Here, simply note that concentration is a factor of enlightenment, but
that it is also associated with laziness. When one examines spiritual
qualities, do not only look at their advantages; also acknowledge their
disadvantages. Be careful – if one develops concentration incorrectly,
one will give rise to laziness.</p>
<p>The Buddha in this case encouraged the application of mindfulness, for
inspection and caution. When one attains concentration, one asks: ’Has
this concentration deviated towards idleness and inertia? Has it become
an impediment?’ The heedless indulgence in the pleasure of concentration
is harmful. One must be careful and know how to apply concentration. Do
not fall into heedlessness.</p>
<p>When people experience happiness, especially sense pleasure, it is very
likely that they will become carried away, infatuated, and enchanted by
it, resulting in heedlessness. When experiencing happiness, they lose a
sense of urgency and do not wish to do anything else. Although there
remain things to be done, they become negligent, indifferent, and
indolent, resulting in a weak character.</p>
<p>For this reason, those people who have experienced happiness and yet
remain unmindful, who are indulgent, apathetic, and heedless, become
weak and corrupted. They may even meet with calamity and ruin. Many
individuals, communities, nations, and even civilizations throughout
history have fallen into this cycle of decline.</p>
<p>When looking at these disadvantages, it may appear that happiness is of
very low value. But happiness is simply happiness; it is the corrupted
and defiled human beings themselves who deal with happiness incorrectly
and thus end up experiencing harmful effects.</p>
<p>Here, we must return to the subject of sense pleasure, which has a
bearing on almost everyone’s life. Although we have discussed sense
pleasure already, here we will focus on it directly in relation to
spiritual practice.</p>
<p>The dangers or disadvantages of sense pleasure – of happiness dependent
on material things and serving personal gratification – are extensive,
and people thus require the supervision or protection by way of the five
precepts. This points to a basic drawback or weakness of sense pleasure:
it is a cause for competition and exploitation among human beings.</p>
<p>The things providing gratification are external, and they are
insufficient in number to fulfil the desires of everyone. Because each
person desires things for himself, and wishes to obtain the maximum
amount of these things, they see each other as adversaries. People thus
conflict and compete with one another. This is followed by deception,
dishonesty, and deceit, a search for followers and a pursuit of power,
and various forms of persecution and abuse.</p>
<p>The pursuit of sense pleasure is the source of conflict and oppression
between people and between nations. It is the source of war, leading to
all kinds of suffering and affliction. People then search without end
for a solution: their voices call for peace, but their hands brandish
swords. This is the first danger of sense pleasure. {1128}</p>
<p>Social oppression, which spreads suffering outwards, has its root in the
mind, i.e. an insatiable desire, which is a common characteristic of
craving (<em>taṇhā</em>). Moreover, this insatiability, which conforms to a
voracious hunger for things and an inability to feel one has enough,
creates suffering within an individual.</p>
<p>The more people get, the more they want. A specific degree or amount of
things that once provided happiness is eventually no longer
satisfactory. The feeling of joy and excitement is replaced by
indifference, apathy, and a sense of ennui. Once boredom sets in, those
things that at one time seemed indispensable now must simply be endured.
Those things that once provided happiness are now a cause for suffering.
The nature of desire has changed; now one may wish for the object to go
away, to disappear. This is one form of affliction.</p>
<p>At one time one may have been penniless. If one obtains $30 one is over
the moon, and when one earns a wage of $30 a day one is exceedingly
happy. Eventually one wishes to earn $3000 a day. One imagines that
with such a wage all of one’s desires will be fulfilled and one will
experience delight. Indeed, if it happens that one earns such a wage, at
first one is blissful and content.</p>
<p>A closer look at this dynamic reveals the gradual expansion of craving
in two ways:</p>
<p>First, when one obtains a regular wage of $3000 per day, if one day one
only obtains $30, an amount that had at one time provided a great sense
of joy, one is unhappy. The same thing that once provided happiness now
causes suffering.</p>
<p>Second, although one may have been convinced that by earning a wage of
$3000 per day one wouldn’t wish for anything more, eventually one feels
apathy and boredom. One then thinks that one needs to earn a wage of
$30,000 per day in order to feel satisfied. This target will increase
without end.</p>
<p>The Buddha stated that even if one were to turn a mountain into gold, it
would still not gratify the desire of one individual, because this
desire is insatiable, as mentioned above. The Buddha emphasized this
subject repeatedly, so that his disciples would recognize that human
desire is limitless; craving is endless. This desire creates oppression
and affliction in society, and it also creates layers of suffering
within an individual. One aspect to this suffering is the feeling of
boredom and apathy.</p>
<h2 id="nature-provides-happiness"><a class="header" href="#nature-provides-happiness">Nature Provides Happiness</a></h2>
<p>Let us examine some of the different kinds of happiness. So far the
discussion has covered the happiness derived from sense enjoyment, from
contact with desirable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangible
objects. This is a matter connected with the gratification of craving
(<em>taṇhā</em>), with sense pleasure (<em>kāma-sukha</em>), and with material
happiness (<em>sāmisa-sukha</em>). We also discussed wholesome desire
(<em>chanda</em>), which is associated with spiritual development, and leads to
study, creativity, understanding, and an increase in happiness.</p>
<p>In terms of wholesome desire, it was mentioned earlier how a person
experiences happiness both while engaged in work and while engaged in
learning. There are more aspects, however, to this discussion of
happiness derived from wholesome desire.</p>
<p>This increased happiness includes happiness on a social level: the joy
of friendship; the joy of living with others with a heart of kindness
and compassion; and the joy in families and communities of living
together with mutual goodwill, care, and love, of rejoicing in harmony,
and of being united in the virtues conducive to communal life
(<em>sārāṇīya-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn52">52</a></sup> {1094}</p>
<p>There is also the happiness related to nature: the joy of living in
nature; the contact with the peace and beauty of nature, including the
trees, the wind, mountains, bodies of water, and the sky; the delight
one experiences in flowering plants and in the sounds of the wilderness,
for instance the calls of birds, the cries of wild animals, and the
rumble of thundering skies.</p>
<p>Both the happiness in relation to society and the happiness in relation
to nature are emphasized and praised in Buddhism. They are sometimes
combined in a single teaching, of living together with kindness and in
harmony even while residing in the forest, as is documented in the
Gosiṅgasāla Sutta:</p>
<p>The Buddha went to visit three monks in the Gosiṅgasāla wood. He asked
them:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>How, Anuruddha, do you live in concord, with mutual appreciation,
without disputing, blending like milk and water, viewing each other
with kindly eyes?</p>
<p><em>M. I. 206.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In that same wood, on another occasion, Ven. Sāriputta asked the
following question from other great disciples:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood is delightful, the night is clear and
bright, the sāla trees are all in blossom, giving forth fragrant
scents in all directions, similar to the scents of heaven. What kind
of bhikkhu, friend … could grace the Gosiṅga Sāla-tree Wood?</p>
<p><em>M. I. 212-13.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>There are numerous poetic verses in the Tipiṭaka eulogizing nature. Take
for example the following verses from the Mahāvessantara Jātaka:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Near those lotus ponds, flocks of cuckoos drunk on fruit call out
captivating, melodious cries, filling the forest with reverberating
sound. When the bushes bloom in season, a sweetness like honey drips
from the blossoms, resting on the lotus leaves….</p>
<p>The breeze wafts myriad fragrances, drifting through the forest, as if
inviting visitors to find delight in the perfumed flowers and
branches. Swarms of bumblebees relish the scent of the blossoms, their
buzzing echoing throughout.</p>
<p><em>J. VI. 530.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>When Ven. Kāḷudāyī invited the Buddha to travel to Kapilavatthu in order
to visit his father, he spoke approximately sixty verses praising the
beauty of nature found in the regions along the path to be travelled. In
the end, the Buddha accepted the invitation.</p>
<p>Here are two of these verses:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Fanned by breezes, the champaka trees, orchids, and laurel send out
their fragrance. The crown of the trees, filled with blossoms, send
down their colourful branches, as if thoughtfully extending their arms
and paying respects with their scent. Venerable sir, the Victorious
One, now is the right time to go.</p>
<p>Splendid parakeets and magpies, with sweet-sounding voices, fly and
throng among the treetops, twittering and calling out on both sides of
the path. Now is the time for the Lord to see his father. {1095}</p>
<p><em>ApA. 532-7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In sum, the Buddha and the arahants, whose hearts are purified, find
delight in the peace and beauty of nature, and abide happily in natural
surroundings. Trainees (<em>sekha</em>) and unawakened persons find in nature a
tranquil and refreshing environment, conducive to meditation and the
development of wisdom.</p>
<p>In reference to the development of ethics, one can see here how virtue
is developed along with happiness, how happiness is an important part of
developing one’s life, and how people are able to generate happiness
within themselves. Wholesome desire is the catalyst behind this
development, and an education or training based on such desire
automatically helps to cultivate a strong ethical foundation.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the supreme happiness – the happiness of wisdom –
which belongs to the stage of independent happiness.</p>
<p>Wisdom is a liberating factor. If one faces a stumbling block or
obstruction, and one doesn’t know how to respond, the situation is
immediately clarified and resolved with the dawn of wisdom. When faced
with confusion, not knowing which way to turn and where safety lies, the
heart feels oppressed and stifled. But with the arising of wise
understanding, the sense of oppression and affliction disappears. When
encountering a problem and no solution is apparent, one may suffer
greatly, but when wisdom provides an answer one is freed from suffering.
Wisdom gradually provides freedom on many levels of one’s life. When one
is able to untangle the nexus of suffering, one reaches final and
complete liberation, which is also perfect happiness.</p>
<h2 id="higher-forms-of-happiness"><a class="header" href="#higher-forms-of-happiness">Higher Forms of Happiness</a></h2>
<h3 id="timeless-happiness"><a class="header" href="#timeless-happiness">Timeless Happiness</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, a definition for happiness is the fulfilment of
desire, yet this definition is not comprehensive. Technically speaking,
this definition covers only mundane (<em>lokiya</em>) reality. A supreme,
transcendent (<em>lokuttara</em>) form of happiness also exists. To some, this
explanation may appear abstruse. To clarify this matter it is useful to
illustrate the different levels of happiness. Earlier, happiness was
divided according to two distinct kinds of desire, but here it necessary
to introduce the concept of ’non-desire’.</p>
<p>This new classification results in two main levels of happiness, and
three sublevels: {1098}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Happiness as the fulfilment of desire:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Happiness as the gratification of craving – <em>taṇhā</em> (the
fulfilment of unwholesome desire).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness as the fulfilment of wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness independent of the fulfilment of desire (= (C)
ever-present happiness).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The second main kind of happiness is independent of both the fulfilment
of craving and the fulfilment of wholesome desire. It is independent,
unconstrained, and free because it is an internal attribute, it exists
inherent in people’s hearts, and it is ever-present. It is not dependent
on obtaining or doing anything.</p>
<p>If one needs to satisfy the needs of some form of desire in order to
experience happiness, this indicates that the happiness is not yet
present. One must then wait for fulfilment, by pursuing or creating
something. An independent kind of happiness, however, already exists
within a person; therefore, it is free from the gratification of desire.
It needs neither to be pursued nor to be created.</p>
<p>Here someone may ask the question: ’Are those people endowed with such
happiness free from all desire: free from both craving and from
wholesome desire?’ Indeed, such people are fully endowed with wholesome
desire. Yet their happiness does not rely on the fulfilment or
gratification of this wholesome desire. Although they are replete in
wholesome desire, their happiness is independent of all forms of desire;
they are fully accomplished in the cultivation of happiness.</p>
<p>To reach this accomplishment, one is first brimful of wholesome desire,
and then one transcends even this desire. Take for example the Buddha,
who, as described in one particular passage, was endowed with eighteen
attributes (<em>buddha-dhamma</em>). The relevant attribute here is that he
possessed ’unremitting wholesome enthusiasm’ (<em>natthi chandassa hāni</em>).</p>
<p>We see here the magnitude of the Buddha’s commitment to perform
beneficent deeds, which was prompted by his wholesome enthusiasm in the
form of compassion. The Buddha worked tirelessly after his awakening,
for the remaining forty-five years of his life. He worked day and night,
undergoing many hardships, for the wellbeing of all human beings.</p>
<p>The Buddha and the arahants are filled with wholesome desire, but their
happiness is independent of fulfilling this desire. Their normal,
constant state is one of happiness.</p>
<p>Another way of describing the three levels of happiness is as follows:
{1099}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Happiness requiring a pursuit (happiness gratifying craving).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness created by oneself (happiness fulfilling wholesome
desire).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inherent, ever-present happiness (happiness independent of
fulfilling desire).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first kind of happiness requires a pursuit, because those objects of
enjoyment that satisfy craving are external, material things. They must
be sought after and consumed; one must seize these external things and
have them make contact with one’s senses.</p>
<p>The second kind of happiness is self-generated, because, in order to
fulfil the desire to learn, the desire to know, the desire to study, the
desire to perform a wholesome deed, the appreciation of nature, etc.,
one relies on one’s own dedication and commitment. This happiness can be
created without relying on external things.</p>
<p>The third kind of happiness is ever-present, for when happiness exists
as an internal attribute – as an ordinary and natural state of mind –
then it is constantly present. One need not seek or do anything to
obtain such happiness.</p>
<p>One may wonder how to become a person who is able to enjoy all three
kinds of happiness: the pleasure of seeking sense objects,
self-generated happiness, and abiding, ever-present happiness. Wouldn’t
such a person be proficient? Indeed, stream-enterers are those
individuals able to enjoy these three kinds of happiness.</p>
<p>It turns out that those persons who are truly accomplished in all three
levels of happiness, i.e. the arahants, are fully satisfied by
independent, unconstrained happiness. Although, if they wanted to, they
could enjoy all three kinds of happiness, they are no longer interested
in the first kind of happiness dependent on material objects. This will
be discussed at more length below.</p>
<h3 id="ideal-happiness"><a class="header" href="#ideal-happiness">Ideal Happiness</a></h3>
<p>Happiness can be grouped or classified in many different ways. Let us
examine the Buddha’s classification of happiness into thirteen
pairs.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn53">53</a></sup></p>
<p>Here are some simple examples from this classification:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Physical happiness (<em>kāyika-sukha</em>) and mental happiness
(<em>cetasika-sukha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Material happiness (<em>sāmisa-sukha</em>; happiness dependent on material
things) and independent happiness (<em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>; happiness
independent of material things).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Householders’ happiness (<em>gihi-sukha</em>) and the happiness of
renunciants (<em>pabbajita-sukha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sense pleasure (<em>kāma-sukha</em>; happiness derived from desirable and
alluring sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles; happiness
from acquisition and consumption) and happiness secluded from
sensuality (<em>nekkhamma-sukha</em>; happiness free from sensuality, free
from sensual allurements and enticements; the happiness of
renunciation; happiness not tied up with acquisition.) {1102}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Buddha gave this teaching to distinguish between the many different
kinds of happiness. Moreover, through a familiarity with this teaching
one understands the relationship between different kinds of happiness.</p>
<p>On a related subject, knowledge of the various kinds of happiness
enables one to outline the ideal forms of happiness. Here, a recognition
that happiness is the goal of spiritual training is connected to the
teaching on the different planes of existence (or different states of
mind), which a person can reach through spiritual cultivation.</p>
<p>The universe is traditionally divided into three planes of existence
(<em>tebhūmaka</em>): the realm of sensuality (<em>kāma-bhūmi</em>, where beings are
still tied up in sense pleasure), the realm of fine-material form
(<em>rūpa-bhūmi</em>; the plane of fine-material Brahmas – <em>rūpa-brahma</em>), and
the immaterial realm (<em>arūpa-bhūmi</em>; the plane of immaterial Brahmas –
<em>arūpa-brahma</em>). Another plane – the transcendent plane
(<em>lokuttara-bhūmi</em>) – exists surpassing the threefold plane of
existence.</p>
<p>In relation to the threefold plane of existence, the term <em>bhūmi</em> refers
to a specific ’world’ (<em>loka</em>) or sphere of existence occupied by beings
native to that plane or realm. Alternatively, it refers to the
particular state of mind developed by beings to reach such a plane.</p>
<p>This second definition, referring to one’s state of mind, can also be
applied in relation to the transcendent plane. What this means is that a
percentage of beings dwelling in a specific plane of existence, in
particular some human beings in this world, may have developed various
states of mind, and in effect have reached various planes, including the
transcendent plane.</p>
<p>These planes (<em>bhūmi</em>) can be grouped as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sensual plane (<em>kāma-bhūmi</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fine-material form plane (<em>rūpa-bhūmi</em>) and the immaterial plane
(<em>arūpa-bhūmi</em>); these constitute the realm of the Brahma gods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transcendent plane (<em>lokuttara-bhūmi</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In relation to happiness, these three planes can be described thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sensual plane, endowed with sense pleasure (<em>kāma-sukha</em>): the ideal
is to be a divine being (<em>deva</em>) or to be born in heaven (<em>sagga</em>);
here, one has developed oneself and reached the supreme kind of
sense pleasure. Although one is still endowed with the suffering
(<em>dukkha</em>) of unawakened beings, one is free from oppression and
punishment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brahma plane, endowed with the happiness of jhāna (<em>jhāna-sukha</em>):
here, the ideal is to be born as a Brahma god.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transcendent plane, endowed with the happiness of Nibbāna
(<em>nibbāna-sukha</em>): here, the ideal is the fruit of arahantship.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Buddhism is a system of training for the spiritual development of human
beings. It follows the principle that every individual should
continually cultivate him- or herself and reach more refined forms of
happiness. Moreover, at any one time different people exist at different
stages of development. For this reason, the world should be a conducive
place for each individual to make progress, according to which stage he
or she is at.</p>
<p>Setting happiness to be the goal of spiritual training, human beings
should develop themselves in the three planes mentioned above, in order
to reach successively more refined levels of happiness.</p>
<p>Through moral training one develops physical actions in order to create
a beneficial relationship to one’s environment, and one cultivates
morality in order to support others and to live together happily. In
short, by developing generosity and virtuous conduct one attains the
delights of heaven. {1103}</p>
<p>Through mental training, while abiding in such a conducive environment,
one develops the mind in virtuous qualities, in particular the four
divine abidings (<em>brahmavihāra</em>). Established in concentration, one’s
mind is steady, poised, and happy. One develops happiness of mind until
one reaches the happiness of jhāna.</p>
<p>Through wisdom training, by relying on the accomplishments of mind
development, one cultivates wisdom and insight. One sees things clearly
according to the truth; one discerns conditionality; one knows how to
successfully reach the goal; one is able to solve problems and dispel
suffering; and one frees the mind and reaches the happiness of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Heavenly beings amuse themselves with sensual objects and activities.
Brahma gods are satisfied by a refined happiness of mind, including the
happiness of jhāna. Arahants, having transcended the bonds of sense
pleasure, fully realize the happiness of Nibbāna. Stream-enterers access
the happiness of all three planes – of sense pleasure, happiness of the
higher mind (<em>adhicitta-sukha</em>), and transcendent happiness
(<em>lokuttara-sukha</em>) – having not yet abandoned any of these.</p>
<h3 id="supreme-happiness-of-the-buddha"><a class="header" href="#supreme-happiness-of-the-buddha">Supreme Happiness of the Buddha</a></h3>
<p>The Buddha asserted that he had realized a happiness surpassing the
happiness of a great monarch, whose happiness is considered by most
ordinary people as being supreme.</p>
<p>On one occasion the Buddha met with members of the Nigaṇṭhā order who
were practising various forms of asceticism and self-mortification, and
he spoke with them about the religious practices they undertook for
reaching their desired goal.</p>
<p>The Nigaṇṭhā followers practised severe austerities because they
believed that happiness cannot be achieved by way of happiness; it can
only be achieved by way of pain. In order to support this belief they
compared King Bimbisāra with the Buddha, saying that if one were able to
achieve (supreme) happiness – the highest goal of religious practice –
by way of pleasure, then King Bimbisāra would surely have attained this
achievement, since his happiness and comfort exceeds that of the Buddha.</p>
<p>The Nigaṇṭhā said this because they held the common belief that, since
King Bimbisāra possesses lavish wealth and great power, his ease and
comfort must be greater than the Buddha’s, who had relinquished his
worldly possessions, wandered about in remote mountains and forests, and
observed various religious practices; surely the Buddha suffered similar
pain and difficulty as the Nigaṇṭhā themselves.</p>
<p>The Buddha, however, rejected their claim and proved their premise false
by saying that King Bimbisāra does not have more happiness than the
Buddha. On the contrary, the Buddha experiences greater happiness than
the king. {1034}</p>
<p>From the perspective of ordinary people it was difficult to judge
whether the Buddha had more happiness than King Bimbisāra, because most
people, including the Nigaṇṭhā in this story, take as a measurement
abundance at the external level, for example the amount of one’s wealth,
power, prestige, personal retinue, etc., all of which the Buddha had
relinquished. In fact, it is impossible to use such external things as a
gauge for someone’s true, internal happiness, and therefore the Buddha
did not submit these things as proof.</p>
<p>Indeed, measuring a person’s internal happiness, which is invisible, is
difficult to do. The Buddha thus used other criteria, which are clearly
discernible to others, as a decisive way to determine a person’s
internal happiness. He did this by asking whether King Bimbisāra would
be able to sit still for seven days – or even one day – without moving
or speaking and experience uninterrupted happiness. The answer was ’no’.
The Buddha went on to say that he himself is able to sit still and
experience such uninterrupted happiness for two, three, even seven days.
The Nigaṇṭhā thus conceded that the Buddha has more happiness than King
Bimbisāra.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn54">54</a></sup></p>
<p>The Buddha compared the pleasure derived from the five sense objects to
a fire made from straw and twigs. Although it is bright, it is not
resplendent because it is clouded by smoke. The happiness and bliss
independent of material sense objects and free from unwholesome states,
on the other hand, is like a fire burning without using grass and twigs
as fuel. Its light is pure and brilliant, devoid of any stain.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn55">55</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="path-to-supreme-happiness"><a class="header" href="#path-to-supreme-happiness">Path to Supreme Happiness</a></h2>
<h3 id="developing-more-refined-forms-of-happiness"><a class="header" href="#developing-more-refined-forms-of-happiness">Developing More Refined Forms of Happiness</a></h3>
<p>Before describing more refined forms of happiness, it is helpful here to
describe a basic form of happiness (<em>sukha</em>) and suffering (<em>dukkha</em>),
that has a bearing on all other forms of happiness. The following
definition was given by Ven. Sāriputta after he was asked by a wandering
ascetic the following question:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>’Friend Sāriputta, what is happiness in this Dhamma and Discipline,
and what is suffering?’</p>
<p>’Dissatisfaction, friend, is suffering in this Dhamma and Discipline.
Satisfaction is happiness.</p>
<p>’When there is dissatisfaction (<em>anabhirati</em>), friend, this suffering
is to be expected: when walking, one does not find happiness or
contentment, when standing still … when sitting … when lying down
… when in a village … when in the forest … when at the foot of a
tree … when in an empty hut … when in the open air … when among
a group of monks, one does not find happiness or contentment. When
there is dissatisfaction, this suffering is to be expected.</p>
<p>’[But] when there is satisfaction (<em>abhirati</em>), this happiness is to
be expected: when walking, one finds happiness and contentment, when
standing still … when sitting … when lying down … when in a
village … when in the forest … when at the foot of a tree … when
in an empty hut … when in the open air … when among a group of
monks, one finds happiness and contentment. When there is
satisfaction, this happiness is to be expected.’</p>
<p><em>A. V. 121-2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Following is a list of analogies for the happiness inherent in the
various stages of meditative absorption (<em>jhāna</em>). The last step before
the attainment of jhāna is the abandonment of the five hindrances
(<em>nīvaraṇa</em>): sensual desire (<em>kāma-chanda</em>), ill-will (<em>byāpāda</em>),
sloth and torpor (<em>thīna-middha</em>), restlessness and worry
(<em>uddhacca-kukkucca</em>), and doubt (<em>vicikicchā</em>). When one abandons the
five hindrances one experiences peace and contentment, which is the
basis for experiencing the happiness of jhāna. There are five similes
for this initial peace and contentment:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Similar to the joy and delight of a person who has borrowed money
from a creditor, achieved success in his work, and paid off his
debts, with money to spare for supporting his family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to the joy and delight of a person who has recovered from a
serious illness, and regains his appetite and physical strength.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to the joy and delight of a person who has been released
from imprisonment, is able to travel about freely, and does not
incur a fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to the joy and delight of a person who has been emancipated
from slavery, gains freedom and independence, and is able to move
about as he pleases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to the joy and delight of a wealthy person who has carried
his wealth across a long, dangerous, and remote area and arrived
safely at his destination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From here one experiences the increasingly refined forms of happiness
inherent in the four (fine-material) jhānas:</p>
<p>In the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied attention
(<em>vitakka</em>), sustained attention (<em>vicāra</em>), bliss (<em>pīti</em>), joy
(<em>sukha</em>), and one-pointedness (<em>ekaggatā</em>), a practitioner’s body is
permeated and suffused with bliss and joy; no part of the body is left
untouched by this bliss and joy. This is similar to someone who in the
morning sprinkles water on bath powder contained in a bronze basin. By
evening the moisture has pervaded it inside and out so that none of the
powder is dispersed. {1047}</p>
<p>In the second jhāna, which is accompanied by bliss, joy, and
one-pointedness, a practitioner’s body is thoroughly permeated and
suffused with the bliss and happiness born of concentration. This is
similar to a deep lake whose waters spring entirely from below, with no
other inflow including rainfall from above. The cool fount of water
welling up would drench, steep, and pervade every part of the lake.</p>
<p>In the third jhāna, which is accompanied by joy and one-pointedness, a
practitioner’s body is thoroughly permeated and suffused with joy
divested of bliss. This is similar to a lotus plant growing in the
water, immersed in water, and nourished by water. The cool water
drenches, steeps, and pervades every part of the plant, from its tip to
its roots.</p>
<p>In the fourth jhāna, which is accompanied by equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>) and
one-pointedness, a practitioner pervades the entire body with a pure
bright mind. This is similar to a person who is completely covered from
the head down with an immaculate white cloth.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>Following on from the happiness of the four fine-material jhānas is the
happiness of the four formless jhānas, which similarly becomes
increasingly more refined.</p>
<p>Although the happiness of jhāna is superior and more profound than sense
pleasure, it has defects and flaws; it is not yet perfect happiness.</p>
<p>The Buddha stated that in the noble discipline (<em>ariya-vinaya</em>) the five
strands of sensual pleasure (<em>kāma-guṇa</em>) are called the ’world’
(<em>loka</em>); in other words, the ’world’ is equivalent to the five sense
pleasures. One who is attached to sense pleasure is still bound up in
the world. One who has attained fine-material jhāna or formless jhāna,
is described as one who has reached and dwells in the zenith or limit of
the world. He or she is still connected to the world, however, and has
not yet escaped or transcended it.</p>
<p>A person who passes beyond the last formless jhāna, who attains the
cessation of perception and feeling (<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>), and is
free from the mental taints through discerning the truth with wisdom, is
described as one who has reached the end of the world and has
transcended the bonds that bind beings to the world.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>The ultimate and complete form of happiness belongs to someone whose
mind is liberated – the happiness of one who has realized Nibbāna. This
happiness includes the happiness associated with the cessation of
perception and feeling, which is the tenth kind of happiness mentioned
in the list above (see the earlier section on diverse grades of
happiness).</p>
<p>The most notable defects of the happiness of jhāna are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The happiness of jhāna is still not completely free; it is still
restricted and constrained by perception and other mental factors
present in jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn58">58</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a specific state of jhāna, it is still possible for mental
application connected to perceptions of inferior states of jhāna to
well up in the mind; the happiness of jhāna is thus still prone to
disturbance or agitation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn59">59</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although the happiness of jhāna is a form of non-material happiness,
it is still subject to attachment and it may give rise to grasping
(<em>upādāna</em>). It can be an impediment for realizing Nibbāna and
perfect happiness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn60">60</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is inadequate; it must be transcended or abandoned.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn61">61</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a conditioned phenomenon; it is fashioned by other mental
causes and conditions; it is unstable, its very nature is subject to
decline and cessation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn62">62</a></sup> {1048}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another important attribute of the happiness of jhāna is that exists on
the level of feeling or sensation (<em>vedanā</em>). It arises as a result of
cognizing sense objects or of experiencing the pleasure of sense
objects.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn63">63</a></sup> From this perspective, the happiness of jhāna shares some
attributes with sense pleasure, i.e. it is a form of pleasurable
sensation (<em>sukha-vedanā</em>). For this reason, the first nine forms of
happiness can all be classified as happiness dependent on the cognition
of sense objects.</p>
<h3 id="happiness-beyond-sensation"><a class="header" href="#happiness-beyond-sensation">Happiness Beyond Sensation</a></h3>
<p>The distinctive form of happiness is the tenth and final form, which,
although it is classified as happiness (<em>sukha</em>), is not a sensation
(<em>vedanā</em>) nor does it require the enjoyment of sense objects. It can
thus be called ’happiness beyond sensation’. It refers to the happiness
associated with the cessation of perception and feeling
(<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>), a concentrative state in which, as the name
implies, is free of feeling or sensation.</p>
<p>Some people may question how it can be a form of happiness if there is
no sensation, because <em>sukha</em> is technically one form of <em>vedanā</em>. But
as confirmed by these words of the Buddha, there is a happiness that is
not a sensation:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Here, Ānanda, by completely transcending the base of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception, a monk enters and dwells in the
cessation of perception and feeling. This is that other kind of
happiness more excellent and sublime than the previous kind of
happiness [of the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception].</p>
<p>Now it is possible that wanderers of other sects might speak thus:
’The ascetic Gotama speaks of the cessation of perception and feeling,
and he maintains that it is included in happiness. What is that? How
is that?’ When wanderers of other sects speak thus, they should be
told: ’The Blessed One, friends, does not describe a state as included
in happiness only with reference to pleasant feeling. But rather,
friends, wherever happiness is found and in whatever way, the
Tathāgata describes that state as included in happiness.’</p>
<p><em>M. I. 400; S. IV. 228; cf.: MA. III. 115; SA. III. 80.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The cessation of perception and feeling (<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>) is
comparable to Nibbāna, and the happiness independent of the enjoyment of
sense objects – or happiness free from sensation – in this state is
similar to the happiness of Nibbāna (<em>nibbāna-sukha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn64">64</a></sup></p>
<p>Ven. Sāriputta explains this matter in the Nibbāna Sutta, beginning with
the statement: <em>Friends, this Nibbāna is happiness, this Nibbāna is
happiness.</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn65">65</a></sup> Ven. Udāyī asks him how it is possible to have
happiness in a state devoid of an enjoyment of sense objects. Sāriputta
replies that Nibbāna, in which there is no enjoyment of sense objects
(i.e. there is no sensation – <em>vedanā</em>), is itself happiness. He then
goes on to explain in an indirect way by using the various states of
concentrative attainment as a comparison. Here he does not simply
compare Nibbāna to the cessation of perception and feeling, but he
describes the comparable aspects of each jhāna, beginning with the first
jhāna, as a way of explaining the happiness of Nibbāna. {1049}</p>
<p>In each level of jhāna it is possible for ’mental application
accompanied by perception’ (<em>saññā-manasikāra</em>) associated with the
directly subordinate level of jhāna to well up in the mind. For example,
it is possible that for someone who has attained the third jhāna, which
is divested of bliss and endowed solely with joy and one-pointedness, to
have perceptions of bliss well up.</p>
<p>This mental application accompanied by perception is considered a
disturbance and affliction for the person dwelling in jhāna. (The Pali
term used here for disturbance and affliction is <em>ābādha</em>, which often
denotes ’sickness’ or ’illness’.) It is precisely this disturbance,
affliction, and lack of ease that is referred to as ’suffering’
(<em>dukkha</em>). This is similar to someone who abides happily; the
transition from happiness to unhappiness occurs as a result of some form
of disturbance or agitation.</p>
<p>Someone who is not disturbed by mental application accompanied by
perception is thus fully absorbed in that state of jhāna. Therefore,
even without considering the aspect of sensation, the ordinary, inherent
condition of jhāna is recognized as ’happiness’ (<em>sukha</em>). In other
words, the inherent happiness of jhāna is discernible when one applies
the conditions of disturbance and agitation for comparison.</p>
<p>The spaciousness and ease inherent in each level of jhāna, when there is
no disturbance by mental application accompanied by perception, is an
effective comparison for explaining the happiness of Nibbāna. The
happiness of Nibbāna can thus be described as a state of freedom and
fulfilment, in which there is no disturbance or stress.</p>
<p>Ven. Sāriputta here uses a method of explaining happiness by comparing
it to suffering. A natural state of completeness, free from stress or
agitation, is itself happiness.</p>
<p>Arriving at a freedom from suffering can be described in two ways.
First, one may be oppressed and afflicted by something, or there is a
sense of impairment and deficiency. To rectify this situation one must
escape from the source of oppression or bring an original state of
fulfilment back to completion. Second, one may be provoked, inflamed,
aroused or stimulated. Similar to a sense of impairment and deficiency,
here too one must try and return to an original state of fulfilment.</p>
<p>Ordinary people may refer to this gratification of desire, by rectifying
an abnormal or dissonant situation, as a pursuit of happiness or a
reaping of happiness. In reality, however, what has occurred is that
<em>dukkha</em> (’suffering’, ’stress’) has arisen, and one has alleviated or
stilled this <em>dukkha</em> and returned to a normal state of completeness.</p>
<p>This explanation is consistent with the definition of Nibbāna as a state
free from illness, a state of perfect mental health. The Buddha said
that one may not recognize good health – physical strength and
wellbeing, and an ability to move about unrestricted – as happiness,
because in that moment one is not necessarily enjoying any sense
impressions. But when one compares such health to illness and
affliction, one appreciates the paramount importance of good health. In
other words, when stricken by disease one clearly sees how good health,
or a freedom from illness, is a sublime form of happiness.</p>
<p>Just as an absence of physical illness – a state of complete physical
health and freedom from affliction – is genuine happiness, so too, a
mind free from blemish, from latent anxiety, and from attachment to
sense objects exists in a state of true happiness. It is spacious and
expansive; having realized this happiness, one dwells with a ’boundless
mind’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>The happiness, delight, clarity, and spaciousness of a liberated mind is
the exclusive and exceptional province of awakened beings. It is
difficult for unawakened beings, who have never shared this experience,
to fathom or conceive of it. But they can at least have an intuition
that it is something truly excellent and noble. {1050}</p>
<h3 id="perfect-happiness"><a class="header" href="#perfect-happiness">Perfect Happiness</a></h3>
<p>From the perspective of truth (<em>sabhāva</em>), happiness that is still a
sensation (<em>vedanā</em>), or happiness that is dependent on the enjoyment of
sense objects, is in fact a form of <em>dukkha</em> (’stress’, ’suffering’).
This is because pleasurable sensation (<em>sukha-vedanā</em>) is the same as
other forms of sensation – i.e. painful and neutral sensations
(<em>dukkha-vedanā</em> and <em>adukkhamasukha-vedanā</em>): they are all conditioned
phenomena (<em>saṅkhāra-dhammā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn67">67</a></sup> All conditioned phenomena are
subject to stress (<em>dukkha</em>; this refers to ’dukkha’ in the context of
the Three Characteristics), as illustrated in this discussion between
the Buddha and one of the bhikkhus:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bhikkhu:</em> Venerable sir, while I was alone in seclusion, this
reflection arose in my mind thus: ’The Blessed One has spoken about
three kinds of feeling: pleasant feeling, painful feeling
(dukkha-vedanā), neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling…. But the
Blessed One has also said: ’Whatever sensing (vedanā) of sense objects
is classified as dukkha.’ Now with reference to what was this said by
the Blessed One?</p>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> Good, good, bhikkhu! I have spoken about three kinds of
feeling: pleasant feeling, painful feeling,
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling…. And I have also said:
’Whatever sensing of sense objects is classified as dukkha.’ That
[latter clause] has been stated by me with reference to the
impermanence of formations. That has been stated by me with reference
to formations being subject to destruction … subject to dissolution
… subject to fading away … subject to cessation … subject to
change.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn68">68</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. IV. 216-17.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Whenever one truly understands that the three kinds of feeling are
impermanent, shaped by causes and conditions, interdependent, and of the
nature to decay and cease, and one abandons craving for these feelings,
to the extent where the heart is liberated, one is independent of the
enjoyment of sense objects.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn69">69</a></sup> One experiences supreme happiness,
which is beyond sensation.</p>
<p>Feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) relies on contact (<em>phassa</em>) – on cognition – which
arises from the coming together of a sense base (<em>āyatana</em>), e.g. the
eye, with a sense object (<em>ārammaṇa</em>), e.g. a visual form; as a result
there is ’seeing’, ’hearing’, etc. Feeling is dependent on sense
objects; without sense objects feeling cannot arise. For this reason,
feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) can be defined as ’experiencing sense objects’ or
’enjoying the flavour (<em>rasa</em>) of sense stimuli’.</p>
<p>Therefore, happiness that is a sensation must rely, as does all
sensation, on sense objects. The happiness of jhāna relies exclusively
on ’mind objects’ (<em>dhammārammaṇa</em>). Sense pleasure, however, relies on
all kinds of sense objects, in particular on the first five objects,
which are ’material’ (<em>āmisa</em>) and referred to as the five ’strands of
sense pleasure’ (<em>kāma-guṇa</em>).</p>
<p>Unawakened beings live their lives by searching for sensual happiness,
which is tantamount to entrusting their wellbeing and happiness to
external sense objects. Whenever the five objects of sensual enjoyment
are abundant, they amuse themselves and are cheerful. But whenever these
objects undergo fluctuation and change, or they are in shortage and
unacquirable, these people become discouraged and depressed.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to those individuals who are familiar with more
refined forms of happiness, especially the happiness independent of
sensation; they do not entrust their wellbeing to sense objects. Even if
these things change and disappear they still abide in happiness, as
confirmed by these words by the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Devas and humans take pleasure in forms, delight in forms, rejoice in
forms … rejoice in sounds … rejoice in scents … rejoice in
tastes … rejoice in tactile objects … rejoice in mental phenomena.
{1051}</p>
<p>With the change, fading away, and cessation of forms … sounds …
scents … tastes … tactile objects … mental phenomena, devas and
humans abide in suffering.</p>
<p>But the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Fully Enlightened One, has

<p>The experience of ordinary, unawakened people is limited and confined;
they are familiar only with the happiness arising from sense pleasure.
When they experience a satisfying degree of pleasurable sensations, they
are caught up, infatuated, and beguiled by this pleasure and by the
objects of pleasure. And when they experience painful sensations, they
become downcast or agitated. They yearn for and pin their hopes on the
return of sense pleasure, because they know of no other escape from
painful feelings apart from sense pleasure.</p>
<p>Noble disciples, on the other hand, who are familiar with more refined
forms of happiness, are not caught up and enslaved by sense objects when
experiencing pleasurable sensations. Likewise, when experiencing painful
sensations, they are not dispirited or agitated, nor do they seek out
sense pleasure as an escape. This is because they know of a superior
escape (<em>nissaraṇa</em>) – a freedom independent of sense pleasure. They
know of a more expansive form of happiness and they have insight into
the true nature of happiness and unhappiness. They know of a happiness
free from sensation; they must not always rely on the enjoyment of sense
objects.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn70">70</a></sup></p>
<p>It is difficult for ordinary people to understand this happiness
independent of sensation, because they have no experience of it and know
of nothing comparable to it. Having said this, to get an inkling of it
one can point to a basic form of happiness inherent in people’s minds
which is separate from the happiness derived from enjoying sense
pleasures.</p>
<p>This basic form of happiness is both a happiness in itself and also a
support for the enjoyment of sense objects. It can be described as a
mental state of clarity and calm, when there is no blemish, disturbance,
or lingering anxiety in the mind. It can be called an empty mind, a pure
mind, or a peaceful mind. A person endowed with such a state of mind can
be considered as dwelling in happiness. Moreover, when a person with
such a state of mind experiences sense impressions, whether they be
sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or tangible objects, he or she
experiences the pleasure of this contact to the full.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated by looking at the opposite situation. Take for
example someone eating, whose mind at that time is not calm, who is sad,
depressed, or beset by some other form of distress. Even if the food is
delicious and of the kind that he normally enjoys, on this occasion he
may not find it delicious. He may have to force himself to eat or he may
not be able to swallow the food at all. If, however, his mind is
cheerful, he will savour the flavour of the food fully. Even if the food
is not the best, he may find it delicious.</p>
<p>Another example is someone whose body is dirty, grimy, sweaty, or itchy.
Even if she sits and listens to music she won’t feel at ease, or if she
tries to do some detailed work she won’t be very effective. But if she
takes a shower and cleans her body, she will feel at ease. She will
derive the greatest amount of pleasure from sense contact and be able to
complete meticulous kinds of work. {1052}</p>
<p>Persons endowed with such internal or basic happiness are also able to
enjoy the external happiness derived from sense objects. Besides
benefiting from both kinds of happiness, internal and external, their
mental capabilities are also enhanced. On the contrary, those people who
are deprived of this internal happiness lose out on both counts, both in
terms of internal and external happiness. Moreover, their mental
capabilities are also compromised.</p>
<p>It is possible to cultivate this basic form of happiness and to make it
more pure, prominent, and profound than most people are familiar with.
One can get a sense of the happiness of Nibbāna by way of this
comparison. In sum, Nibbāna is both a form of happiness itself and it
enhances one’s ability to experience happiness.</p>
<p>When people relate properly to sensuality, reduce their infatuation with
pleasurable sense objects, no longer entrust their happiness to these
objects, and stop indulging in sense pleasure, they are prepared to
experience the refined happiness of jhāna. When they have experienced
the happiness of jhāna and yet still wish to enjoy sense pleasure, they
do so in a way characterized as natural and gentle. Generally speaking,
they won’t perform unwholesome deeds for the sake of obtaining sense
pleasure, because they see greater value in the happiness of jhāna. In
addition, the happiness of jhāna relies on a basis of spiritual virtue.</p>
<p>When one experiences the happiness of jhāna, the mind becomes absorbed
in the refined meditative object associated with jhāna, of which there
are many levels of gradually increasing profundity. At the final stage
it is as if one disappears into this state of extreme subtlety (this can
be compared to what people describe as a ’mystical state’). These are
supreme meditative attainments which are difficult to reach. Someone who
is able to relinquish the attachment to this extremely refined state of
absorption in these meditative attainments – who has both uprooted an
attachment to sense pleasure and an attachment to jhāna – who has
indeed relinquished an attachment to all things, reaches perfect
liberation: Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Nibbāna is the opposite of these aforementioned conditions, whether it
be sense pleasure or meditative attainment (<em>jhāna-samāpatti</em>). This is
because the state of sense enjoyment and the state of jhāna both require
an engagement with sense objects, a holding onto sense objects, a
merging with sense objects; one is entrusting oneself and subject to
sense objects. Nibbāna, on the other hand, is a state of detachment,
liberation, and freedom.</p>
<p>Although Nibbāna stands in direct contrast to these other states, a
person who realizes Nibbāna is fully prepared to enjoy all levels of
happiness, including sense pleasure and the happiness of jhāna. They can
enjoy happiness in the most optimum way, without any danger or harm. To
sum up, those people who realize Nibbāna, besides experiencing the
happiness of Nibbāna itself, are able to enjoy all the preceding kinds
of happiness and to savour the enjoyment of these to the fullest.</p>
<p>Those who realize Nibbāna but did not previously pass through the
various stages of concentrative attainment are not qualified to
experience some of these attainments, but they have still reached
Nibbāna and experience the supreme happiness of liberation
(<em>vimutti-sukha</em>). There exists no greater happiness than the happiness
of liberation.</p>
<p>When one abandons sense pleasure, one is entitled to the happiness of
jhāna. When one abandons the happiness of jhāna, one is entitled to the
happiness of Nibbāna and the happiness of liberation, which is secure,
peaceful, and bright, and one is able to return to enjoy all the
previous kinds of happiness. (The fact that awakened beings renounce
sexual intercourse and abandon or disengage from concentrative
attainments – <em>jhāna-samāpatti</em> – enables them to reach superior forms
of spiritual attainments – <em>samāpatti</em>.) In order to reach the freedom
of Nibbāna, one must first relinquish everything, including the bliss of
jhāna. By relinquishing everything, one obtains all. {1053}</p>
<h2 id="review-of-different-forms-of-happiness"><a class="header" href="#review-of-different-forms-of-happiness">Review of Different Forms of Happiness</a></h2>
<p>Here is a summary of the various stages and kinds of happiness:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Vedayita-sukha</em>: happiness as a sensation; happiness involving the
enjoyment of sense objects.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sense pleasure (<em>kāma-sukha</em>): happiness stemming from the five
cords of sensuality (<em>kāma-guṇa</em>); happiness derived from the
five forms of sense contact (<em>phassa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of jhāna (<em>jhāna-sukha</em>): happiness as the fruit of
jhāna:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Happiness associated with the four fine-material jhānas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness associated with the four immaterial jhānas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Avedayita-sukha</em>: happiness that is not a sensation; happiness not
involving contact with sense objects:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Nirodhasamāpatti-sukha</em>: happiness connected to the attainment
of cessation; i.e. dwelling in the cessation of perception and
feeling (<em>saññāvedayita-nirodha</em>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This above classification of happiness accords with the ten stages of
happiness described earlier.</p>
<p>Following is an alternative, threefold classification of happiness,
which is similar to the preceding one yet is slightly more flexible or
non-specific:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn71">71</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sense pleasure (<em>kāma-sukha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of jhāna (<em>jhāna-sukha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of Nibbāna (<em>nibbāna-sukha</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The individuals who experience these three kinds of happiness are as
follows: {1058}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sense pleasure is enjoyed by unawakened human beings and by awakened
beings belonging to the stage of stream-enterers and
once-returners.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn72">72</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of jhāna is accessed by unawakened human beings and by
awakened beings of every stage, from stream-enterers up to arahants,
especially those who have previously developed that specific level
of jhāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn73">73</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of Nibbāna is accessed by awakened beings of every stage,
from stream-enterers up to arahants. (If one is referring to the
happiness of fruition attainment, however, then this is accessible
to those individuals who have reached that specific stage of
awakening. And if one is referring to the happiness of the
’attainment of cessation’ then this is accessible only to
non-returners and arahants who have previously reached the eight
concentrative attainments.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A classification according to different types of individuals appears
this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unawakened human beings enjoy sense pleasure and may experience the
happiness of jhāna.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awakened beings at the stage of stream-entry and once-returning
experience sense pleasure, the happiness of jhāna, and the happiness
of Nibbāna (in the form of happiness of fruition attainment).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awakened beings at the stage of non-returning and arahantship
experience the happiness of jhāna and the happiness of Nibbāna (both
in the form of happiness of fruition attainment, and, if they have
reached the eight concentrative attainments, in the form of
happiness of the attainment of cessation).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Buddhism does not encourage people to act solely for the sake
of obtaining happiness, it constantly acknowledges the truth that
happiness is an essential aspect of human life and gives meaning to
Dhamma practice. One can say that it is an anchor and support for Dhamma
practice. Regardless of whether one is focusing on Dhamma practice in
particular, or on human conduct in general, the happiness meant here is
the basic happiness inherent in people’s minds, which they can contact
by themselves at any time that they are ready. They need not rely on
contact with objects in the outside world. This happiness brings a
degree of independence to one’s life.</p>
<p>The vital importance of happiness in Dhamma practice has been explained
above. Note in particular that a Dhamma practitioner who has not yet
experienced a deeper happiness independent of sense objects cannot yet
be assured that he or she won’t return to seek out sense pleasures. Even
as a renunciant, if one has not yet experienced this profound,
non-material happiness, one is not yet safe. The mental defilements can
overwhelm the mind, leading one to relinquish the holy life. The Buddha
encouraged unawakened people to develop this internal, non-material
happiness. Besides increasing one’s degree of happiness and enhancing
the quality of one’s life, this internal happiness provides an escape
from the tyranny of craving, which leads to endless agitation and
heightened problems, both personal and social.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that if human beings are not willing to take an
interest in and get to know this non-material happiness, the
unrestrained rush for sense pleasure will create a superficial kind of
life, full of distress, anxiety, boredom, grief, and misery. Moreover,
it will be accompanied by competitiveness and mutual exploitation, until
people lead themselves and the entire world to utter annihilation.
{1059}</p>
<p>Given that ordinary, unawakened people who are immersed in the pursuit
of sense pleasure need to experience an inner happiness, it is twice as
important that those people who determine to distance themselves from or
to renounce sense pleasure have access to such happiness. This is even
more true for those individuals who go forth as renunciants, who engage
in higher spiritual practice, or who devote their lives to some ideal.
If they are unable to access such internal happiness, their renunciation
or devotion will fail to have a stable protection. It is likely that
they will fall away from their ideal and return to an unwholesome mode
of living. In short, if one lives a life of renunciation, one must be
happy with renunciation; if one devotes oneself to an ideal, one must be
happy about a life of devotion.</p>
<p>In a wider context, if we are unsuccessful at helping people to
recognize and appreciate this internal happiness, the craving for sense
pleasure will overwhelm the human race. It will be the final factor in
determining the fate of the world, regardless of the undertakings by
religious leaders and moral philosophers.</p>
<h2 id="happiness-and-ethics"><a class="header" href="#happiness-and-ethics">Happiness and Ethics</a></h2>
<p>Very often when people talk about religion or religious practice they
use the expression ’religion and ethics’. The development of happiness
is inextricably linked to improving one’s life, to improving society,
and to developing other aspects of spiritual practice. In this context
it is necessary to state that the development of happiness is equivalent
to the development of ethics, and conversely, ethical development is
equivalent to the cultivation of happiness. If one can understand this
connection then one will understand the true meaning both of ethics and
of happiness.</p>
<p>When people hear the word ’ethics’ or ’morality’ they often get the
sense of acting against one’s will. For example, when speaking about
ethics, people often think of needing to refrain from certain harmful or
evil behaviour, which gives the sense of force or constraint.</p>
<p>In truth, ethical development is one aspect of developing happiness.
True ethics belongs to the ’ethics of happiness’. If ethics is merely a
system of going against one’s will, or is tied up with suffering, then
it is not true ethics; it will not lead to true success. This is not to
say that ethics does not involve some form of constraint and
self-control. It does involve constraint, of which there are two kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Early stages of practice may involve some constraint, in the same
way that positive growth may require the removal of negative
qualities. Yet when one enters the correct path and one’s ethical
conduct is true, growth is unhindered. Negative qualities fall away
and one need not spend time removing them. Positive qualities
increase to the state of completion, at which point one’s life is
fully devoted to sharing goodness with others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second form of constraint is related to personal disposition.
There are some people, referred to as engaging in ’difficult,
arduous practice’ (<em>dukkhā paṭipadā</em>), whose disposition it is to be
forceful in practice. Yet their willingness and eagerness for
constraint leads to self-discipline. Instead of suffering about
constraint, they delight in training. They have the potential to
grow and succeed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ethics overlaps with spiritual training. According to the Buddha’s
teachings, human beings require spiritual training; they only reach
excellence and ’nobility’ by way of training. Spiritual training is
equivalent to spiritual development. People reach spiritual success by
way of training themselves. This is an aspect of human nature; one
cannot progress by simply following one’s raw instincts. For this reason
one can see that spiritual training is linked to human nature. People
can only grow and prosper by engaging in spiritual training.</p>
<p>If spiritual training unfolds correctly, it must be endowed with
happiness and it must be a training of happiness. If people are unhappy
while engaging in such practice, it can be assumed that they are not
training correctly. {1081}</p>
<p>When people engage in spiritual training, their lives undergo
development and increase in virtue and wholesomeness. This life of
virtue and rectitude is referred to as ’ethical conduct’
(<em>cariya-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn74">74</a></sup> Ethics and spiritual training thus must go
hand-in-hand. In fact, one need not use the term ’must’ here, because
when people practise correctly these two elements naturally proceed in
unison. When people engage in correct spiritual training, their lives
improve and they experience greater happiness. Spiritual training is
thus a cultivation in happiness. Moreover, every aspect of a person’s
life will be developed.</p>
<p>It is in this way that these factors are connected: spiritual training
is the development of happiness, spiritual training is equivalent to
ethical development, development in ethics is the cultivation of
happiness, etc. It is as the Buddha said: if one attends to the correct
causes and conditions, one need not make an appeal – the dynamics of
nature will proceed automatically. When rapture (<em>pīti</em>) arises, the
body and mind are refreshed and relaxed. One need not ask for this to
happen, or even to have this intention. Relaxation (<em>passaddhi</em>) then
follows naturally, according to things being ’just so’.</p>
<p>If a mother hen wishes for chicks to hatch, she incubates the eggs. At
the proper time the chicks peck through the eggshell and emerge. Yet if
the hen does not sit on the eggs, despite clucking loudly all day in
front of the coop, her efforts will be in vain, the eggs will rot, and
no chicks will appear.</p>
<p>Soon after the Second World War, technology was not as advanced as it is
today, and before people could get in a car and drive away, they would
have to use all their strength to turn the hand-crank. Sometimes they
would be utterly exhausted by the time the engine turned over. Nowadays,
however, one only need to turn one’s fingers an inch on the ignition and
the engine starts.</p>
<p>Here we see both the connection and the distinction between human
processes and the processes of nature. If we are to benefit from the
processes of nature, then we must seek ways for them to complement human
activities. The amount of strain and difficulty we experience depends on
how well we can link our activities to natural processes and have these
take over for us. If people are able to set up their activities
effectively and to link them with dynamics of nature, they will abide in
joy and at ease. And if people can accomplish this they will not have to
act against their will. There will be no need for other people or for
the government to exert pressure on them to act. Our responsibility is
simply to discern causes and conditions, and to then respond to them
correctly. We need neither appeal to things to be a specific way nor to
resist them.</p>
<p>There are some people, who rather than resist the processes of nature
try to regulate their desires. They wholeheartedly practise
self-restraint, and this restraint eventually becomes a form of
self-training. This is another natural unfolding.</p>
<p>Spiritual training is a way of developing people in happiness and in
other virtuous qualities. When they live a virtuous life they live an
ethical life. This is how ethics and training are defined in Buddhism.
{1082} Here we use the term ’Buddhism’ simply as a means for
communication. If Buddhism teaches the truth then it teaches nature, it
teaches how things naturally exist, how things exist according to their
own nature. A simple definition for Buddhism is thus a ’teaching of
natural truths’.</p>
<p>In sum, for spiritual training or ethical development to be true and
effective it must include a cultivation of happiness. Spiritual training
and ethical development are synonymous with a development of happiness.
If spiritual training is still accompanied by a lack of enthusiasm and
resistance, one will be unable to experience happiness. This is not
genuine training and its associated ethical discipline will be endowed
with force and compulsion. Likewise, this is not true ethical conduct.</p>
<h3 id="human-regulations-and-a-system-of-preconditions"><a class="header" href="#human-regulations-and-a-system-of-preconditions">Human Regulations and a System of Preconditions</a></h3>
<p>Many people harbour the misunderstanding that by inciting craving and
increasing greed people will work harder in order to obtain consumable
goods. They claim that such excess will spur the economy and lead to
greater wealth for all. At first glance this appears to be true, but
these people do not see things correctly and are thus mistaken.</p>
<p>Thinking in this way reveals a certain intelligence in engaging with
craving within a system of preconditions. Yet however skilled one is in
manipulating craving, it is almost impossible that such a method of
thinking will create someone like Albert Einstein. The best it can do is
produce technocrats working in business economics (who may create
excitement or alarm as a result of their research, which is often not of
great consequence. For problems to truly be solved, people need to
possess wholesome enthusiasm to match their intelligence).</p>
<p>Take a simple example from everyday life, of looking after one’s
physical body. One person endowed with wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>;
see the earlier section on different kinds of desire) cares for his
body, wishing for it to be strong, healthy, and clean. Another person
subject to craving is prone to laziness and does not normally show
concern for the body; later, when craving kicks in and he wants to
appear enticing to someone else he will try to make himself as
physically attractive as possible. Which of these two forms of behaviour
will be more conducive to the wellbeing of the body?</p>
<p>Now let us turn our attention to the system of preconditions required
for engagement with craving. Earlier a distinction between the process
of wholesome desire and the process of craving was described. In the
process of craving a fixed sense of self or self-identity arises. Now we
come to a second distinction. When craving acts as the motivation for
action, it creates a system of preconditions that acts as the driving
force for society (it is also the mechanism behind ’unsustainable’
development). When craving arises, people want to consume something. But
when the object has not yet been obtained, they look for ways to acquire
it. Here, things do not unfold according to the process of causes and
conditions, but rather they link up with a set of preconditions.</p>
<p>People may object here and say: ’Craving is also a desire for action.’
But this is not so – craving prefers idleness. Craving wishes to
consume, to obtain, to acquire. But if the desired object has not yet
been obtained, what can one do? Here, one must accord with the
stipulation: ’In order to get this, one must do that; one cannot obtain
the desired object without acting in this particular way.’ This is how
craving prompts activity within a system of preconditions. {1083}</p>
<p>Here, one acts not out of wholesome enthusiasm, but because the action
is a prerequisite for obtaining something. As the action is not a
response to a true wish to act, the person does not experience
happiness. There is not a wholehearted desire to act, and so the action
is accompanied by suffering.</p>
<p>Craving only spurs action because of preconditions; if one does not act,
one does not obtain the desired object, the consumption of which
provides happiness. The act itself, however, is done begrudgingly, and
one does not know how long one must wait in order to obtain the object
and to fulfil gratification. The entire waiting process is filled with
suffering. The long wait in order to obtain an object of gratification
produces stress. In the end this process is unsustainable and rather
than leading to true development, it leads to stress. Unsustainable
development results in a perpetual state of stress.</p>
<p>With wholesome enthusiasm, on the other hand, one wishes to act in order
to bring about improvement. One acts with the constant desire to act,
and one is thus happy throughout the duration of the deed. One
experiences no boredom or stress. This happiness is inherent to this
process; it results directly from the existing causes and conditions.
This principle applies to one’s studies, one’s work, indeed to all one’s
activities: if one acts with wholesome enthusiasm, one will find success
and happiness throughout.</p>
<p>Wholesome enthusiasm is essential. The Buddha compared it to the light
of the dawn. Just like the golden light of the dawn is the precursor to
the rising of the sun, so too, if one is endowed with wholesome
enthusiasm, it can be expected that one will flourish in spiritual
training and in the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
<p>The dynamic of wholesome enthusiasm does not require a lengthy
explanation, because it follows a natural process, according with causes
and conditions. Things become complicated because of an overlapping
system of preconditions set up by human beings. Human beings nowadays
are almost entirely dependent on a system based on preconditions. They
have used their intelligence to establish conventional measures
overlapping with natural laws, in order to obtain results based on
specific prerequisites.</p>
<p>Natural laws – laws of conditionality – exist inherent in nature.
Conventional laws are created and subscribed to by human beings in order
to meet and proceed according to specific preconditions. These two
overlapping laws play an important role in modern civilization. An
example of this pertains to the domain of work.</p>
<p>Imagine a government complex, for example a state university, with
spacious grounds and elegant buildings. People wish for this to be a
place of delight, to have fresh, green lawns and parks with various
species of flowering shrubs. How should one fulfil this desire? Here,
people use their intelligence to divide the labour and create a system
of agreed-upon standards.</p>
<p>We know that trees, plants, and grass thrive when they receive the
proper nourishment and nutriments, including water and fertilizer. This
pertains to natural causes and conditions, to fixed laws of nature.
Knowing this, people then consider how they can propel or induce these
natural causes and conditions. Here is where people establish an
overlapping set of rules and criteria. {1084}</p>
<p>Human laws are conventional truths (<em>sammati</em>); they are agreements
based on mutual knowledge and recognition. The Pali term <em>sammati</em>
refers to a shared understanding combined with a mutual agreement and
acknowledgement. Human laws are based on mutual contracts and
agreements.</p>
<p>For example, one may hire a person for $250 a month to be a gardener in
order to water and prune the plants, work the soil, remove weeds, etc.,
in order for the park to be a place of beauty and delight. Here, rules,
i.e. a set of criteria, have been established. The work as a gardener is
a precise and definite cause, producing the effect of receiving a
monthly salary. The salary appears to be the clear result of working as
a gardner. In fact, there are two overlapping laws at work here:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Laws of nature: the plants will only grow if there is a sufficiency
of various factors, like fertilizer and water. These laws are
certain and absolute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human laws: these are secondary laws established to induce the
various factors required for the dynamics of nature. These are
conventions, regulations, or laws established to create a position
of gardener funded by a monthly salary. These human laws deal with
human factors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The factors pertaining to human laws help to propel the factors inherent
in nature, so that they proceed in a way that fulfils the desires of
human beings. But as mentioned above, human laws are based on
conventional agreements. They are not certain and definite like natural
laws; they can be altered, distorted, or subject to manipulation and
deceit.</p>
<p>For example, the employer may not honour the agreement and only give the
person $200 per month. If the gardener does not consent, he may need to
dispute this matter or file a formal complaint. Conversely, the employee
may not dedicate himself to the work, and instead go off to sleep or go
drinking with his friends. Come the end of the month he demands his
salary, but he has not acted in accord with the laws of nature. Here,
although he receives $250, or even $300, there is no way for the
plants to thrive.</p>
<p>Of these two overlapping sets of laws, human laws are subject to
distortion. People may not follow through with their promises and
agreements. The result is that people get into arguments and are caught
up in the stipulations attached to these conventional laws. Such human
conventions can thus potentially cause all sorts of problems; they are
not truly reliable. The essence of human laws does not rest with the
laws themselves, but rather with people. If one wants these laws to be
successful, one needs to train people to be honest. In the end, the
essential factor is education; people need to learn to love the truth
and to abide in honesty. {1085]</p>
<p>Human laws are based on a system of preconditions. If one works for one
month as a gardener one receives $250. This appears to be a clearly
defined cause and effect. But what does a closer examination reveal?
Working for a month as a gardener cannot in itself produce a salary of
$250. The money only comes by way of a proviso. This is an example of a
provisional system or a system of preconditions.</p>
<p>Some people will only do the work in order to fulfil the preconditions.
One may do the gardening work simply to receive the salary, but in one’s
heart one has no desire for the plants to prosper and grow. If the
gardener only desires the results of the human stipulations and is not
interested in the direct results of the natural laws, he is not endowed
with wholesome desire; he is not interested in the welfare of the
plants. He is prompted not by wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>), but by
craving (<em>taṇhā</em>): he only wants the money. Craving is the driving force
leading the person to act according to the terms within the agreed-upon
conventions. If the gardener has no true desire for the plants to
flourish, he will not love his work; rather, he will have to force
himself to work. The work will thus be burdened with a sense of
suffering.</p>
<p>This is one of the vital problems for people in the present age. As
civilization develops, people’s suffering increases. People’s work,
activities, and education is beset by suffering because they are caught
up in this system of preconditions. They are caught up in a system of
craving.</p>

<p>Craving is normally accompanied by two other factors. As a group of
three these factors are referred to as <em>papañca-dhammā</em> (mental
defilements that cause complication, proliferation, and perturbation).
Here are simple definitions for these three factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Taṇhā</em>: the desire to obtain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Māna</em>: the desire for prominence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhi</em>: narrow-mindedness (attachment to personal views and
beliefs).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These three defilements focus and centre on one’s sense of self; they
are factors of selfishness. They cause problems within a system of
preconditions. Whenever they act as the force behind a system of
preconditions, they cause all sorts of confusion and turmoil. The
problems are not limited to suffering inherent in people’s work and
education; every sort of human problem is caused by these defilements,
leading to distress and agitation.</p>
<p>An awareness of these three defilements enables one to find a solution
to problems. The solution lies in applying one’s intelligence to find
ways for human conventional laws to link up with and support natural
laws. Clever people establish conventional laws which help lead natural
dynamics in a direction producing results consistent with their desires
and objectives. If we want a tree to grow then we provide the necessary
care, like pruning, watering, and adding fertilizer. Through division of
labour one organizes a gardener to devote his time and effort to this
task. One reassures this person that in respect to earning a living, he
will be provided with an adequate income. The gardener needs not be
anxious and can fully devote himself to this work. In this way one
establishes a bridge between human conventions and natural laws,
enabling people to create optimum causes and conditions aligned with
natural dynamics. {1086}</p>
<p>If the gardener possesses wholesome enthusiasm, he wishes to see the
plants flourish and he wants to act in order to bring about this state
of completion. If he is reassured about sustaining his livelihood, he
can devote himself fully to this task. In this way he experiences
happiness and receives a salary. The work is successful and the worker
is happy. In this way the system of human regulations is coordinated
with the causal dynamics of natural laws, so that they proceed
effectively in line with the wishes of human beings.</p>
<p>If, however, the gardener is devoid of wholesome enthusiasm acting as
the catalyst for natural dynamics, the work will not be successful. If
he acts simply from craving, desiring only the results promised by a
system of preconditions, he will be unhappy because he will have to
force himself to work, and the gardening work itself will be unfruitful.</p>
<p>If this lack of wholesome enthusiasm is prevalent, all human systems and
institutions will be distorted, imbalanced, and corrupted. Work will be
unsuccessful and people will be unhappy. Moreover, when people are
devoid of wholesome enthusiasm and dominated by craving, they do not
exert themselves in their work; they avoid their work and are dishonest
and deceitful, giving rise to corruption and waste. The consequence is
that one must emphasize secondary systems of supervision and control.</p>
<p>When craving takes hold of these systems of supervision, new overlapping
systems of control need to be established. The three defilements of
perturbation (<em>papañca-dhamma</em>) then cause further turmoil and distress.
In the end human society is led to ruin and calamity, as is described in
an old Thai poem: ’When the baht is spent, the tiger dies.’ (See
Note <a href="#note-loka-niti">Poem ’Loka Niti’</a>) For this reason it is important that a
system of preconditions does not destroy or crush wholesome enthusiasm.
One needs to be alert and use one’s intelligence to ensure that the
system of preconditions supports wholesome enthusiasm, which mobilizes
desirable natural processes.</p>
<p>In today’s age, which is dominated by systems based on greed, it is
still possible for wholesome and virtuous development to occur, because
enough people possess an adequate degree of wholesome enthusiasm, even
if this is not always obvious. We need to prevent a system of craving
from becoming the dominant dynamic, which eclipses wholesome enthusiasm
until it gradually recedes and eventually disappears. Instead, we ought
to make wholesome enthusiasm the mainstay; although craving may still
cause some trouble, people will retain an adequate degree of stability
and safety.</p>
<p>It is necessary to acknowledge that human systems of preconditions are
the driving force in the world. What are our options when we realize
that people exist at different levels of spiritual development, and that
most people are still committed to a system based on craving? It is not
sustainable for people to simply follow their desires. It is essential
that those people responsible for establishing the system of
preconditions are endowed with wholesome desire, and that they ensure
that wholesome desire is given a prominent role within such a system.
Moreover, they should set down decisive measures of heedfulness for all
people to use while engaged in developing themselves.</p>
<p>This key subject of desire tends to get overlooked. It is vital that one
is able to distinguish between wholesome and unwholesome desire. When
one has understood this matter it will be easy to determine how to solve
problems, and one will develop happiness with confidence. {1087}</p>

<p><span class="caption">Poem ’Loka Niti’</span><a id="note-loka-niti"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the poem ’Loka Niti’ (โลกนิติ). [Trans.: written in 1831. The
story goes that a zoo acquires a tiger, for which one baht is
allocated each day to keep it well-fed. The keeper responsible for
feeding the tiger embezzles 25 satang each day. When the director
notices that the tiger is not filled out he sends an inspector to find
out what is going on. When the inspector discovers the truth, he
demands 25 satang as hush money from the keeper. The tiger gets
thinner, prompting the director to send a more senior inspector. He
too demands 25 satang as hush money, and the tiger is soon just skin
and bones. The director sends the chief inspector, but he demands the
remaining 25 satang for himself, causing the tiger to perish.]</p>

<p>A frequently asked question in the modern age is how wholesome desire
functions in the domain of work. The term ’chanda’ can be simply
translated as ’pleasure’, ’liking’, or ’delight’. Take for example a job
interview, during which one is asked: ’Do you like this kind of work?’
The term ’like’ here is ambiguous. One person may answer, ’I like it’,
but imply that he likes the good salary or the fact that the work
requires little exertion and provides a lot of free time. This is one
kind of liking. Another person may reply, ’I like it’, on the grounds
that the work conforms to her skills, and that it is beneficial and
constructive to society. The terms ’like’ and ’desire’ encompass both
’craving’ (<em>taṇhā</em>) and ’wholesome enthusiasm’ (<em>chanda</em>). For this
reason it is important to clarify how one uses these terms.</p>
<p>It requires discernment to understand the real meaning of the question,
’Do you like this kind of work?’ which is: ’Does this work fit your
skills and do you see the value of this work?’ It is not a matter of
only liking the work because of a high income or an opportunity to be
lazy and have lots of time off, which stems from selfishness and
craving. If we have wholesome enthusiasm we truly love our work, because
we recognize its value; we see how it benefits society and helps develop
our nation.</p>
<p>If the social benefit of work is not clearly evident, or if one does not
recognize the wider value of one’s work – and yet the work is required
– one can generate wholesome enthusiasm with the attitude that the work
is valuable for self-development and leads to improvement in our own
lives. One aspect of work is that it is a domain for personal growth.
Every kind of work or activity, whether it involves a task that we enjoy
or not, is an opportunity for personal development. The more difficult
is the task, the greater is the opportunity to train, to sharpen skills,
and to increase intelligence.</p>
<p>If one can summon wholesome desire and generate a wish to train, one
will enjoy even those things previously found unpleasant and one will
delight even in difficult work. The more challenging the task, the more
one gains. By the time the task is complete, one has passed through an
extensive period of self-development.</p>
<p>Our daily work and activities take up the most amount of time in our
lives – approximately eight hours, or one third, of each day. The
remaining sixteen hours or so are taken up by sleeping or travelling, or
of simply being fatigued. For this reason one needs to make the most out
of these eight hours of productive activity. If one needs to force
oneself to do this work then one is in trouble; these eight hours will
be wasted and one’s life will be filled with unhappiness. It is thus
vital to generate wholesome desire, to recognize the importance of
having love for one’s work. One can tell oneself that by having such
love one will develop oneself, develop one’s capabilities, develop one’s
ability to solve problems, develop wisdom, and develop the mind. One
will grow in endurance, energy, self-restraint, mindfulness, and
concentration. This wholesome enthusiasm will bestow meaning to one’s
work and will increase one’s happiness.</p>
<p>When engaging in displeasurable work, the mind is stifled, without a
sense of relief. This mental constriction and confinement is suffering
indeed. The mind then gets caught in a cycle of such suffering. When the
mind finds a way out of this impasse, one feels relieved and happy.
Therefore, whenever one is experiencing difficulty, one should generate
such wholesome desire. Then every activity will be endowed with such
zeal, and as mentioned above, one will recognize that at the very least
one has a valuable opportunity to develop oneself. {1088}</p>
<p>Most often when working one must encounter other people. If one is not
plagued by stifling thoughts or emotions, these encounters are also an
opportunity for self-training. One can train for example in speech. What
sort of speech is effective, non-offensive, and conducive to friendship
and cooperation? All such activities are opportunities for training.</p>
<p>Work may be defined as those tasks necessary to accomplish. Wholesome
enthusiasm is the desire to perform these tasks, along with a desire to
understand the details of this work. The desire to act is thus
inherently an aspect of training and of study. True training is
comprised of the desire to know and the desire to act. By generating
this desire to know and act, the essence of training has been reached.
The desire to train, to learn, and to act is the same as the desire to
understand. When willingly engaged in a task, one trains oneself and is
engaged in study. Both formal learning and formal work are aspects of
training, because in both cases one is improving one’s life. If one
practises correctly, one’s entire life will be a form of training, of
self-development.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, one can use the term <em>chanda</em> in reference to all
activities; it does not simply refer to one’s work. There are two
aspects to this term:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Chanda</em> as a desire for a natural state of completion. Here, one
wishes for all things with which one is engaged to be well and in
good order, and to reach a state of natural completeness and
fulfilment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Chanda</em> as a desire to accord with causes and conditions; one
wishes for success directly in accord with causes and conditions.
For example, every profession has a natural objective. The objective
of the medical profession, for instance, is to cure people from
illness; the objective of the teaching profession is to instil
goodness and knowledge in children or in pupils.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We should ask ourselves what the direct purpose of our specific
individual profession is. Government work and the work by state
institutions, for example, requires a clear objective. Before beginning
a job, we should clearly investigate its objectives, and we then ask
ourselves whether we agree with and approve of them. When we decide to
then undertake the task, we can attend accurately to these objectives.
And through our enthusiasm and determination we seek to bring about
results consistent with these objectives. This is <em>chanda</em>.</p>
<p>As for a salary or financial remuneration, this is a matter belonging to
the system of preconditions. With wholesome desire and wisdom, one sees
that money is a support for devoting oneself fully to one’s work in
order to fulfil its objective, without needing to worry about how one
will earn one’s livelihood or to seek some other form of occupation.
Although one abides by a system of conventions, one understands and
benefits from it.</p>
<p>When people possess wholesome enthusiasm and understand the true purpose
of their work and the nature of the agreed-upon terms, the system will
not be seen simply as a way to force people to work. One will discern
that it aims to promote wholesome desire, so that people can commit
themselves fully to their work and be freed from financial worries. If
people have wholesome desire, are determined to perform their work in
order to fulfil its true purpose, have a love for this form of success,
and receive an adequate financial recompense, they and their families
will abide in wellbeing.</p>
<p>This correct, virtuous way of practice provides people with two kinds of
happiness. First, they derive happiness directly from their work,
knowing that they have attended to it correctly. Second, they feel
assured by the wages or salary, knowing that it will be a support to
further dedicate themselves to their activities. They are pleased that
their work progresses well, and they are confident that their
enthusiastic efforts lead to results consonant with the work’s true
objective, to the wellbeing of an institution or the nation, in a smooth
and lasting way. This is how a system based on wholesome desire
operates. {1089}</p>
<h3 id="fun-in-learning-happiness-in-training"><a class="header" href="#fun-in-learning-happiness-in-training">Fun in Learning, Happiness in Training</a></h3>
<p>Now let us turn our attention to education. In the process of learning
it is imperative to generate wholesome enthusiasm, for if this does not
occur, people will not experience real happiness while learning. The
best one can hope for in such a case is to have fun, which is the
happiness of someone dedicated to pleasure, similar to the pleasure
derived from watching a play or a movie.</p>
<p>If wholesome enthusiasm has been generated, whether one’s learning
process is fun or not becomes a minor, insignificant matter. Granted,
having fun fosters motivation and interest in students, and it is an
instrument for facilitating an understanding of the gist of the subject
at hand. Having fun, however, is not the essence of education; it is not
an essential part of the true learning process. In connection to the
explanation above, having fun is simply a supportive factor, which one
must know how to apply in order to aid wholesome desire and to enter the
true learning process.</p>
<p>Education begins with wholesome enthusiasm, and it is vital that
children possess such desire. Although amusement for children is useful
when it successfully helps to generate wholesome desire, without
wholesome desire one must rely entirely on having fun, and one must
constantly increase this sense of fun. Needing to constantly entertain
the children is wearisome for the teachers, who need to come up with new
ways of providing the students with fun activities.</p>
<p>It is true that an ability to make learning fun is an admirable skill,
but it is important to also instil wholesome enthusiasm. It is necessary
to distinguish these two qualities, and to ensure that fun is not simply
a way of gratifying the desire for pleasure, which is often the case say
by watching a movie. Otherwise, the teacher resembles an actor, and the
pleasure derived by having fun is a form of feeding craving.</p>
<p>This feeding of craving, by amusing oneself with sights, sounds, etc.,
gives rise to problems, which then need to be rectified. The basic
problem is an attachment to such enjoyment, along with a sense of apathy
and boredom, which requires people to seek increasingly greater amounts
and degrees of stimulation.</p>
<p>Using such entertainment in teaching will at first provide much fun for
the students, but eventually they will grow accustomed to and bored with
it. The next time one must add to the amusement, or introduce new forms
of entertainment, thus increasing the stimulation and gratification.
This becomes an endless cycle. The teachers become fatigued and the
students themselves are at a dead end, spinning around in a vortex of
craving. The students become addicted to such entertainment, only
seeking amusement. Rather than being fascinated with learning, they wait
for the next performance or show. They do not have the desire to learn
and to seek knowledge by themselves. In this way the flow of craving is
strengthened.</p>
<p>If one is not careful, children will not be interested in learning;
instead, they will only delight in the aspects of entertainment. They
will not advance to acquiring vital information, and they will not
generate wholesome enthusiasm. For this reason, it is essential that one
understands the proper role of entertainment and fun in education.
Having fun helps to create an initial interest in learning; it is a
preliminary and external factor in the true process of learning. It acts
as a link to something greater, not as an end goal.</p>
<p>The true purpose of external factors in education is to generate
internal factors within an individual. {1090} Teachers are an outside
influence (<em>paratoghosa</em>; ’a voice of encouragement and guidance’);
ideally they are a positive influence and act as virtuous friends
(<em>kalyāṇamitta</em>). They transmit knowledge and promote certain kinds of
seeing, listening, and thinking, in order for the pupils to generate
their own interest and enthusiasm, which then becomes the driving force
in their studies. Besides transmitting specific information, the true
success of a teacher thus rests with his or her ability to help generate
wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>) within the students. If teachers do not
have this aim, then all they can do is entertain the students, which
eventually leads to apathy and boredom on the part of the students, and
fatigue on the part of the teachers.</p>
<p>Teachers, virtuous friends, or other external influences need thus to
act as a medium, linking external factors with internal factors, and
helping students to generate virtuous qualities within themselves.
Otherwise, teachers reinforce in the students the characteristic of
being dependent on others. If teachers understand the true
responsibility of the teaching profession, they will seeks ways to
facilitate an understanding in the students of the subject materials and
to induce an interest in learning.</p>
<p>If students develop this wholesome enthusiasm, they can progress in
their studies independently. Although the teacher is not present, they
will say: ’I have a subject of study to pursue. I want to research this
matter. I wish to go to the library and read up on this subject.’ They
will derive happiness from this research because it satisfies their
interest in learning; it fulfils the desire to gain knowledge. In this
way learning will progress naturally and automatically.</p>
<p>If we are able to generate the wholesome desire as the starting point in
our studies, our entire way of life and pursuit of happiness will
change. And the new kind of happiness that gradually increases
throughout this process is exceptional and unexpected. Before, we only
relied on craving, seeking to obtain and consume things. We excitedly
pursued desirable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles for
consumption. When we experienced these things we felt gratification. Yet
when we encountered undesirable objects we were displeased, irritated,
and distressed. Our happiness and unhappiness was entirely dependent on
likes and dislikes subject to craving, and our views on happiness were
limited to this dynamic.</p>
<p>When one gives rise to wholesome enthusiasm, one experiences a new form
of desire. One wishes to truly learn about things and to act in order to
bring about improvement. When one obtains knowledge or does things well,
one is happy, and this happiness increases exponentially.</p>
<p>One’s relationship changes even to those things that are unpleasant and
were formerly distressing. When one sees that there are aspects to
undesirable things that are worthy of study and investigation one wants
to understand them. One asks such questions as: ’How is this object
bad?’ ’Why is this object undesirable?’ One begins to appreciate
unpleasant things because they provide an opportunity for learning.
Wholesome enthusiasm leads people to appreciate and even to derive joy
from undesirable things and situations. This happiness stems from
gaining knowledge and from one’s own skilful actions. {1091}</p>
<p>Note that wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>) is associated with and must be
accompanied by wisdom (<em>paññā</em>). This is unlike craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), which
is accompanied by ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>) and requires no wisdom. Craving
can arise at all times, while wholesome desire is only developed with
the help of wisdom.</p>
<p>How is wholesome desire accompanied by wisdom? Say one encounters a
disagreeable, unpleasant object, which is rejected by craving. Yet when
wisdom recognizes that the object is beneficial in some way, wholesome
enthusiasm participates in the process. The desire to know and the
desire to act are set in motion, and happiness follows along with the
fulfilment of this desire.</p>
<p>With the introduction of wholesome enthusiasm, likes and dislikes based
on craving lose almost all of their influence and power. Those things
previously considered unacceptable by craving – those things which used
to be deplorable and cause affliction – now, with the power of wisdom
and wholesome desire, are able to provide happiness.</p>
<p>In this way, one who begins a true form of education and training is
able to find happiness even from those things that do not offer
gratification to craving. This process of learning then develops,
whereby preferences and aversions gradually lose their ability to
overwhelm and sway the mind. One’s attention, thoughts, and happiness
centres around knowledge and skilful action. This is how someone like
Albert Einstein comes to be.</p>
<p>On a practical level, if one is able to establish an education system
promoting a basic level of wholesome enthusiasm, the nation will have an
increased number of ’creators’, who will offset those ’consumers’ who
have no desire to act, other than to find ways to satisfy their craving.</p>
<p>In sum, this process involves a delight in the goodness and completion
of something. If the object has not yet reached such a state of goodness
and completion, one wants to act in order to help bring about this
state, and one wants to know what needs to be done to accomplish this
(alternatively, the desire to know precedes the desire to act). When one
has gained the necessary knowledge, one is able to act according to
one’s wishes. When one completes the action and satisfies one’s desire,
happiness follows, and this happiness increases the more one
accomplishes.</p>
<p>The desire to know and the desire to act function in unison. These
aspects of desire lead to and are accompanied by happiness and true
learning. If these two aspects of desire are absent, learning will be
difficult and students will be unwilling and unhappy. If one is able to
generate wholesome enthusiasm, learning will proceed automatically, in
the same way as the Buddha stated that with dawn as harbinger, the
rising of the sun is guaranteed.</p>
<p>In connection to society, to the relationship with other people,
wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>) can be expanded into four spiritual
qualities, referred to as the four ’divine abidings’ (<em>brahmavihāra</em>;
literally, ’qualities characteristic of Brahma gods’ or ’supreme
spiritual qualities’): lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>), compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>),
sympathetic joy (<em>muditā</em>), and equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>).</p>
<p>Here, one can see how the development of desire runs parallel to the
development of happiness; in fact these two forms of development are
identical. As one elevates desire from craving to wholesome enthusiasm,
and as one develops this enthusiasm, happiness is expanded and deepened.
{1092}</p>
<h3 id="joy-in-learning-and-joy-from-learning"><a class="header" href="#joy-in-learning-and-joy-from-learning">Joy in Learning and Joy from Learning</a></h3>
<p>Although deriving happiness in one’s studies is important as part of the
process of learning, it is not enough. Happiness is not simply a stage
in learning or in spiritual practice, but rather it is the most
essential part and the goal of one’s studies. If one understands the
true nature of happiness, one will discern that study or training is in
itself a development of happiness in order for the student or
practitioner to be truly happy.</p>
<p>The genuine development of happiness requires a fulfilment of spiritual
qualities, which are present in those people who are accomplished. I
have written several books on this subject of happiness as the goal of
education or of spiritual training; let us review some of the material
in these books.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn75">75</a></sup></p>
<p>The true purpose of education is to provide people with happiness. It is
not enough for people to enjoy their studies; education also needs to
lead people to happiness. People then dwell in a normal state of
happiness. Moreover, the learning process itself is also endowed with
happiness.</p>
<p>Does modern education provide people with happiness, or does it make
people simply hunger and yearn for happiness? An incorrect form of
education leads people to discontentment; it becomes an instrument for
sucking happiness out of people and making them thirst for it.</p>
<p>The further one studies in such a defective system of education, the
greater is one’s thirst for true happiness. One is in want of happiness
while studying, and one graduates from this system with yearning. One
then rushes ahead in order to find personal happiness, competing for it
and creating suffering and hardship for others.</p>
<p>When people who are deprived of happiness experience suffering, they
vent their frustrations out on others and seize whatever happiness they
can find for themselves. If children are taught in such a harmful way,
upon completion of their studies they will seek to maximize their own
personal happiness. {1093}</p>
<p>In this modern, technically developed age, one sees how people are
caught up in the pursuit of happiness, to the extent that they no longer
have the time for others. They are in a constant state of want and
pursuit of happiness, and they keep expecting it to arrive in the
future. The thirst for happiness is rampant throughout the entire
society, including in family households, schools, and workplaces. The
mind state of happiness deprivation is widespread, apparent throughout
society. For this reason we must emphasize that true education makes
people happy and teaches people to look for happiness in the correct
ways.</p>
<p>Those people who have passed a correct system of education are able to
solve problems, dispel suffering, and establish themselves in happiness.
They cultivate themselves in order to reach more refined forms of
happiness, and they share their happiness with others in a wide-ranging
way.</p>
<p>People who suffer from some form of problem often vent their frustration
on others, and although this is an attempt on their part to find some
kind of ease, their actions cause harm to others and to society. This
includes those children who have some kind of difficulty and
consequently act out in negative ways. On the contrary, those people who
abide in happiness tend to share their joy with others, even when there
is no direct intention to do so. Thus, to increase happiness in the
world, we need to increase happiness in individuals.</p>
<p>This corresponds with the Buddha’s aim in relation to society:
<em>abyāpajjhaṃ sukhaṃ lokaṃ</em>: ’to create and abide in a world that is
happy, free from oppression.’ This is our task as human beings: to
create a happier world, to reduce oppression, to offer mutual support
and assistance, and to abide in collective, lasting happiness.</p>
<h3 id="despite-the-glut-of-consumable-objects-happiness-is-on-the-wane"><a class="header" href="#despite-the-glut-of-consumable-objects-happiness-is-on-the-wane">Despite the Glut of Consumable Objects, Happiness is on the Wane</a></h3>
<p>One of the consequences of the inability to know what is enough and the
constant pursuit of happiness is that people develop the characteristic
of being prone to suffering and find it increasingly difficult to be
happy.</p>
<p>Compare this with children. Most children, from the early days before
they could walk, laugh openly, smile with delight, and are easily
amused. Little things that they obtain or see give them happiness. But
as people grow up, they find it more and more difficult to find
happiness. As mentioned above, those things that at one time provided
happiness are now considered boring, leading to indifference and a lack
of enthusiasm. In order to be happy, things must accord with a long list
of desires and preconditions. And yet these people still don’t
experience real gratification. They chase after things without ever
reaching their destination. It becomes more and more difficult to
satisfy them.</p>
<p>When it becomes increasingly difficult for people to be happy, they also
become more easily agitated. Before, going without certain things,
living with certain inconveniences, and being required to perform
certain tasks was not a problem. These situations didn’t cause
suffering. {1129} Later on, they may become well-off, own an abundance
of things, and be extremely comfortable. They can order others to do
their own work – the only muscle in the body that gets exercised is the
index finger. But they may become attached to this ease and convenience.
If they lack anything, if something doesn’t arrive exactly on time, if
they don’t get what they want, or they must do something requiring
effort – all of these situations become a source of suffering. They
thus become more prone to suffering and they accumulate suffering.</p>
<p>This runs counter to true spiritual development. If one is engaged in
proper spiritual development, as one gets older one should be more
proficient at being happy, one should be able to increasingly generate
internal happiness, and one should find it easier to be happy and be
less prone to suffering. Those who are developing spiritually must be
simultaneously developing in happiness; their happiness must be
increasing. Within the ordinary sphere of human living situations or
responsibilities, they should feel confident about experiencing
happiness. They can make the claim to others: ’Don’t waste your time
trying to make me unhappy; you won’t succeed.’</p>
<p>These days, however, the reverse seems to be occurring. People seem to
find it increasingly difficult to discover happiness, and they are
unnaturally more prone to suffering. Many children in the IT age seem to
have this trait. One cause for this is that the upsurge in technological
advances permits a quick gratification of desire in regard to consuming
material things, and it increases material comfort. The drawback is that
people become more easily jaded, or else they feel they cannot live
without these comforts. In order to feel satisfied, they must acquire
things as quickly as they desire them.</p>
<p>The real reason, however, is an inadequate and incorrect spiritual
practice. The result is that, instead of technological growth helping to
promote true happiness, it ends up crippling people’s ability to
experience happiness. People then become incapable of experiencing true
happiness. This is what happens when people deal with technology
incorrectly. They fail to derive the true benefit from it; instead of
receiving its positive effects, they receive its negative ones.</p>
<p>The greater the abundance of material things, and the greater the ease
and convenience in society, the more important it becomes for people to
train their minds and develop the ability to find happiness. If people
simply get caught up in pursuing pleasure from external objects, they
will find it increasingly difficult to be happy. At the same time, they
will neglect the training in an increased capability to experience
happiness. Besides squandering an opportunity to develop themselves,
they may eventually be incapable of any form of happiness. For this
reason, give heed to developing one’s capability to experience
happiness.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there will be no end to problems. People’s own search for
happiness will be futile and their internal suffering will intensify.
Mutual oppression in society will increase, and the world will become a
more troubled place. There will be no hope for peace. If one develops
happiness correctly, however, all internal dilemmas will be resolved.
Various spiritual factors will be activated and set into place, because,
in a correct spiritual practice, the vital spiritual factors are
naturally linked and integrated. {1130}</p>
<p>Sense desire – the desire for material objects – is thus fraught with
danger, and it is the cause for various kinds of wrongdoing. People
desire sense pleasure within a ’system of preconditions’. (See the
earlier material on this subject, which is linked to the material here.)
The result is that the extent and range of immoral conduct is amplified.
This is how craving operates within a system of preconditions, in which
people seek desirable objects by avoiding, or by half-heartedly
conforming to, the direct processes of nature. Our responsibility is
thus to help people to develop wholesome desire and to integrate human
laws with natural laws.</p>
<p>This gives an outline of the advantages and disadvantages of happiness.
The essential point is that one applies ’liberating wisdom’
(<em>nissaraṇa-paññā</em>) in regard to all forms of happiness, beginning with
sense pleasure, until one reaches the freedom from mental defilement.
While experiencing happiness, be vigilant and know moderation. This way
one will remain strong and avoid mental weakness.</p>

<p>In the development of happiness it is important not to neglect the term
<em>dukkha</em> (suffering). An acknowledgement is made that suffering exists,
and that it is both placed in opposition to and paired alongside
happiness. People need to gain a comprehensive and clear perspective of
these matters, rather than practise avoidance and leave unresolved
issues to fester in the mind.</p>
<p>Moreover, if one is happy yet suffering still exists, then that
happiness is not true and reliable. Therefore the development of
happiness implies the simultaneous reduction, removal, disappearance,
and cessation of suffering. The expression ’development of happiness’
can thus be replaced with the expression ’cessation of suffering’ –
these refer to one and the same process. And for this process to be
complete, regardless of how much happiness a person may experience, one
must reach the stage of the utter cessation of suffering.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, to counter the sense that the development of
happiness is open-ended and without a clear end-goal, it is referred to
as the ’cessation of suffering’. The term ’cessation’, which is a
translation for the Pali term <em>nirodha</em>, carries with it specific
linguistic problems, in that its meaning is not altogether clear and it
may give rise to misunderstanding. When people hear the phrase
’cessation of suffering’, they may understand that this refers to a
gradual yet constant elimination or removal of suffering existing in the
heart. In fact, the true meaning of <em>nirodha</em> refers to the non-arising
of suffering, or to the complete and utter freedom from suffering. On
the highest level, <em>nirodha</em> refers to Nibbāna, a state completely free
from suffering.</p>
<p>Occasionally the term <em>anuppāda-nirodha</em> is used, translated as
’cessation by means of non-arising’, that is, absolute or complete
cessation. For the sake of convenience, we may thus translate
<em>dukkha-nirodha</em> as the ’non-arising of suffering’ or ’freedom from
suffering’.</p>
<p>Partly for ease-of-mind of the listeners, when this subject is
discussed, the term ’suffering’ is often avoided and instead the process
is described as the ’development of happiness’. Note, however, that by
doing so one is not neglecting the subject of suffering, and eventually
one will need to address it accordingly. The expression ’development of
happiness’ necessarily implies the proper management of suffering.
{1104}</p>
<p>An essential aspect of suffering is one’s attitude and relationship to
it. If one fails to understand the importance of this point, then one
will be unable to truly develop in happiness. Here we are referring to
the duty or responsibility (<em>kicca</em>) vis-à-vis suffering. If one gets
this wrong, then one’s entire spiritual practice will be misdirected and
end in failure. People often neglect this essential factor.</p>
<p>As suffering is the first noble truth, let us review the duties or
responsibilities pertaining to all four of the noble truths:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suffering (<em>dukkha</em>): a state of pressure and affliction, acting as
a basis for human problems; alternatively, anything that has the
capacity to create problems. The associated responsibility here is
<em>pariññā</em>: thorough or comprehensive understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cause of suffering (<em>samudaya</em>). The associated responsibility is
<em>pahāna</em>: abandoning, eliminating, or ending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cessation of suffering (<em>nirodha</em>). The associated responsibility is
<em>sacchikiriyā</em>: realizing, seeing clearly, actualizing, or
attaining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Path (<em>magga</em>): the way leading to the end of suffering. The
associated responsibility is <em>bhāvanā</em>: cultivating, developing,
practising, or undertaking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Without going into a lengthy analysis of these four responsibilities
here, note however that they are of fundamental importance. They exist
inextricably paired with the Four Noble Truths. For if one practises any
one of the Four Noble Truths incorrectly, in respect to its associated
duty or responsibility, one’s progress in the Dhamma will come to naught
and one’s efforts will be in vain; it will be impossible to awaken or to
realize the Dhamma.</p>
<p>In respect to the first noble truth, the Pali states: ’With suffering
there should be thorough understanding’ (<em>dukkhaṃ pariññeyyaṃ</em>).
Suffering must be understood by way of wisdom – suffering is there to
be understood. A simple example of this is that before one is able to
solve a problem, one must first understand the nature of the problem.</p>
<p>The definition of <em>dukkha</em> is not limited to the general concept of
physical and mental pain and discomfort. The term also refers to
everything that has the potential to create a sense of oppression when
one fails to respond to it correctly. For this reason the subject of
suffering requires comprehensive understanding. In sum, suffering is a
matter to be taken up and dealt with by wisdom. It is not something to
be stored up and accumulated in the heart, until it oozes out or goes
rancid and one loses one’s radiance and joy.</p>
<p>If one encounters suffering, welcome it with wisdom. Don’t allow the
mind to get caught up with it, or as people informally say, ’Don’t
obsess over your emotions.’ Don’t burden or oppress the mind with
suffering. And if the mind has already allowed it entry, don’t let it
smoulder. Hasten to send it on to wisdom. If one simply stores up
suffering within the heart, one suffers in vain; one does not dispel it
and one’s life becomes stuck. Yet if one allows wisdom to deal with it,
besides finding solutions to end it, one’s whole life moves forward.</p>
<p>It is not the mind’s responsibility to deal with suffering; this
responsibility rests with wisdom. The mind’s task is not to bear
suffering, but rather to apply wisdom. The principal agent in this
matter is wisdom, which solves problems and dispels suffering. Wisdom
brings suffering to an end, and at the same time generates happiness.</p>
<p>The mind’s responsibility is to witness happiness. One should develop
the mind’s proficiency for experiencing happiness, and develop wisdom’s
ability to solve problems and dispel suffering. A healthy mind is
endowed with happiness; and healthy wisdom is capable of dispelling
suffering. For the mind to be truly healthy and happy, wisdom must
completely dispel suffering. {1105}</p>
<p>Spiritual practice needs to be accurate, by attending to the duty
corresponding to each of the Four Noble Truths. If one oppresses oneself
by accumulating suffering – causing internal distress, frustration, and
depression – one is responding to suffering incorrectly. Instead, one
needs to change course and summon wisdom to help.</p>
<p>Happiness is classified as part of the third noble truth – cessation
(<em>nirodha</em>). It is recognized that there are relative degrees of
happiness which need to be developed until one reaches supreme
happiness. The responsibility here is <em>sacchikiriyā</em>: to realize,
actualize, or perfect happiness. This development of happiness should be
attended to as a regular and constant part of one’s life. The ability to
be happy is the starting point of spiritual practice. For this reason
one needs to establish oneself correctly from the outset, so that one
goes in the right direction and proceeds with confidence.</p>
<h3 id="practice-being-free-from-suffering"><a class="header" href="#practice-being-free-from-suffering">Practice Being Free From Suffering</a></h3>
<p>The spiritual journey begins with an understanding of happiness. As one
progresses along the journey, there is another key principle that
directly benefits one’s practice. This principle has to do with how one
relates to happiness, and it also pertains inherently to one’s
relationship to suffering.</p>
<p>In the Devadaha Sutta the Buddha outlines this method of practice in
regard to happiness. It contains four factors:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn76">76</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To refrain from creating extra suffering for oneself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To not forsake righteous happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To not indulge in any sort of happiness, even righteous happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To strive in order to bring an end to the cause of suffering (i.e.
to strive in order to realize higher forms of happiness, all the way
to supreme happiness).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1.</strong> It is common for people to create unnecessary suffering for
themselves. They may be abiding in a state of wellbeing, free from
distress, yet still inflict suffering on themselves. Examples of this
are those people who drink excessive amounts of alcohol or indulge in
addictive drugs. Many of them start out healthy, yet still consume these
things, even though they clearly know that they are harmful, both
physically and mentally. Although they possess this knowledge, they
create suffering and problems.</p>
<p>On a more subtle level, people often gather and accumulate various sense
impressions, like sights or sounds, that are slightly bothersome or
annoying. Trivial things done or said by others – things that are part
of the past – are stored up in people’s minds. Later, when they are
alone, they dig these things up and proliferate over them, causing
misery and unhappiness. This is another example of piling suffering onto
oneself.</p>
<p>In respect to householders, it is not considered blameworthy to have
some degree of mental proliferation – to elaborate on one’s experiences
– but the encouragement is to think in positive rather than negative
ways. Negative mental proliferations are called ’unwholesome formations’
(<em>apuññābhisaṅkhāra</em>), which are marked by greed, hatred, and delusion,
and which generate suffering. {1106}</p>
<p>Mindfulness (<em>sati</em>) should be applied here as a restraint, in order to
cease thinking in negative ways. Instead, one thinks in wholesome ways
and creates positive mental formations (<em>puññābhisaṅkhāra</em>), beginning
with joy (<em>pāmojja</em>). Joy is then followed by bliss (<em>pīti</em>) and
tranquillity (<em>passaddhi</em>). This is the way to solve problems and to
generate happiness.</p>
<p>The Buddha described the ascetic practices of the Nigaṇṭhā (Jains), who
clearly inflicted suffering on themselves. Instead of using a blade to
shave their heads, they used tweezers to pull out each hair, one at a
time. They devised all sorts of strategies to increase suffering. They
would drive in nails or thorns to their sleeping platforms and lie on
these; they would abstain from food and water for long periods; in the
cold season they would immerse in chilly rivers; in the hot season they
would stand out in the blazing sun.</p>
<p>The Buddha described these practices of self-mortification as examples
of self-inflicted suffering. These are examples from history. The reader
can think of comparable ways in which modern people unnecessarily pile
suffering onto themselves.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Righteous happiness can be found in everyday situations. Take for
example those laypeople who earn their living honestly. They use their
money for enjoyment and to support their families and dependants,
according to the teaching on the four kinds of happiness for
householders (<em>gihi-sukha</em>): the happiness of having wealth; the
happiness of spending wealth; the happiness of being free from debt; and
the happiness of performing virtuous and blameless deeds – of
performing good deeds by way of body, speech, and mind – happiness that
causes no harm to anyone. This kind of righteous happiness should not be
neglected or forsaken.</p>
<p>There are numerous kinds of righteous happiness. There is the happiness
stemming from generosity (<em>dāna</em>), moral conduct (<em>sīla</em>), and
cultivation of the mind (<em>bhāvanā</em>). There is the elevated happiness of
developing tranquillity meditation (<em>samatha-bhāvanā</em>) and insight
meditation (<em>vipassanā-bhāvanā</em>). Alternatively, there is the happiness
of lovingkindness and compassion, or the happiness of the four
principles of service (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>; see below).</p>
<p>In sum, these kinds of happiness should not be renounced or objected to
(those people who adhere to a doctrine of extreme asceticism aim to
inflict more suffering on themselves, and they thus shun happiness).</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Non-indulgence in any form of happiness is a vital factor and
indicates an advanced level of spiritual development. Experiencing
righteous forms of happiness is already an excellent step in spiritual
practice. But problems can arise due to such happiness, namely, people
may get attached to or blindly absorbed in it. This attachment or
indulgence leads to laziness, heedlessness, and decline. One who is able
to escape from this pitfall has reached an important stage in practice.</p>
<p>When one has reached this stage, happiness is unable to dominate the
mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, one does not fall into heedlessness. Happiness does not
become a harmful influence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, one does not lose one’s independence; one is not enslaved by
happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third, one has the opportunity to develop higher forms of happiness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The effort to bring an end to the cause of suffering leads to
perfect happiness. As long as the source or seed of suffering remains,
there is still the potential for suffering to resurface; suffering is
still latent. At this stage happiness is still imperfect; here, the
cause of suffering must be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>This final factor explains why the term ’cessation of suffering’ is so
widely used. It points clearly and definitively to the necessary task.
As stated earlier, the expression ’development of happiness’ is useful,
but it is open-ended; it does not clearly indicate the final goal of
practice. {1107} Although this process can be described in both a
positive and a negating way, only a negating description is decisive and
clear: suffering is completely removed, with perfect happiness
remaining.</p>
<p>The expression ’to strive in order to bring an end to…’ indicates how
the elimination of the cause of suffering goes hand in hand with effort.
The causes for suffering do not necessarily vanish immediately. Rather,
one gradually reduces greed (<em>lobha</em>), hatred (<em>dosa</em>) and delusion
(<em>moha</em>), and weakens craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), conceit (<em>māna</em>) and fixed
views (<em>diṭṭhi</em>). In this way, one practises according to the Path, by
developing virtuous conduct, concentration and wisdom. Mental
defilements diminish and ignorance decreases. Relatively speaking, this
is the same as gradually increasing happiness.</p>
<p>This fourth factor can thus be paraphrased as the ’development of
happiness’, but for the sake of clarity, one adds the qualification: ’to
develop happiness to perfection’. This is why the earlier definition in
parentheses states: to strive in order to realize higher forms of
happiness, all the way to supreme happiness (<em>parama-sukha</em>).</p>
<p>For this fourth factor to be fulfilled, one must link it with the third
factor, of not indulging in any form of happiness – of not getting
stuck, acting heedlessly, abandoning oneself to some form of pleasure,
or ceasing to make effort. The fulfilment of the third factor enables
one to reach the fourth factor and to reach spiritual perfection.</p>
<p>Another way of describing the proper relationship to happiness is to
focus on four main factors of spiritual practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Heedfulness: this factor applies to everyone. It is an important
reminder, because happiness induces fascination, captivation,
procrastination, inertia, laziness, and carelessness. One thus needs
to take care not to fall into heedlessness. History shows us that
almost every successful person, family, society, nation, or even
civilization, having reached a level of prosperity and growth, tends
to become indulgent and careless, and eventually falls into ruin and
destruction.</p>
<p>This is a crucial issue for families, and parents must take great
care. Even the supreme virtue of lovingkindness can be excessive, in
the case when parents pamper and pander to their children, and do
not apply equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>) as a balancing force. Eventually
their children become weak, careless, indulgent, emotionally
stunted, and unable to face the challenges of life. The family will
consequently be undermined and ruined.</p>
<p>This is true also for individuals. At first one may strive to
establish oneself in the world, yet when one is wealthy and happy,
one may become indulgent and heedless, eventually falling into
decline. In sum, one should beware against carelessness in regard to
states of happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking favourable opportunities: when one encounters suffering, one
generally feels oppressed, stifled, and obstructed. Everything one
does feels difficult, and great effort is required. The advantage to
this sense of obstruction and difficulty, however, is precisely
because of the need for increased effort in the face of suffering.
As a result there is learning, training, and development. When one
acts appropriately in response to suffering, one grows and reaches
great success.</p>
<p>The Pali term <em>sukha</em> (’happiness’) can also be translated as
’fluent’, ’smooth’, ’convenient’, or ’easy’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn77">77</a></sup> When things are
convenient, smooth, and easy, one should hasten to accomplish
necessary deeds. When one experiences happiness, one should use this
valuable opportunity for getting things done. {1108}</p>
<p>Using this opportunity to act is better than allowing happiness to
lure one into a trap of enchantment and fixation, which only leads
to indulgence and heedlessness. With the assistance by firmly
established wisdom, one goes in the opposite direction, of using the
opportunity provided by happiness to strive to get things done. This
generates even greater spiritual growth and development.</p>
<p>One who has developed in this way is able to derive benefit from
both happiness and suffering. Indeed, the term ’Dhamma practitioner’
implies the ability to use wise reflection and to discern the
advantages in every situation, to think in such ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>’There is happiness. Good. Conditions are easy, convenient,
smooth. This provides an opportunity to accomplish things to the
utmost.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’There is suffering. Good. Conditions are challenging. I need to
make great effort. Bring them on. I will proceed undaunted.’</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Independence: independence, or freedom, is the goal of Buddhism.
True independence is founded on freedom of the heart – mental
freedom. A prominent feature of this mental freedom is freedom in
relation to happiness.</p>
<p>Independence follows on from the first factor, of heedfulness – of
not being dominated and led astray by happiness. The first factor,
however, is one of negation – of countering the urge to indulge –
whereas this fourth factor passes beyond, to a level of inner
freedom.</p>
<p>Those who are spiritually developed are endowed with happiness, but
they remain unattached to this happiness. Those who are fully
developed experience free, independent happiness, yet are in no way
bound or reliant on this happiness. For those individuals still in
training, establishing this independence permits them to develop
further.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Further development: this refers to the recognition that one still
needs to make progress in one’s spiritual practice.</p>
<p>These four factors work together in harmony. They lead to supreme
happiness and to the complete removal of the source of suffering.
One both abides in happiness and develops happiness; and one
experiences happiness throughout this entire process of spiritual
development.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="happiness-in-the-household"><a class="header" href="#happiness-in-the-household">Happiness in the Household</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of practical application, it is useful to look at three
aspects of happiness that the Buddha often mentioned: sense pleasure
(<em>kāma-sukha</em>), happiness in society, and happiness in spiritual
development.</p>
<p>The Buddha spoke at length on the subject of sense pleasure, because it
pertains to everyone in the world. Sense pleasure stems from contact by
way of the sense doors; it relies on sense engagement and is dependent
on material things. It is the happiness of obtaining something for one’s
own personal consumption. The improper response to and mismanagement of
sense pleasure is the source of myriad problems in the world, both
personal and social, including interpersonal conflict, competition, and
persecution. If one is to solve human problems effectively, one must
address this issue; one must encourage people to develop wisdom in order
to manage sense desire and sense pleasure correctly. At the very least,
the advantages of engagement with sense pleasure should outweigh the
harm. In any case, the subject of sense pleasure has been covered at
length earlier in this chapter. Here, let it suffice simply to mention
it as one aspect of happiness highlighted by the Buddha. {1109}</p>
<p>The second kind of happiness – happiness in society – is derived from
friendship, goodwill, and living together with kindness and compassion.
The two primary sets of principles pertaining to this form of happiness
are the four ’divine abidings’ (<em>brahmavihāra</em>) and the four ’bases of
social solidarity’ (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>). Moreover, if one wishes for
society or a democracy to be truly stable, one needs to foster the six
’virtues conducive to communal life’ (<em>sārāṇīya-dhamma</em>; see below).</p>
<p>The primary emphasis for this kind of happiness focuses on the divine
abidings, which have been explained above. Here, for the sake of
practical application, we can look at the key example of how these
mental states exist in family situations, beginning with the happiness
of parents when they witness the wellbeing and happiness of their
children.</p>
<p>Parents are often used as an example when explaining the four divine
abidings of lovingkindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and
equanimity, because it is in their nature for parents to possess these
qualities. Mothers, in particular, epitomize these qualities, and are
thus used as a standard in scriptural explanations. Mothers wish for
their children to be happy, healthy, and content, free from pain and
illness. To see her child happy fulfils a basic wish of a mother, which
in turn makes her happy. This wish for the child to be happy and healthy
is called lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>).</p>
<p>If their child falls ill, parents will be anxious and concerned. They
will strive to treat the illness, find a cure, and restore the child to
good health. They will not feel happy until the child is cured. When the
child completely recovers from the illness, the parents are satisfied;
their wishes have been fulfilled and they experience happiness. This
wish for the child to be free from suffering and to recover a state of
wellbeing is called compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>).</p>
<p>If the child grows up well, is physically attractive and graceful,
excels in his or her studies, finds good work and is promoted to a good
position, i.e. the child prospers and thrives, the parents are delighted
and the wish for their child to blossom and succeed is fulfilled. This
wish for the child to thrive and discover ever greater happiness, and
the shared rejoicing when this wish is fulfilled, is called appreciative
joy (<em>muditā</em>).</p>
<p>According to most people, the parents are now fully endowed with
virtuous qualities. But according to the four divine abidings,
completion has not yet been reached. The parents can comfort their
children, but they have not yet truly helped them grow. The children are
not yet truly mature, or one can even say that the children are not
grown up – they will remain dependent on their parents for emotional
support.</p>
<p>One needs to remember the fourth factor of equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>). In
the case that children need to learn how to take responsibility for
their lives and their actions, parents must let go and refrain from
acting on behalf of their children. Instead, they should stand back and
watch their children lead their own lives, in their own fashion. The
parents do not interfere and meddle in their children’s lives. This
equanimity begins already when the children first learn how to stand,
all the way up to the time they leave the home, get married, and look
after their own families.</p>
<p>At this time when children leave home and start their own families,
parents are discouraged from barging into their children’s new homes and
interfering in their affairs. They should refrain from trying to
organize and rearrange their children’s lives. Otherwise they become a
source of suffering for their children, creating conflict and discomfort
for them and their spouses. {1110}</p>
<p>When one recognizes that one’s children are growing up and that the time
has come for them to look after themselves, one steps back and observes.
If one sees that they require some help or support, one provides
assistance – one doesn’t abandon them. One can still offer guidance and
advice, but one refrains from interfering too much.</p>
<p>This wish for the child to abide in a correct and purposeful way, to not
behave in a faulty or errant manner, and to live righteously – while
the parents maintain dispassion, objectivity, and impartiality – is
called equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>). This factor of equanimity needs to be
emphasized, because many people misunderstand it and thus do not know
how to apply it effectively. Equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>) is the link between
emotions and knowledge. It is the balancing point between love and
insight, the meeting point between the mind (<em>citta</em>) and wisdom
(<em>paññā</em>).</p>
<p>In regard to the first three divine abidings, it is recommended to
combine these with wisdom so that they lead to beneficial results. But
in everyday life, it is not always certain that wisdom will play a
participatory role. For example, it is possible to love without being
wise. Equanimity, however, stems directly from wisdom – it can only
arise accompanied by wisdom. (Equanimity without wisdom is a counterfeit
equanimity and may be referred to as ’stupid indifference’.)</p>
<p>With the balancing influence of equanimity, the practice by parents of
the first three divine abidings helps children to develop emotionally
and promotes mental health. The children will be able to feel love,
goodwill, and compassion. But if things are imbalanced by the absence of
equanimity, parents simply coddle their children, which makes them weak
and dependent on others. If the parents are strongly prejudiced in
favour of their children, the children will become demanding and
spoiled. They will expect others to please them, and they will be unable
to sympathize with other people. Indeed, equanimity is the driving force
in spiritual development, particularly in regard to intelligence,
fortitude, skill, and a sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>Although it is both normal and necessary for parents to apply equanimity
when raising their children, they are often not aware of this quality
and do not know how to benefit from it in the maximum way. Take for
example a mother who loves her infant son dearly and nurses and feeds
him. Yet in order for the child to grow up, it is appropriate for him to
learn how to use a spoon, a fork, a bowl, etc., and to be able to look
after himself. One day the mother knows that it is time for the child to
learn how to feed himself. She teaches him how to use a spoon and lets
him learn from trial and error. She lets go and observes his progress.
She repeats a similar lesson for peeling a banana or peeling an apple.
This is equanimity.</p>
<p>Parents then ask themselves: ’What should our children be able to do?
What skills should they master?’ They continue to apply equanimity, by
presenting their children with tasks or challenges and offering advice.
They then let go, observing how their children stand on their own feet.
Eventually, the children become proficient in many areas.</p>
<p>If parents only express kindness and compassion, their children will
tend to remain passive; if they combine these qualities with equanimity,
their children will become observant and industrious. {1111} When
parents express only kindness and compassion, they experience the
immediate and temporary satisfaction of seeing their children happy, but
if they can also apply equanimity, their happiness will be long-lasting,
because they will witness their children’s ongoing progress and success.
Parenting is a model example of how to develop happiness on a social
level. Parents, and other leaders and guides in society, need to
cultivate these four divine abidings, in particular the factor of
equanimity.</p>
<p>Equanimity calls for truth and correctness. It encompasses a desire for
our loved ones to be established in rectitude, righteousness, and
impeccability. This is a supreme form of desire, and when this desire is
fulfilled, one experiences a profound and abiding happiness. When
individual homes and families live happily and are established in
righteous principles, they act as core units for helping to create
prosperous, happy, and civilized societies.</p>
<h3 id="developing-sense-desire-from-competition-to-cooperation"><a class="header" href="#developing-sense-desire-from-competition-to-cooperation">Developing Sense Desire: from Competition to Cooperation</a></h3>
<p>In regard to sense desire, which is tied up with selfishness, when
people develop the four divine abidings and their minds begin to radiate
these qualities outward, their selfishness is reduced. They will not be
exclusively caught up in trying to obtain things in order to seek
personal gratification. Now, they also begin to consider the happiness
of others. This wholesome desire – along with the happiness of seeing
others possess attractive physical features, good health, contentment,
etc. – acts as a counterbalance to selfish impulses.</p>
<p>The wish for others to be happy is a form of lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>), a
form of friendship (<em>mitta</em>). The wish for them to be free from
suffering is compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>). Sharing in happiness when others
succeed is appreciative joy (<em>muditā</em>). And when others have the
potential to make mistakes, one wishes for them to abide in
righteousness and correctness; one thus adopts equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>) in
order to safeguard and maintain the truth – the Dhamma. When people are
endowed with these four qualities, their minds are radiant and
expansive, deserving of the title <em>brahma</em> (’divine’, ’elevated’,
’sublime’). Their happiness will increase, and, importantly, this
happiness will be shared by others.</p>
<p>If one simply remains at the level of sense desire, one’s happiness will
surely be competitive. If I win something, you must lose, or you must do
without. If you seize something, I go without. If I derive happiness, he
derives none, or else he suffers, and vice versa. In sum, one vies for
happiness; one does not share one’s happiness.</p>
<p>This is one crucial disadvantage of sensual or material pleasure. The
reason the world is so troubled, so full of oppression, brutality, and
killing, is because of this scramble for sense pleasure. As a response,
people need to develop themselves in order to reduce the dangers of
sense pleasure and increase the blessings of higher forms of happiness.</p>
<p>The happiness of the four divine abidings is shared. When others
experience happiness, we too are happy. A mother is not happy until her
children are happy; once they are happy, she too is happy. This is a
shared, collective happiness. {1112} Here, one has developed happiness
to another level, to social happiness. One has graduated from a
competitive form of happiness, where everyone simply fends for himself
and vies for limited objects, to a shared, collective happiness. This is
also a crucial stage for ethics, helping to promote true peace in the
world.</p>
<p>The Buddha gave great emphasis to developing social happiness,
especially in the context of the four divine abidings. The four divine
abidings help in developing the quality of one’s mind, but for real
success one needs to also practise the four ’bases of social solidarity’
(<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>) and the six ’virtues conducive to communal life’
(<em>sārāṇīya-dhamma</em>).</p>
<p>Because the management of sense desire is linked to the development of
social happiness, it needs to be included in this discussion. The Buddha
encouraged people to manage sense desire in a correct, righteous
fashion, free from harm. At the very least one should minimize the
dangers of sense desire, and use it in positive, beneficial ways.</p>
<p>The Buddha acknowledged that sense pleasure is a form of happiness. He
went on to say that it has advantages (<em>assāda</em>) and disadvantages
(<em>ādīnava</em>), and that there exists a way out (<em>nissaraṇa</em>) or a solution
to sense pleasure (i.e. a way to escape from its disadvantages). Indeed,
the escape from sense desire is precisely the development of higher
forms of happiness, beginning with the development of social happiness.
There is no problem here if one still delights in sense pleasure. Along
with the restraint of keeping the five precepts, the cultivation of
social happiness prevents people from getting overly caught up with
themselves and from competing with others. Instead, there will be more
mutual assistance and cooperation. At the same time, people will
experience another form of happiness which is more stable and enduring
than sense pleasure.</p>
<p>Many people are unaware that the habitual pursuit of personal
gratification eventually leads to being more susceptible to suffering.
And this susceptibility to suffering fosters an inclination to suffer.</p>
<p>Let us return to the subject of shared happiness. To begin with, when
one sees others happy and well, one shares in their happiness, a feeling
referred to as lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>). Next, one wishes for others to
be free from suffering and cured from illness, and one shares in their
happiness when they escape from these problems; this is referred to as
compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>). Compassion has other, additional benefits.</p>
<p>Imagine that one falls ill and experiences great discomfort. If one is
preoccupied with one’s own problems, thinking, ’Why must this happen to
me?’ the suffering will be even more intense. Some may even think, ’Let
others suffer from this disease instead – why does it have to be me?’
These kinds of thoughts only increase the suffering.</p>
<p>If one is endowed with compassion, when facing illness, one will not
brood over one’s own problems. Rather, one will consider other human
beings, thinking: ’Here I am faced with this illness and experience
great discomfort. Yet there are other people in the world who are poor
and destitute, who have no friends or relatives, who have no money to
buy medicine or nurses to care for them. What must it be like for them?
Yes, it’s true that I am very ill, but I have friends and relatives to
care for me, and doctors who are attending on me. At least I have
adequate food and shelter. Think of the suffering for those people who
are ill and who lack all these things?’ By thinking in this way the
severity of one’s own illness is reduced. The fact that one is sick will
lessen in importance. It may even happen that one does not feel the
discomfort any longer. {1113}</p>
<p>When one is able to further develop compassionate thoughts, one’s
illness becomes a reminder; one thinks: ’Were I not to have this
illness, I probably would have forgotten to take into consideration
those other people who suffer from illness. Now that I am reminded, how
can I offer them assistance?’ This is how illness reminds us to help
those numerous people who are destitute and hardpressed, who have no
friends or relatives, or people to care for them. They need our help to
be freed from affliction. Illness is an impetus for compassion. Besides
spurring us to look for ways to help others, our own suffering will be
abated and sometimes even disappear. One’s own illness will lose its
significance.</p>
<p>The divine abidings are vital. They do not simply remain as passive
emotions in the mind, but actively bear fruit in far-reaching ways. The
Buddha stressed their cultivation, and the source or root of this
spiritual development is wholesome desire (<em>chanda</em>). In this chapter
the focus has been on wholesome desire in a social context, as one way
of describing the importance of this spiritual factor.</p>
<p>Besides teaching people how to manage sense desire, which has the
potential to create intense suffering, one also needs to encourage
people to develop social happiness, by having them cultivate wholesome
desire in respect to others through kindness, compassion, appreciative
joy, and equanimity. In this way people will share their happiness with
others, and they will be impelled to offer mutual assistance. At the
very least, it will help to offset and reduce the harmful effects of
sense desire.</p>
<h3 id="joy-leads-to-spiritual-growth"><a class="header" href="#joy-leads-to-spiritual-growth">Joy Leads to Spiritual Growth</a></h3>
<p>The third kind of happiness referred to above is the happiness in
spiritual development. This kind of happiness is generated from within
an individual. It arises simultaneously with the overall development of
one’s life, and it accompanies progress in Dhamma practice. The
development of the body, moral conduct, the mind, and wisdom may be
referred to as spiritual cultivation or Dhamma practice. When this
development progresses, one experiences this spiritual happiness.</p>
<p>The Buddha gave a teaching on five factors of happiness in spiritual
development, which are collectively given the unusual name of
’concentration of the Dhamma’ (<em>dhamma-samādhi</em>). Although this group is
not exclusively referred to as ’happiness’ (<em>sukha</em>), happiness is one
of the factors. Moreover, all of the other factors are attributes of
happiness and are connected with happiness. Since our present discussion
is on happiness, we can thus refer to this group as ’factors of
happiness’.</p>
<p>The five factors contained in this group refer to specific mind states,
which can be called ’happy mind states’ (<em>sukha-bhāva</em>). The Buddha
repeatedly stressed that someone whose Dhamma practice bears fruit will
grow in these five qualities. Conversely, if someone practises the
Dhamma, yet these five qualities fail to arise, there will be no hope of
true success. {1114} One example the Buddha gave is of someone who
listens to the Dhamma and then investigates it. If he or she practises
correctly, wisdom deepens and these five mind states arise.</p>
<p>Similar to social happiness, these five factors of happiness in
spiritual development are based on wholesome enthusiasm (<em>chanda</em>), and
they unfold in an ordered sequence. But they are not expressed
outwardly; they exist as direct and immediate attributes of the mind.
These factors are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Joy (<em>pāmojja</em>): cheerfulness; gladness. This is a fundamental
attribute of the mind, which people should sustain at all times. In
the Dhammapada it states:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Full of joy,<br />
confident in the Buddha’s teaching,<br />
A bhikkhu will attain the peaceful state,<br />
The stilling of formations, the bliss [supreme].</p>
<p><em>Pāmojjabahulo bhikkhu pasanno buddhasāsane adhigacche padaṃ
santaṃ saṅkhārūpasamaṃ sukhaṃ.</em></p>
<p><em>Dh. verse 381.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Another verse describes a monk who has practised well and correctly,
and ends:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Full of joy,<br />
He will make an end of suffering.</p>
<p><em>Tato pāmojjabahulo dukkhassantaṃ karissati.</em></p>
<p><em>Dh. verse 376.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Joy is a vital innate quality, indicating that one is progressing in
spiritual practice and has the potential to develop further. When
one is full of joy, it is possible to realize Nibbāna, or one is
close to Nibbāna.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delight (<em>pīti</em>): bliss; rapture. With joy, there is delight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tranquillity (<em>passaddhi</em>): serenity; calm; physical and mental
relaxation. This factor acts as the link between the body and mind.
If the body is tense, the mind is tense; if the mind is stressed,
the body is stressed. With delight, there is tranquillity and
relaxation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness (<em>sukha</em>): sense of mental refreshment; ease; absence of
affliction and stress. With the arising of tranquillity, there is
happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concentration (<em>samādhi</em>): one-pointedness of mind; steadiness of
mind; absence of mental disturbance; attention rests on a chosen
object as desired. With the arising of happiness, there is the
potential for concentration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Concentration acts as the link to wisdom; it prepares the mind for the
effective application of wisdom. And when wisdom is developed, every
other aspect of spiritual development is optimized and progresses
smoothly. The presence of these five factors is crucial to the spiritual
development of human beings. When people are endowed with these factors
their education and work proceeds effectively, and their entire Dhamma
practice is steady and reliable.</p>
<p>If people practise incorrectly, the opposite qualities, like trouble and
stress, arise. There is then an absence of joy, delight, tranquillity,
and happiness, and the mind remains scattered. One then experiences
inner disturbance and obstruction. The mind is imbalanced and
ill-at-ease. The result is a lack of progress or success. {1115}</p>
<p>If one possesses these five complementary factors, they will
automatically be integrated with spiritual qualities connected to
society, in particular the four divine abidings. When one generates
lovingkindness towards others, one engages in self-development. The
performing of benevolent deeds is simultaneously a way to practise the
Dhamma within oneself. By acting kindly, one develops spiritually. At
the same time, by radiating a sense of lovingkindness, joy arises
within. Joy is then followed by the other qualities, for example of
delight.</p>
<p>Similarly, when one compassionately aids someone who is suffering, once
that person is healthy and at ease, one experiences delight, which is
then followed by other qualities, including happiness.</p>
<p>If one is continually cheerful, relaxed, and calm, wherever one goes one
enhances one’s social environment. Whomever one meets and speaks to
feels at ease, and shares in one’s happiness. One thus induces happiness
and engenders spiritual qualities in others. One supports others’
spiritual development.</p>
<p>When one walks on the correct path, these positive factors arise in a
natural sequence; they are all interconnected; they are all aspects of
happiness.</p>
<p>A simple method of Dhamma practice is thus to maintain one’s mind in a
state of cheerfulness. Ideally, one combines this with lovingkindness.
Although it may not be one’s intention, one’s complexion will appear
pleasing and attractive to others. One will have many cooperative and
helpful friends, one will live with others in peace, one’s community
will prosper, and one’s work will reach success.</p>
<p>Here, let us compare these three kinds of happiness: sense pleasure,
social happiness, and happiness of spiritual development.</p>
<p>Sense pleasure is derived from external, material things, obtained for
one’s own personal benefit. Each separate individual desires or covets
these things, and thus sense desire breeds competition and conflict. It
therefore requires caution and constraint. The purpose of the five
precepts is to regulate sense desire, to manage the pursuit and
consumption of material things, and to prevent people from creating an
excessive amount of trouble and oppression for each other. However much
people consume or contest for material things, one can wish that it does
not reach the extent that the world becomes engulfed in flames. The five
precepts exist as a reminder that sense desire requires supervision and
restraint.</p>
<p>Social happiness is generated by providing happiness to others and to
society. It stems from a heart of lovingkindness and compassion – the
desire to see others at ease – and is thus a shared, mutual happiness.
The five happiness factors of spiritual development, beginning with joy,
arise from within a person and have no negative effects on others. They
may arise by doing good to others, and they are the starting point of
spreading goodness outwards. So although it is an internal, personal
happiness, it brings about a connection with others. It fosters virtue
and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>The latter two kinds of happiness cause no harm. Rather, they are
supportive to both the individual and to society. They help people to
mitigate the harm from pursuing sense pleasure, and they introduce
people to a way of enjoying sense pleasure promoting mutual wellbeing.
Moreover, they bring a refinement to people’s lives, and provide people
with a way out leading to higher levels of spiritual development. These
two kinds of happiness should thus be given great emphasis. {1116}</p>
<h3 id="a-cultivated-mind-is-easily-content"><a class="header" href="#a-cultivated-mind-is-easily-content">A Cultivated Mind Is Easily Content</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, sense pleasure is the most important matter for
ordinary human beings. But, because it involves vying with other people,
one must manage it well and practise restraint. The five precepts were
established in order to ensure that the pursuit of sense pleasure and
consumption of desirable objects remains within proper boundaries.
However much one seeks pleasure and competes with others, don’t let it
be a cause for severe trouble, to the extent that the world enters an
era of oppression.</p>
<p>When human beings are established in the five precepts, society is
relatively stable, but this is no guarantee that people will be very
happy. To improve the life of individuals and society, people must
develop themselves further. This is the purpose of the eight precepts.</p>
<p>After one has sought pleasure by relying on external material things for
seven or eight days, one sets aside one day in order to live more simply
and to reduce one’s dependency on these things. The time one normally
uses to gratify one’s own desires, one uses for other objectives, by
keeping the eight precepts on the observance day (<em>uposatha</em>), which
falls on either the eighth or fifteenth day of the waxing moon, or the
eighth, fourteenth, or fifteenth day of the waning moon, i.e. about four
times per month.</p>
<p>The five precepts focus on the non-harming of other people. In the eight
precepts, the third precept is changed to abstaining from sexual
activity, and three additional precepts are added. Both the variation on
the third precept and the additional three precepts are matters
concerning the individual; they do not directly pertain to other people.
The three additional precepts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>6th precept: to refrain from eating at the ’improper time’, that is,
after midday; on this day one need not pander to the tongue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7th precept: to refrain from singing, dancing, music, and various
forms of entertainment that please the eye and ear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8th precept: to abstain from indulging in the pleasures of tactile
sensation derived from lying on soft and luxuriant mattresses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One day each week is reserved for self-training. It is an easy method of
developing happiness independent of external things.</p>
<p>Although the Buddha acknowledged that seeking pleasure from material
things is a personal matter, he said that if people are not careful,
their happiness will become dependent on these things. Eventually, no
amount of these things will suffice to provide them with happiness. They
will keep trying to acquire more until they end up oppressing others. To
maintain one’s independence, one thus needs to train oneself.</p>
<p>One may have pampered oneself with good food and delicious flavours for
seven days. On the eighth day, one practises by applying the sixth
precept, in order to see whether one can still be happy without
following the desires of the palate. {1131} Instead of delicious tastes,
one now emphasizes physical health and quality of life. Rather than
following the desires of the palate, one eats just enough to sustain the
body.</p>
<p>The same goes for the eyes and ears. For seven days one entertains
oneself by way of sights and sounds. On the eighth day one applies the
seventh precept and learns to live without these amusements. One uses
one’s time instead for other purposes, for instance by practising
meditation, assisting other people, or benefiting society.</p>
<p>One may normally sleep on a thick and comfortable mattress. On the
eighth day one experiments by sleeping on a thin mat, to see if one can
be happy without relying on these comforts.</p>
<p>By keeping these precepts, people are more vigilant and avoid an
over-dependence on and indulgence in material things. Such a training in
virtuous conduct makes people easily happy, not prone to suffering, and
mentally strong. It is conducive to the further development of
happiness; it is the link to mental development and wisdom development.</p>
<p>One may wish to verify or determine to what extent one’s happiness is
independent of material things. To do this, consider the following kinds
of people:</p>
<p>Many people abandon themselves to the pursuit of sense pleasure. They
must eat delicious food, entertain themselves with various amusements,
e.g. television, and sleep in luxurious beds. And they are continually
in search of more of these things and more exceptional things.
Eventually their happiness becomes dependent on these things, which
become indispensable. They are not able to live contentedly by
themselves, because the only channel for accessing happiness is by way
of these material things.</p>
<p>Some people’s happiness is completely tied up with these gratifying
sense objects. If they have to do without, they become agitated,
thinking: ’I must have these things; otherwise I’ll die.’ In this case,
they have utterly lost their independence.</p>
<p>Those people who train themselves by way of the eight precepts, however,
are able to live simply and find it easier to access happiness. They
gradually become more self-reliant and flexible, and thus maintain their
independence. In regard to gratifying sense objects, they will say: ’I
can take them or leave them. If I have them I’m comfortable, but I can
live without them. Even if I must lay on a mat or on a wooden floor, I
can sleep.’ Moreover, they are less likely to suffer chronic back pain.
(Some people with chronic back pain are ordered by their doctors to
sleep on the floor!)</p>
<p>Later, one may gain a new level of proficiency. One will recognize that
these fancy and extravagant things are unnecessary. {1132} In reference
to these things, one will say, ’I can take them or leave them’, or even,
’If I have them it’s okay, but it’s fine not to have them, because I’ll
have more freedom and independence.’</p>
<p>Already an initial training in these matters will bring about greater
independence, enabling us to use our time more beneficially and to find
it easier to experience happiness. We will be able to derive an adequate
and ample value from sense objects; we won’t be driven to increase the
quantity or degree of these things, while our level of happiness remains
the same.</p>
<p>While dwelling alone one is able to experience happiness. If one
encounters pleasurable sense objects, one engages with them with wise
discernment. They may supplement one’s already existing happiness.
Simply beware that these things do not become essential for one’s
happiness, otherwise one will lose one’s independence.</p>
<p>In reference to the observance days (<em>uposatha</em>), the Buddha encouraged
people to use the time they would normally be seeking pleasurable sense
experiences to engage in beneficial activities (<em>anavajja-kamma</em>). When
one is not devoted to ministering to one’s own personal pleasures, one
is left with a lot of free time. On the observance days one can use this
spare time for wholesome purposes, say by seeking knowledge, reading
Dhamma books, teaching children, meditating, helping orphans, or
visiting the elderly.</p>
<p>This is another stage of spiritual practice. When you have the
opportunity, try and keep the Uposatha precepts once every eight days.
They are not that difficult and their benefits are great. They help
maintain one’s independence, enable one to live happily with few
material possessions, are conducive to meditation and good health,
enhance the quality of one’s life, and provide one with extra time to
engage in wholesome activities.</p>
<h3 id="happiness-of-giving-leads-to-peace-in-society"><a class="header" href="#happiness-of-giving-leads-to-peace-in-society">Happiness of Giving Leads to Peace in Society</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Buddha gave great importance to social
happiness. The focus so far has been on internal spiritual qualities, by
demonstrating how people’s wholesome mind states are connected to and
have an effect on social happiness. The discussion has shown how
people’s happiness has many aspects, one of which is happiness on a
social level. To complete this discussion, we need to also look at those
principles pertaining to a more active engagement in society.</p>
<p>We can begin by asking the question: ’When someone feels kindness and
wishes to make others happy, or feels compassion and wishes for others
to be freed from suffering, what is the most fundamental expression of
these wholesome mind states?’ This is connected to a related question:
’What quality did the Buddha most often speak about in relation to
householders?’ The answer is ’giving’ (<em>dāna</em>), that is, generosity.</p>
<p>Buddhism begins with generosity. The Buddha presented a threefold
practice for laypeople called the three bases of meritorious action
(<em>puññakiriyā-vatthu</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn78">78</a></sup> which is paired with the threefold training
of the monastic community. Simply speaking, the threefold training
(<em>tisso sikkhā</em>) is the practice for the monks and nuns, while the three
bases of meritorious action – of generosity (<em>dāna</em>), moral conduct
(<em>sīla</em>), and spiritual cultivation (<em>bhāvanā</em>) – comprise the practice
for laypeople.</p>
<p>The first factor of meritorious action is generosity (<em>dāna</em>). In all
the important groups taught by the Buddha of spiritual qualities
pertaining to the general public, generosity is always the first factor.
What does this term ’giving’ (<em>dāna</em>) imply? It implies that, generally
speaking for the average person, the pursuit, possession, division, and
consumption of material things are the most predominant activities, the
main issues in people’s lives. Of all these activities dealing with
material things, they merge at the activity of consumption.</p>
<p>What is the basic line of thinking, the basic mental preoccupation, for
most people? Due to the pressure of wanting to survive, people struggle
to obtain things for themselves. This repeated thought pattern of trying
to get things, to obtain things, eventually becomes habitual; it becomes
an underlying tendency of the mind. Yet the pursuit, acquisition, and
accumulation of things is relentless; people generally do not know what
is enough. Moreover, material things are limited in number, giving rise
to competition and oppression, which escalates until the whole world is
in conflict.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem begins with giving, with generosity. At the
very least generosity should be used to offset acquisitive tendencies,
but if possible, one should embed this quality as a habit, as a natural
disposition of the mind. If one only thinks about acquiring things, one
will end up exploiting others and one will experience inner turmoil. To
balance the act of acquisition it is thus essential to also practise
generosity. {1117} Sharing with others is thus paired with the pursuit,
acquisition, and consumption of things for one’s own personal benefit.
It is considered the fundamental spiritual quality for laypeople and for
the wellbeing of human society.</p>
<p>Generosity acts as a foundation for developing higher spiritual
qualities. The three bases of meritorious action (<em>puññakiriyā-vatthu</em>)
provide a broad outline of such development, as generosity, moral
conduct, and cultivation of the mind. When the Buddha taught laypeople
whose knowledge of Dhamma was still at a beginning level, he would
generally lay a gradual foundation by teaching what is referred to as
the fivefold ’progressive instruction’ (<em>anupubbikathā</em>). This teaching
begins with generosity (<em>dāna</em>), which is then followed by talk on
morality (<em>sīla-kathā</em>), talk on heavenly pleasures (<em>sagga-kathā</em>), the
disadvantages of sensual pleasures (<em>kāmādīnava</em>), and the benefits of
renunciation (<em>nekkhammānisaṁsa</em>).</p>
<p>Generosity is part of the four ’principles of service’
(<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>), the virtues making for social integration:
generosity (<em>dāna</em>), kindly speech (<em>piya-vācā</em>), acts of service
(<em>atthacariyā</em>), and even and equal treatment of others (<em>samānattatā</em>).</p>
<p>Generosity is the first factor in the ten royal virtues
(<em>dasarāja-dhamma</em>; virtues of a ruler): generosity (<em>dāna</em>), moral
conduct (<em>sīla</em>), self-sacrifice (<em>pariccāga</em>), integrity (<em>ājjava</em>),
gentleness (<em>maddava</em>), self-control (<em>tapa</em>), non-anger (<em>akkodha</em>),
non-violence (<em>avihiṁsā</em>), patience (<em>khanti</em>), and conformity to
righteousness (<em>avirodhana</em>).</p>
<p>Generosity is even the first factor in the ten perfections (<em>pāramī</em>),
the virtues perfected by bodhisattas: generosity (<em>dāna</em>), moral conduct
(<em>sīla</em>), renunciation (<em>nekkhamma</em>), wisdom (<em>paññā</em>), effort
(<em>viriya</em>), patience (<em>khanti</em>), honesty (<em>sacca</em>), determination
(<em>adhiṭṭhāna</em>), lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>), and equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>).
Generosity is the first factor in several other groups of spiritual
qualities. Its importance is obvious. Even if one is starving and close
to death, it is generosity that may save one’s life.</p>
<p>Generosity helps to alleviate suffering and generates happiness in
societies that are competitive or oppressive due to the pursuit of
personal pleasures. Besides its own inherent benefits, generosity is
also a supporting factor for other qualities, including moral conduct
(<em>sīla</em>). The sharing of material things makes it easier for people to
maintain virtuous conduct. On a basic level, when people receive things
from others, they are less likely to try and seize them through unlawful
means.</p>
<p>People have varying degrees of moral steadfastness. Some people will not
steal from others if they are not truly in need, but if they are
destitute they may revert to stealing as a way to survive. Generosity,
say in the form of charity, can help this situation. (Of course, there
are some people who have a very weak immunity to immoral behaviour and
will try to seize things from others whenever they feel the slightest
need. In such cases, one may need to come up with other ways to address
this problem.) In any case, when there is mutual sharing and caring, the
incidents involving theft and violation of others’ property will
diminish. Generosity thus helps to protect moral standards in society.</p>
<p>Generosity is also a support for the cultivation of the mind. Even those
practitioners who develop tranquillity and insight meditation
(<em>samatha-vipassanā</em>) prize the value of generosity. The Buddha stated
how, in the context of tranquillity and insight meditation, generosity
is both an ’adornment of the mind’ (<em>cittālaṅkāra</em>) and an
’embellishment of the mind’ (<em>citta-parikkhāra</em>). {1118}</p>
<p>The practice of generosity and self-sacrifice helps to enhance and
beautify the mind. It makes the mind receptive, obliging, and intent on
goodness. It fortifies the mind, integrates wholesome intentions, and
prepares the mind for relinquishment. It makes the mind clear, spacious,
relaxed, and bright. It is conducive to concentration, to mental
purification, and to higher spiritual states. The delight and happiness
of generosity alone is greatly beneficial to one’s meditation, to the
development of tranquillity and insight. For this reason, laypeople who
have reached a level of awakening are still dedicated to the act of
giving and sharing.</p>
<p>The term <em>dāna</em> encompasses a wide range of meanings, including:
’generosity’, ’charity’, ’liberality’, ’open-handedness’, and
’hospitality’. As mentioned earlier, it is the basis for a happy,
harmonious society. Generosity is of key significance in Buddhism, both
in the Buddhist teachings and in Buddhist history. Here, in the Buddhist
country of Thailand, one can observe that Thai people give easily,
relinquish things easily, and are charitable by nature.</p>
<p>Giving needs to be done correctly and carefully, however. It needs to be
accompanied by wise reflection, by taking precautions against harmful
side effects. Moreover, it needs to be integrated with other aspects of
spiritual practice. One shouldn’t think: ’I have reached the stage of
meditation; I no longer need to participate in giving.’ This is
incorrect. Generosity supports meditation practice. As mentioned above,
it acts as an adornment for the mind, enabling one’s tranquillity and
insight meditation to bear fruit.</p>
<h3 id="sharing-of-material-gains-within-the-monastic-community"><a class="header" href="#sharing-of-material-gains-within-the-monastic-community">Sharing of Material Gains within the Monastic Community</a></h3>
<p>So far the emphasis has been on the lay community; let us turn our
attention to the monastic community. Do not believe that the life of the
monastic community, of the monks, revolves only around formal meditation
practice.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn79">79</a></sup> The terms ’meditation’ or ’Dhamma practice’ can either be
given a too narrow definition, or else their definitions are vague and
ambiguous, to the point that one sometimes needs to avoid these terms or
to use them with care. In fact, every valid activity of a monk can be
described as ’Dhamma practice’, and anyone – monk or layperson – who
engages in proper ’giving’ (<em>dāna</em>) need accord with this principle of
Dhamma practice.</p>
<p>By examining the monks’ life in relation to the formal discipline
(Vinaya), one sees how this life is communal, and one also sees how it
is distinguished from lay-life. The communal life of a monk, which is
guided by the formal discipline, is at heart connected to essential
Dhamma principles, because the gist of the Vinaya corresponds to the
Dhamma – to principles or teachings of truth. Yet this connection needs
to be discerned accurately. The communal life of the monks is based on
harmony, which is generated and sustained by way of the formal
discipline. As soon as we focus here on harmony, we have immediately
linked up with the Dhamma. At this point we can look at those principles
which act as a foundation for harmony.</p>
<p>A repeated teaching in both the Suttanta Piṭaka and the Vinaya Piṭika is
that on the six virtues conducive to communal life (<em>sārāṇīya-dhamma</em>),
which are applied directly for sustaining the stability of the monastic
community. {1119} This is a teaching for practical application. For
example, one accesses the internal spiritual virtue of lovingkindness
and expresses it outwardly in daily life. These six virtues are given
great importance in the context of monastic community life. Let us
review these factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Physical acts of lovingkindness (<em>mettā-kāyakamma</em>): acting out of
mutual consideration and cooperation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verbal acts of lovingkindness (<em>mettā-vacīkamma</em>): speaking out of
kindness and well-wishing. For example, one advises and offers
instruction by using polite and courteous speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinking of others with lovingkindness (<em>mettā-manokamma</em>):
maintaining thoughts of well-wishing and concern for others;
remaining in good spirits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sharing of gains (<em>sādhāraṇabhogī</em> or <em>sādhāraṇabhogitā</em>):
sharing one’s material gains, say of requisites or food, with others
so that everyone can partake of them. (<em>Sādhāraṇabhogī</em> literally
means eating or consuming things as public, common goods, for the
benefit of all.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping equal moral standards (<em>sīla-sāmaññatā</em>): keeping equal
standards in light of the formal rules of conduct (Vinaya);
refraining from making oneself objectionable or disagreeable to
one’s community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being endowed with right views along with one’s companions
(<em>diṭṭhi-sāmaññatā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To return to the subject of generosity, one may ask, since monks do not
earn a livelihood, do not seek or accumulate material things, and do not
own wealth or property, how are they able to give? Here, we won’t
discuss the ’gift of Dhamma’ (<em>dhamma-dāna</em>), which in reference to
monks is often paired with the material gifts (<em>vatthu-dāna</em>;
<em>āmisa-dāna</em>) by laypeople. In regard to monks and material things,
generosity or the act of giving is represented by the fourth factor of
the virtues conducive to communal life above, namely, the sharing of
gains (<em>sādhāraṇabhogī</em>).</p>
<p>If one overlooks a study of the formal discipline (Vinaya), one will not
appreciate the importance that Buddhism gives to people’s relationship
to material things. In the context of monastic life, the Buddha gave
great emphasis to the sharing of material requisites. The Vinaya
contains key principles and guidelines for sharing gains in a righteous
and thorough way. Besides focusing on these matters of material gain,
the Vinaya also addresses a system of communal living. Indeed, the
sharing of gains is an aspect of communal life. And as stated earlier,
the Vinaya is linked with the Dhamma at the principle of social harmony
(<em>sāmaggī</em>), which ensures social stability and happiness.</p>
<p>If one is to truly understand Buddhism, one’s focus should not simply be
on the Dhamma teachings, which emphasize spiritual qualities. Buddhism
is not merely a collection of Dhamma teachings. It also includes the
Vinaya, which address social issues and material concerns. By having a
more comprehensive overview, one will get to the heart of the term
’Dhammavinaya’. {1120}</p>
<h3 id="goodness-in-peoples-hearts-actively-supports-society"><a class="header" href="#goodness-in-peoples-hearts-actively-supports-society">Goodness in People’s Hearts Actively Supports Society</a></h3>
<p>Both in respect to the monastic community and to the lay community, the
basic foundation for social happiness rests with the same group of
spiritual qualities: lovingkindness (<em>mettā</em>), compassion (<em>karuṇā</em>),
sympathetic joy (<em>muditā</em>), and equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>) – the four
divine abidings (<em>brahmavihāra</em>). But when establishing a system of
practice in social situations, another set of factors must be defined –
based on the foundation of spiritual qualities above – which can be
applied in the domain of conventional reality.</p>
<p>The six virtues conducive to communal life (<em>sārāṇīya-dhamma</em>) practised
by the monks are based on the four divine abidings. But it is difficult
to establish this same set of six virtues in the context of lay-life.
Take for example the fourth factor, of equally distributing material
gains. This is realistic and achievable in the monastic community, but
very difficult to implement in everyday society. Generally, the best
people can do in this context is to defer to this principle of sharing
everything with others, or else they sidestep the issue altogether. For
this reason, another group of factors was established as a practical
guideline for lay society. If asked what these factors are, I wonder how
many Buddhists are able to answer.</p>
<p>As an aside, I have observed that lay Buddhists are generally not able
to properly distinguish between internal, spiritual factors and
practical principles applied in external, social circumstances. For
example, many people refer to spiritual qualities like lovingkindness
and compassion, and talk about them as if they are principles for
practical application in society. This causes confusion and
misunderstanding for the speaker as well as for others. (See

<blockquote>
<p>Take for example the case of Dr. Joseph L. Sutton from Indiana
University who in 1962 came to work in Thailand. During the time that
the Graduate School of Public Administration was founded at the
National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA), Dr. Sutton
wrote an analysis of Thai society in regard to Buddhism and
development in his book ’Problems of Politics and Administration in
Thailand’ (Bloomington: Institute of Training for Public Service,
Department of Government, Indiana University, 1962).</p>
<p>He cited a passage by Albert Schweitzer stating that in Buddhist
societies benevolent acts do not require any real action at all,
because, according to the Buddhist teachings, all one needs to do is
stay at home and spread thoughts of lovingkindness (here, I am simply
paraphrasing the passage).</p>
<p>Thai people are probably at fault here, by practising incorrectly and
giving Dr. Sutton the impression expressed in this passage. It thus
behooves the Thai people to understand the Buddhist teachings
correctly and to redeem themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>As mentioned above, the six virtues conducive to communal life are based
on the four divine abidings. Yet it is obvious that in this teaching,
lovingkindness is not simply an emotion stored in the heart; rather, it
is applied outwardly as physical acts of lovingkindness
(<em>mettā-kāyakamma</em>; enthusiastic assistance of others), verbal acts of
lovingkindness (<em>mettā-vacīkamma</em>), and thoughts of lovingkindness
(<em>mettā-manokamma</em>). In the context of lay society, the four divine
abidings are expressed as principles of practical application in the
teaching of the four bases of social solidarity (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>).</p>
<p>Earlier we discussed generosity (<em>dāna</em>) in the context of inner
development, as part of the three bases of meritorious action
(<em>puññakiriyā-vatthu</em>). Here, we will discuss generosity in the context
of practical application for householders, as part of the four bases of
social solidarity. {1121}</p>
<p>The four bases of social solidarity (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>; also referred to
as ’principles of service’ or ’virtues making for group integration’)
are applied to external, social situations; they are paired with the
internal, spiritual factors of the four divine abidings:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generosity (<em>dāna</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One gives to others in an ordinary situation, in order to
express one’s love and well-wishing, one’s kindness and
consideration. This is giving with lovingkindness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One gives to others who are distressed or sick, in order to
offer assistance. This is giving with compassion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One gives to others who have performed a benefit to society, for
example to a skilled inventor, in order to offer support and
encouragement. This is giving with appreciative joy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kindly speech (<em>piya-vācā</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One speaks kind, polite, and courteous words in ordinary
situations. This is speech with lovingkindness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One speaks comforting words and offers wise advice when others
are confronted with difficulty. This is speech with compassion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One speaks words of rejoicing and admiration when others perform
good deeds and engage in meritorious, wholesome acts. This is
speech with appreciative joy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acts of service (<em>atthacariyā</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One helps others and provides support, by wishing them well.
These are acts of service with lovingkindness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One helps others, by way of one’s physical efforts or by way of
one’s wisdom and proficiency, to escape from difficulty when
they are faced with hardship and affliction, say from floods and
fires, or a workload exceeding their strength. These are acts of
service with compassion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One helps others when they perform beneficial actions, for
example when they organize an almsgiving ceremony in a
monastery, by lending a hand and encouraging their acts of
goodness. These are acts of service with appreciative joy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even and equal treatment (<em>samānattatā</em>): fair and just treatment of
others. This factor corresponds with equanimity (<em>upekkhā</em>).
Equanimity is expressed by way of this even and equal treatment, by
non-favouritism, by non-discrimination, by refraining from
disparaging or exploiting others, by just behaviour, and by
integrating oneself and living in harmony with others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When one reaches the stage of practical application, one needs to engage
on this level of the four principles of service. One should not simply
recite the four divine abidings in a vague and ambiguous way. Otherwise,
the criticisms, say by the Western author mentioned in the last
footnote, are justified. Rather than condemn the critics, we should
explain to them the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>By practising in accord with these four principles, one fosters
happiness and harmony in one’s community. One helps to create an
environment conducive to each individual’s wellbeing, success, and
development. Moreover, acting in order to benefit society is inherently
a form of self-development. For this reason it is said that serving
others is a form of spiritual practice. By acting in order to benefit
others one automatically benefits and develops oneself. {1122}</p>
<p>Take for example a bodhisatta, who engages in Dhamma practice and
develops the perfections (<em>pāramī</em>) by helping others. Indeed, the very
act of helping others constitutes his or her Dhamma practice. In order
to effectively help others, one must apply wisdom and skill, and be
cultivating an advanced stage of spiritual practice.</p>
<p>By successfully helping others, we ourselves undergo a spiritual
transformation. Our wisdom faculty and other spiritual capabilities are
strengthened. In order to practise the Dhamma correctly, one must thus
accord with two teachings by the Buddha:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, the Buddha presented the pair of factors consisting of
non-harming of oneself and non-harming of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, he taught the pair of factors: attending to personal
wellbeing (<em>attattha</em>) and attending to the wellbeing of others
(<em>parattha</em>). This second teaching less commonly consists of three
factors: self-benefit (<em>attattha</em>), benefit of others (<em>parattha</em>),
and mutual benefit (<em>ubhayattha</em>). These two factors, of attending
to one’s own personal matters and attending to the concerns of
others, are always paired with one another.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mutual-assistance-benefits-everyone"><a class="header" href="#mutual-assistance-benefits-everyone">Mutual Assistance Benefits Everyone</a></h3>
<p>In terms of the monastic community, apart from emphasizing the sharing
of material gains, the Buddha also gave great emphasis to communal
harmony (<em>sāmaggī</em>). This harmony stands in contrast to a schism in the
sangha (<em>saṅgha-bheda</em>), which if created intentionally counts as one of
the five ’crimes bringing about immediate results’ (<em>anantariya-kamma</em>),
the most severe form of evil deed. This reveals the prime importance the
Buddha gave to communal harmony. For the lay community, the Buddha also
emphasized the importance of unity and concord, by maintaining the four
bases of social solidarity (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>).</p>
<p>Of all the Buddha’s male lay disciples who were praised as being
preeminent (<em>etadagga</em>), there are two who stand out as supreme: the
householder Citta, who was foremost at preaching the Dhamma, and
Hatthaka,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn80">80</a></sup> who was foremost at uniting other people.</p>
<p>Hatthaka was proficient at creating communal harmony by way of the four
bases of social solidarity. As a leader he was able to use these four
factors to bring about a firm and stable harmony amongst his community.
The Buddha praised these two individuals as being the standard-bearers
of the Buddhist male lay community. (The female lay community also
contained a pair of supreme disciples who acted as standard-bearers:
Khujjuttarā, who was foremost in great knowledge, and Nandamātā,
foremost in meditative proficiency.)</p>
<p>The reason why I am emphasizing this subject is that contemporary
Buddhists seem to view Buddhism as a matter dealing almost exclusively
with the individual.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn81">81</a></sup> They do not seem to realize the importance the
Buddha gave to communal and social issues. I believe Buddhists need to
establish a more balanced perspective.</p>
<p>In sum, in relation to the monastic community, the Buddha emphasized the
principle of harmony (<em>sāmaggī</em>), while in relation to the lay community
he emphasized the four bases of social solidarity (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>). In
both cases, the focal point is communal harmony. In the case of the
monks and nuns the Buddha spoke in a more general, abstract sense,
whereas in regard to the laity he spoke about material possessions.
Buddhism thus gives great emphasis to communal and social issues, which
are intimately connected to personal issues.</p>
<p>Granted, personal issues are an essential aspect of spiritual practice.
For people to develop spiritually, things must proceed according to laws
of nature pertaining to the individual. {1123} Even on the level of the
body, after swallowing food we must digest it ourselves; no one can help
us to do this. If we are unable to swim, no amount of strident
instructions by another, or even divine intervention, will enable us to
swim. If we are unable to do multiplication, our friends cannot
calculate the answer and beam it into our brains. If we are suffering,
no matter how much others love us, they won’t be able to imbue us with
happiness. And if we lack wisdom, others are unable to infuse us with
it. For this reason, one must be able to rely on oneself; one must train
oneself and cultivate the necessary natural conditions oneself.</p>
<p>Having said this, Buddhism recognizes the well-wishing, support, and
encouragement by others as an essential external condition for people’s
spiritual development. As guides and teachers, wise and well-meaning
people are able to apply social systems to act as a catalyst initiating
natural dynamics within an individual (most notably wise reflection).
Once these dynamics set in, the process of development reaches
fulfilment.</p>
<p>This is how other people are able to help. To begin with they express
kindness and well-wishing, and then they actively assist as an external
influence. For example, a teacher provides instruction to foster wisdom
in his or her pupils, but if the pupils do not wish to learn, the
teaching is in vain. The teacher is unable to automatically transfer
knowledge into the pupils’ minds. The pupils need to combine this
teaching with internal factors. When one knows how to investigate, is
determined to listen, and possesses skilful reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), the information one has learned (referred to as
<em>suta</em>) is transformed into wisdom. The teacher is unable to inject this
wisdom into the student.</p>
<p>I have often pointed out how laypeople go to monks and ask for moral
conduct. They chant: <em>Mayaṃ bhante tisaraṇena saha pañca sīlāni yācāma</em>:
’We request the five precepts.’ Yet the monks reply: ’We are unable to
confer on you moral conduct – this is something you must develop
yourself.’ So what is to be done? The monks know that moral rectitude
arises from proper spiritual practice; it is not something that one
person can give to another. They thus tell the laypeople: ’After
reciting these precepts, go and keep them, go and follow them; true
morality will then arise within you.’</p>
<p>The laypeople ask for morality (<em>sīla</em>) and the monks give them precepts
or training rules (<em>sikkhāpada</em>). They recite: <em>Pāṇātipāta veramaṇī
sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi</em>: ’I undertake the precept of refraining from
harming living creatures,’ etc. By keeping the precepts, morality arises
within the individual. Laypeople may ask for concentration from the
monks, who will reply in a similar way, saying: ’This is not something I
can bestow on you; you must develop it yourself. But I can teach you
meditation techniques for you to practise. By developing these you will
generate concentration.’ The same goes for wisdom. The monks will reply:
’I can’t give you wisdom, but I can share information and teachings for
you to reflect on and investigate. In this way you will generate wisdom
within yourselves.’</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When laypeople ask for morality, the monks give them precepts to
undertake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When laypeople ask for concentration, the monks give them meditation
techniques to develop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When laypeople ask for wisdom, the monks give them teachings to
examine. {1124}</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, spiritual practice vis-à-vis society – acts of service for
one’s community or society – bears two important fruits on the personal
level:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, when one acts for the benefit of society, say by offering
assistance to others, these very actions constitute spiritual
practice – they are an exceptional opportunity for spiritual
practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, by acting in this way one creates a conducive environment
for spiritual practice, which benefits everyone, including oneself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This second factor is very important. If society is filled with turmoil
and oppression, how is one able to practise the Dhamma? Studying,
seeking out books, sitting in meditation – all of these activities are
obstructed. In the monastic community it is essential that the monks
foster peace, harmony, and cooperation, creating a conducive atmosphere
for each individual to engage in Dhamma practice and perform regular
duties conveniently and at ease. A peaceful community enables people to
increase their acts of service for others, which in turn increases the
personal benefits mentioned above, strengthening a wholesome cycle.</p>
<p>Buddhism gives great emphasis to society. When examining Buddhism, one
should not look solely at the Dhamma teachings; rather, one should also
investigate the formal discipline – the Vinaya. Moreover, there are
distinct spiritual factors which help to bridge the Dhamma and the
Vinaya, and which are highlighted in regard to one’s relationship to
society and to the material world.</p>
<p>When one performs good deeds for society with a mind of kindness and
compassion, one experiences joy and delight. One thus obtains a vital
spiritual factor. When one witnesses someone become freed from
suffering, one’s joy increases. By helping others, one’s society becomes
more joyous and one’s own happiness grows, which is conducive to other
spiritual factors.</p>
<p>In this context, bear in mind these two groups of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In relation to society, one applies the four bases of social
solidarity (<em>saṅgaha-vatthu</em>), which are based on the four divine
abidings of lovingkindness, compassion, appreciative joy, and
equanimity. The four bases of solidarity create a collective
happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In relation to the individual, one is endowed with the five factors
constituting ’concentration of the Dhamma’ (<em>dhamma-samādhi</em>): joy,
delight, tranquillity, happiness, and concentration. These factors
facilitate spiritual practice and act as internal ’assets’ or a
personal ’capital’. In particular, one should try and foster the
first factor of <em>pāmojja</em>: joy, cheerfulness, gladness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Awakened beings, including stream-enterers, act as exemplars in this
context. The Buddha described how noble beings maintain both personal
happiness and social happiness. He compared stream-enterers, who
diligently attend to both their individual practice and to communal
activities and helping others, with a mother cow, who while grazing
looks over her shoulder to look after her calf, checking to see that it
is getting enough to eat:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, just as a cow with a young calf, while she grazes watches her
calf, so too, that is the character of a person who is accomplished in
right view (i.e. a stream-enterer). Indeed, a noble disciple attends
earnestly to those necessary affairs concerning his companions in the
holy life, yet he is [also] ardently attentive to the training in
higher morality, the training in higher mind, and the training in
higher wisdom.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 324.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha wished for people to behave in a similar way as these
stream-enterers. {1125}</p>
<h3 id="the-wise-learn-from-suffering"><a class="header" href="#the-wise-learn-from-suffering">The Wise Learn from Suffering</a></h3>
<p>It is now time to reiterate the advantages and disadvantages of
happiness. But before we do, let me say some more about suffering,
because one must pass beyond suffering in order to reach happiness, and
suffering too has advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>People dislike suffering because it is oppressive, stifling, troubling,
and frustrating. This is the very definition of suffering, and so it’s
normal that people find it displeasurable. A person endowed with wise
reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), however, is able to benefit from
suffering. How so? When people are oppressed by suffering and feel
frustrated, they struggle to escape. If they know how to strive
correctly, however, besides increasing the likelihood of successfully
escaping the suffering, the very endeavour makes them strong, provides
them with valuable life experiences, and is conducive to spiritual
growth on many levels. If people are able to reflect wisely and develop
the proper relationship to suffering, they will prosper. But if they
deal with suffering incorrectly, besides remaining caught up in it, they
will aggravate the situation.</p>
<p>Take for example someone who is born poor or destitute. If he is unable
to reflect on his situation wisely, but instead sits around miserable,
depressed, and despairing, he simply exacerbates the suffering and sinks
deeper into misfortune. If he responds to the situation correctly,
however, strives to rectify it, and reflects wisely, he is able to
overcome that suffering and may even reach great success.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the struggle to escape from suffering becomes established
as a social system. Take for example the system of market-economy
competition which is spreading from the West and becoming the dominant
worldwide economic system, as part of what we call ’globalization’. This
system of competition compels people to struggle with the pressures of
suffering. It is strongly connected to the doctrine of ’every man for
himself’ or the system of individualism. As one struggles, without being
able to rely on anyone else for help, one must be fiercely determined
and generate energy. This makes people strong, proactive, and constantly
ambitious.</p>
<p>A certain diligence and vigilance is required to succeed in this system,
which results in progress. A deeper analysis of how desirable this
progress is, or what pros and cons this system of competition has, will
have to wait for another time. In any case, the diligence arising from
the pressure of this competitive system is not true diligence, because
it is simply a reaction and struggle against a feeling of coercion. It
is not diligence stemming from wisdom, and it leaves many problems in
its wake, both personal, e.g. stress, and social, e.g. the absence of
relationships based on friendliness and goodwill. Many of these problems
consequently require great effort to solve. Having said this, a diligent
and vigilant person is still better than someone wallowing in
heedlessness and indulgence.</p>
<p>Occasionally, leaders in society must apply, or even generate, this kind
of pseudo-diligence in order to rouse people from their slumber. This is
better than allowing them to sink into heedlessness, curl up in
depression, or be at a complete loss over what to do.</p>
<p>People should learn how to benefit from suffering. When afflicted by
suffering, they will then make effort and grow strong. And they will
look for skilful ways to solve problems, to free themselves from
suffering. The attempt to free oneself from suffering is an opportunity
to develop oneself spiritually. First and foremost, one develops wisdom.
By the time one has solved a problem and passed beyond it, one’s wisdom
is sharper. All aspects of one’s life will be developed and become more
proficient, including one’s physical behaviour, speech, and mind.
Moreover, one will become more mentally strong, for example one’s
mindfulness and concentration will be improved. {1126} One can thus
learn how to benefit from suffering. For this reason the Buddha stated
that a wise person can be happy even while encountering difficulty. One
is able to be happy even amidst suffering. Suffering can thus be a boon
if one is able to benefit from it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<h3 id="happiness-is-reached-by-happiness-1"><a class="header" href="#happiness-is-reached-by-happiness-1">Happiness Is Reached by Happiness</a></h3>
<p>In order to clarify the Buddhist viewpoint on happiness let us return to
the passage cited at the beginning of this chapter, stating that the
highest goal of Buddhism is to be reached by way of happiness, or by way
of a practice endowed with happiness. It is not to be reached through
suffering, or by way of a practice of pain.</p>
<p>On one occasion Prince Bodhi had the following conversation with the
Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Prince Bodhi:</em> Venerable sir, I believe thus: ’Happiness is not to be
gained through happiness; happiness is to be gained through pain.’</p>
<p><em>Buddha:</em> Prince, before my awakening, while I was still only an
unenlightened bodhisatta, I too thought thus: ’Happiness is not to be
gained through happiness; happiness is to be gained through pain.’</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha went on to say that due to this thinking he went forth as a
renunciant and studied with both Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta,
until he had gained the same knowledge as these two eminent teachers. He
then travelled further until he arrived at Senānigama near Uruvelā, and
undertook extreme ascetic practices, tormenting himself in various ways
and fasting, until his body was emaciated:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Because of eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments
of eighty-stem vines or black-stem vines … my haunches became like a
camel’s hoof … the projections on my spine stood forth like corded
beads<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn82">82</a></sup> … my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the rafters of an old
roofless barn … my eyes sank far down in their sockets, looking like
the reflection of stars in a deep well … my scalp shrivelled and
withered as a freshly cut bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the
wind and sun … my belly skin adhered to my backbone; thus if I
rubbed my belly skin I touched my backbone and if I rubbed my backbone
I touched my belly skin … if I urinated or defecated, I staggered
and fell over there. Because of eating so little, if I tried to ease
my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its
roots, fell from my body as I rubbed. {1060}</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In the end, the Bodhisatta reflected:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever recluses or brahmins in the past … in the future … in the
present have experienced painful, racking, piercing feelings due to
exertion, this is the utmost, there is none beyond this. But by this
racking practice of austerities I have not attained any superhuman
states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble
ones. Could there be another path to awakening?</p>
<p>I considered: ’I clearly recall that during the ploughing ceremony of
my father the Sakyan king, I was sitting in the cool shade of a
jambolan tree, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, and I entered upon and abided in the first jhāna,
which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture
and pleasure born of seclusion. Could that be the path to awakening?’
Then, following on that memory, came the realization: ’That is the
path to awakening.’ I asked myself: ’Am I afraid of that pleasure that
has nothing to do with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states?’ And
I thought: ’I am not afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do
with sensual pleasures and unwholesome states.’</p>
<p><em>M. II. 93.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Bodhisatta then ate solid food, restoring his strength. He practised
the jhānas up to the fourth jhāna and subsequently was fully
awakened.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn83">83</a></sup></p>
<p>The Buddhist practice for reaching the highest goal incorporates
happiness. The caveat here, however, is that a practitioner must not get
caught up in the happiness, nor allow it to overwhelm the mind. The mind
remains independent, allowing the person to progress to higher states
and to eventually realize complete deliverance. Having reached this
liberation, one is able to enjoy all levels of happiness without it
dominating the mind or leading to infatuation and difficulty.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn84">84</a></sup></p>
<p>On some occasions, when drawing a comparison or when playing on words,
the Buddha referred to the assiduous practice of the four jhānas as an
’indulgence’ in happiness (<em>sukhallikānuyoga</em>), but it is a beneficial
indulgence, conducive to awakening.</p>
<p>The reason the Buddha defended the practice of the jhānas is that
renunciants at that time tended to undertake severe practices of
self-mortification. In comparison, the Buddhist monastic practices
appeared easy and comfortable. Members of other religious traditions
frequently criticized the Buddhist monks for being lax, as is seen in
this passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>It may be, Cunda, that wanderers of other sects might say: ’The
ascetics, the sons of the Sakyan, are preoccupied by and devoted to
pleasure, indulge in pleasure. If so, they should be asked: ’What kind
of devotion to pleasure (sukhallikānuyoga; ’indulgence in pleasure’)?
For this devotion in pleasure can take many different forms.’ {1061}</p>
<p>There are, Cunda, four kinds of devotion to pleasure which are low,
vulgar, worldly, ignoble, and not conducive to welfare, not leading to
disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to tranquillity, to
realization, to awakening, to Nibbāna. What are they? Firstly, a
foolish person takes pleasure and delight in killing living beings …
takes pleasure and delight in taking that which is not given … takes
pleasure and delight in telling lies … gives himself up to the
indulgence in and enjoyment of the pleasures of the five senses….</p>
<p>There are, Cunda, four kinds of devotion to pleasure which are
entirely conducive to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to
tranquillity, to realization, to awakening, to Nibbāna. What are they?
Here, a monk, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from
unwholesome states, enters upon and abides in the first jhāna … the
second jhāna … the third jhāna … the fourth jhāna.</p>
<p><em>D. III. 130-32.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<h3 id="proper-attitude-towards-happiness"><a class="header" href="#proper-attitude-towards-happiness">Proper Attitude Towards Happiness</a></h3>
<p>There are three chief principles in Buddhism pertaining to a proper
attitude towards happiness, as confirmed by this teaching of the Buddha:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, how is exertion fruitful, how is striving fruitful? Here, a
monk in this Dhamma and Discipline:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Does not create suffering for himself when he is not beset by
suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not forsake genuine happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does not become infatuated with that happiness (i.e. even with
genuine happiness).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn85">85</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>M. II. 222-3.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Buddha did not end the teaching here. He went on to describe another
vital stage of practice, which can be classified as a fourth principle,
that is, to strive in order to completely eradicate the cause of
suffering. This fourth factor is the decisive criterion for reaching the
final goal of Buddhism, because in order to realize the highest truth
one must first completely remove the causes for suffering.</p>
<p>From the perspective of gradual Dhamma practice, this fourth principle
can be expressed in another way: to strive in order to realize higher
forms of happiness, until one reaches the supreme happiness, which is
utterly free from suffering. One can thus outline the practice in regard
to happiness – the set of criteria for Buddhists in their relationship
to happiness – as fourfold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To not create suffering for oneself in times without suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To not abandon genuine happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To not indulge even in this genuine happiness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To strive to put an end to the causes of suffering (to strive to
realize supreme happiness). {1062}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although these principles of practice in relation to happiness exist,
the subtlety and depth of understanding vis-à-vis happiness differs
between people, which is a factor that needs to be taken into
consideration. For example, the practice of someone who sees the danger
in sense pleasure, who is disillusioned by it and seeks more refined
forms of happiness, may involve stages that are arduous, and this
practice is viewed by those people who are still attached to sense
pleasure as a form of self-inflicted suffering.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, for those practitioners who are prepared, who are
disenchanted with sense pleasure and for whom sense pleasure has become
a form of hardship, or even for those people who are not yet fully
prepared, but who see the danger in sense pleasure and who see the value
of and aspire to more refined, independent forms of happiness, these
arduous forms of practice become a means for training themselves. If
these people had acted voluntarily and they did not fall into the
extreme of self-mortification, the Buddha consented to this practice as
a form of spiritual training.</p>
<p>Moreover, some aspects of the lives of those who have experienced more
refined forms of happiness are viewed by those people attached to sense
pleasure as miserable or painful. The reverse is also true: those people
who have experienced more refined forms of happiness see aspects of the
lives of those caught up in sense pleasure as suffering. In any case,
those people who have experienced higher forms of happiness know this
happiness for themselves. Therefore, the question of whether Buddhism
ultimately prizes pleasure or prizes pain – whether it is a hedonistic
or an extreme asceticist or masochistic teaching – can be cast aside,
for it is neither of these.</p>
<p>The question that remains here pertains to the evaluation or
significance of different kinds of happiness, that is, one faces a
choice between sense pleasure (which depends on external things) and
more refined kinds of happiness (which are internal, self-generated, and
independent). In the scriptures, refined happiness is determined as more
important.</p>
<p>In sum, one should access refined forms of happiness, or at the very
least one should experience both sense pleasure and refined happiness.
That is, one should at least match the realization of stream-enterers
and once-returners, who still enjoy sense pleasure, yet have reached an
unfettered, internal happiness as well.</p>
<p>A general principle for advancing from sense pleasure to more refined
happiness – from the pleasure of consuming to an independent happiness
– is spiritual preparedness and discipline. A corresponding principle
is that all people should experience righteous forms of happiness that
are appropriate to their standing in life or that result from their
individual perseverance and self-discipline.</p>
<p>Those people who are in want of both kinds of advantageous happiness,
that is, they are deprived of sense pleasure and they have not made the
effort to reach higher forms of happiness, are considered misdirected
and incompetent. In this sense, those bhikkhus who have renounced sense
pleasure yet do not make the effort to reach more refined forms of
happiness, or whose practice is fruitless, are dissolute. They miss a
valuable opportunity and are considered more unfortunate and pitiable
than laypeople who indulge in sense pleasure. The Buddha said:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>It is in such a way, monks, that a clansman has gone forth. Yet he is
covetous, inflamed by lust for sensual pleasures, with a mind full of
ill-will, with evil intentions, muddle-minded, lacking clear
comprehension, unconcentrated, scatterbrained, unrestrained in his
sense faculties. Just as a stick of wood from a funeral pyre, burning
at both ends and smeared with excrement in the middle, cannot be used
as timber either in the village or in the forest, in just such a way
do I speak about this person: he has missed out on the enjoyments of a
householder, yet he does not fulfil the goal of a life of
renunciation. {1063}</p>

<h3 id="spiritual-practice-in-relation-to-happiness"><a class="header" href="#spiritual-practice-in-relation-to-happiness">Spiritual Practice in Relation to Happiness</a></h3>
<p>Using sense pleasure as a guideline, one can summarize the Buddhist
attitude towards happiness in the following way:</p>
<h3 id="enjoyment-of-sense-pleasure"><a class="header" href="#enjoyment-of-sense-pleasure">Enjoyment of Sense Pleasure</a></h3>
<p><strong>A. Stage of excellence:</strong> to enjoy sense pleasures while at the same
time being familiar with more refined kinds of happiness. This refined
happiness acts as a safeguard and guarantee, keeping the enjoyment of
sense pleasures within wholesome and virtuous limits, preventing the
creation of problems for oneself and others, and generating benefits to
all. Here, one discerns the dangers and drawbacks of sense pleasure, one
knows moderation, and one avoids heedlessness. For example, in terms of
sexual relations, married people are content with their spouse
(<em>sadāra-santosa</em>) and live together righteously, by being faithful to
one another and encouraging each other to grow in virtue and reach
higher forms of happiness, as is seen in the case of the awakened
disciples Nakulapitā and Nakulamātā.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn86">86</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>B. Wholesome stage:</strong> although one enjoys sense pleasure in a morally
upright way, one is still cut off from more refined forms of happiness.
This enjoyment resembles the stage of excellence above: one sees the
dangers in sense pleasure and acknowledges that sense pleasure is
inevitably accompanied by a certain degree of suffering. One tries to
minimize the harm created by sense pleasure, one is moderate and
abstains from indulgence, and one tries to be of benefit to both oneself
and others. But because one lacks the way out and the surety of more
refined happiness, one is still at risk of being enticed by things and
falling knee-deep into sense indulgence. One is not yet safe.</p>
<p><strong>C. Inferior stage:</strong> to be caught up in sense pleasure; to be obsessed
with the pursuit of sense pleasure and personal gratification. For
example, in regard to eating or sexual relations, one is impelled to
feel arousal, excitement, and agitation that exceeds what can be called
the requirements of nature vis-à-vis eating and reproduction. One may
devise methods and means for stimulating this excitement and agitation,
by using one’s natural urges simply as a fuel to light the fire. One
then increases the passion, making it frequent or continual, even to the
extent of perversion.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, eating food which does not necessarily nourish
the body, or having sex removed from the act of reproduction, will be
accentuated until the person entirely forgets the original purpose of
these actions. These activities will be pursued solely to satisfy
craving; it will be an indulgence in sense pleasure for its own sake.
One’s life will be entirely dedicated to consuming things.</p>
<p>On a social level, when people go beyond the simple relief of natural
urges and inclinations to the deliberate creation of excitement and
agitation, to the extent that this becomes rampant, that society exists
as if in a constant state of warfare, which one can call the battlefield
of sense desire.</p>
<p>In times of literal war, people are incited to feel hatred and
resentment over and above the natural feelings people have of anger and
indignation. Eventually, people are prepared to slaughter and destroy
each other, and there is even an expressed admiration and satisfaction
in such destruction. {1064}</p>
<p>This escalation of people’s feelings by sense desire is similar.
Incitement and stimulation generates lust and a fixation on consuming
things, exceeding the natural desire inherent in people.</p>
<p>This intensified desire is a partner to and the origin of the battle of
hatred. People who normally live at ease and act in positive ways become
provoked by sense desire, giving rise to stress and agitation; they can
no longer bear to live at ease. They are then incited to feel anger and
discontentment, until the only satisfaction they can find is through
destruction.</p>
<p>When this battle of sense desire is protracted, and there are added
factors like stimulating and provocative advertisements, people will
have a proclivity to not see others as human companions, or even as
human. Instead they will see others as prey, as objects to consume or as
objects of enjoyment. They will expect to derive pleasure from other
people, and if others do not provide this expected pleasure they will
view them as rivals or impediments, or as offensive, useless, loathsome,
and irritating.</p>
<p>When people are engrossed in the pursuit of sense pleasure, it will be
difficult for them to generate a wholesome enthusiasm for their work.
They will lack a love for their work, and lack determination and
one-pointedness of mind. Wholesome enthusiasm will be replaced by
craving. People will simply wait for an opportunity to indulge in sense
pleasure, and perform activities in order to gain some personal
advantage. The performing of work in order to achieve true success and
excellence will vanish. People will work simply to complete the task, or
to create a semblance of completion. Moreover, they will seek sense
pleasure by taking shortcuts, which do not require any effort and lead
to immoral behaviour and crime.</p>
<p>When people begin to see each other as prey and as competitors, and are
preoccupied with the pursuit of sense pleasure and zealously guard the
objects they have seized, mutual mistrust, envy, and abuse will spread.
In this state of affairs, it will be difficult for people to experience
refined forms of happiness, even the simple pleasures of appreciating
friendship and mutual kindness or the delight and peace stemming from
opening oneself up to the beauty of nature. People will be unfamiliar
with the refreshing sense of ease that accompanies inner dignity and
virtue.</p>
<p>When people lack this refreshing sense of ease, their mental health will
drop to a critical level. This is because sense pleasure on its own,
devoid of such refined and wholesome mental qualities like love,
compassion, and generosity, inflames the mind and is not conducive to
mental health. If people associate with one another spurred on by lust,
each party will be seeking to get something from the other. Although
they may experience pleasure, it is likely to be detrimental to their
mental health.</p>
<p>Furthermore, relating to other people in order to obtain a personal
advantage, working not for the sake of the work but in order to get a
reward,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn87">87</a></sup> and struggling to compete with others leads to
disappointment, mistrust, vexation, and enmity, all of which blight the
heart and damage mental health. Although a society may be materially
prosperous, if it has fallen into such a state of indulgence its
citizens will not experience true happiness. Rather, they will be
subject to severe forms of suffering, including feelings of desolation,
fragility, and meaninglessness. {1065}</p>
<p>In a society deprived of individuals who are familiar with deeper forms
of peace and happiness, there is no source of such happiness even for
those people who are in extreme need of it. In a society inclined
towards sensual indulgence there will be many people who have either
been disappointed by their experiences connected to sense pleasure or
they have been impacted negatively in some other way. These people will
respond by feeling disillusioned by sense pleasure, or they will go to
an opposite extreme and feel hatred towards sense pleasure. They will
add to the ranks of those people, for example the old and invalid, who
no longer have the capacity to enjoy sense pleasures to the full.</p>
<p>These individuals are either unable to fully enjoy sense pleasure or
else they have an aversion to sense pleasure. If they have no access to
an internal happiness, they will experience serious mental difficulties.
If they still have adequate physical strength they may seek an escape by
using intoxicants or addictive substances, creating additional problems
for society. When the flood of sense craving overflows the banks and
people do not reform themselves in time, the corrupted society will
waste away and devour itself, and the civilization will collapse.</p>
<h3 id="abandonment-of-sense-pleasure"><a class="header" href="#abandonment-of-sense-pleasure">Abandonment of Sense Pleasure</a></h3>
<p><strong>A. Stage of excellence:</strong> to experience a genuine internal,
independent, and refined kind of happiness, which is complete in itself.
Here, a person has gone beyond a desire for sense pleasure. He or she
will automatically and naturally refrain from inclining or circling back
towards a pursuit of sense pleasure. Such a person is utterly free from
the problems arising from sense desire.</p>
<p><strong>B. Wholesome stage:</strong> the abandonment of sense pleasure of those who
aspire to and practise in order to reach more refined forms of
happiness. This abandonment is suitable for those who are disenchanted
with sense pleasure and are prepared to train in order to reach higher
forms of happiness, or even for those who may not have reached the stage
of disenchantment but who see the danger in sensuality, recognize the
value of and wish to experience more independent kinds of happiness, and
voluntarily take up a spiritual practice for this sake. This willingness
for and self-awareness in practice helps to prevent the ill effects
resulting from repression or overly forceful effort.</p>
<p>Whenever one no longer wishes to train, or when the faith for training
is truly depleted, one should acknowledge defeat and stop, for example
if one has been ordained as a bhikkhu one voluntarily gives up the
monastic training.</p>
<p>Although repeatedly being ordained and disrobing is not recommended, if
someone does this with sincerity it can still help to foster spiritual
preparedness, and can be considered a valid part of training, as is seen
in the example of Ven. Cittahatthisāriputta, who was ordained and
disrobed seven times before he finally reached the fruit of
arahantship.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn88">88</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>C. Inferior stage:</strong> to abandon sense pleasure out of reactivity and
resistance, and to subsequently fall into an opposite extreme. Here one
undertakes severe and punishing ascetic practices, piling up suffering
for oneself, by targeting one’s body or life in one’s loathing for sense
pleasure. This self-torment or exaggerated reaction, which lacks the
understanding and self-awareness described in the previous stage (B),
creates additional forms of mental problems. {1066}</p>
<p>Bear in mind that Buddhism considers the non-harming of oneself to be a
vital principle, and equally a form of Dhamma practice as refraining
from harming others.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn89">89</a></sup> Those people who have been overly forceful in
practice or who have reacted to sense pleasure by extreme forms of
behaviour should switch to the training described in the previous stage
(B).</p>
<p>Buddhism teaches to discern and acknowledge things as they truly are,
and to train oneself in order to progressively develop in the Dhamma.
Although Dhamma practitioners have different degrees of maturity and are
at different stages of development, they live together harmoniously and
support one another, promoting genuine wellbeing and encouraging each
person’s spiritual growth. They do not bully or disparage each other.
Together they build an environment of peace, friendliness, dignity,
prosperity, and happiness. {1067}</p>
<h3 id="perfect-happiness-1"><a class="header" href="#perfect-happiness-1">Perfect Happiness</a></h3>
<p>Here we arrive at the highest happiness, which in Buddhism is succinctly
described as: <em>nibbānaṃ paramaṃ sukhaṃ</em>: Nibbāna is the supreme
happiness.</p>
<p>When one has made initial contact with supreme happiness, or even when
simply referring to it, one should be familiar with its main attributes,
so that one can check whether one’s own happiness is going in the right
direction and how it can be improved – how its advantages may be
increased and its disadvantages lessened.</p>
<p>There are three main attributes to this supreme or perfect happiness:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is constant: it need not be searched for; it is an inherent
quality of the heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is free: it is not dependent on anything else; for example, it is
not reliant on sense objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is pure: it is complete; there remains no latent or lingering
suffering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Supreme happiness is constant because it has become an inherent feature
of one’s life. For this reason one need not search for it. {1133} The
Buddha, for example, was always happy wherever he went – when he
journeyed into forests and mountains, when he was with other people, and
when he was alone – because happiness was an indwelling quality in his
heart.</p>
<p>Supreme happiness is independent and free. This differs altogether from
sense pleasure, which is completely dependent on external, material
things. Sense pleasure requires the pursuit and appropriation of things.
One must look after and guard these things zealously. One loses one’s
own independence, and one vies with others, leading to conflict and
oppression. By developing independent happiness, one is inwardly free
and one need not compete with anyone else.</p>
<p>Supreme happiness is pure and complete. No disturbances or irritations
remain in the mind. Many people claim that they are happy, but deep down
there still remains suffering or the causes for suffering. For example,
they may still have latent anxiety, fear, distrust, melancholy, boredom,
or loneliness. Their purported happiness is not spacious, clear, and
full.</p>
<p>When all the causes for suffering have been removed from the mind,
happiness is replete. There remains no latent suffering that could
disturb the mind. If one wishes to experience other forms of happiness,
one can do this fully. One is inherently happy and one is prepared to
experience all forms of happiness to the utmost satisfaction. Take
arahants for example, who are endowed with this inherent and complete
happiness at all times. Besides abiding in this complete happiness, they
are also able to experience other forms of happiness according to their
wishes, and they experience these forms of happiness to the fullest
measure.</p>
<p>When arahants have free time and are not engaged in other activities,
they may enter the four jhānas and enjoy the bliss of jhāna
(<em>jhāna-sukha</em>). They use the jhānas to ’abide at ease in the present’
(<em>diṭṭhadhamma-sukhavihāra</em>). And they derive the utmost joy from these
states of jhāna, because no latent irritations or annoyances remain in
the mind. This stands in contrast to those unawakened human beings who
may be able to access jhāna, but who still have the root or seeds of
suffering lingering in their minds. Their joy is not truly spacious and
free.</p>
<p>In the Māgaṇḍiya Sutta, mentioned earlier, the Buddha states that if one
has not yet realized this profound happiness, there is no guarantee that
one will not fall back and seek out sense pleasure once more. But if one
does have this realization, there is no way that one will consider
seeking gratification by way of sense pleasure.</p>
<p>This is similar to adults who observe children playing and pretending to
be shopkeepers. They won’t feel that behaving in this way themselves
will provide happiness. This is not because they cannot engage in this
activity, but because they have experienced higher forms of happiness.
Within the natural development of happiness, the mind will automatically
respond in this way. {1134}</p>
<p>To sum up, arahants are endowed with an inner happiness that is present
at all time, and they are able to enjoy other forms of happiness fully,
according to their desire. If it so happens that they do not take
pleasure in other forms of happiness, this is because they have passed
beyond the associated desire and have access to a higher happiness.</p>
<h3 id="acting-for-the-happiness-of-all"><a class="header" href="#acting-for-the-happiness-of-all">Acting for the Happiness of All</a></h3>
<p>Because their happiness is complete and spacious, arahants are able to
immediately derive delight from wholesome things. For example, when they
come into contact with nature, say by ascending a mountain or entering a
forest, their delight is spontaneous and instant, free from any inner
obstruction or impediment.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to people who still harbour the seeds of suffering.
When they arrive at a delightful place, myriad thoughts and emotions
disturb their minds, like worry, anxiety, unease, and thoughts of
rivalry, commerce, politics, etc. This prevents them from being happy,
and even if they are happy, their happiness is limited.</p>
<p>Arahants, on the other hand, find happiness wherever they go; even
unfavourable environments become a source of delight. This happiness
does not extend only to themselves; other people who live in their
company experience ease and comfort in places that previously caused
disquiet and turmoil. Note the verse in the Dhammapada:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Whether in village or in forest, on hill or in dale, wherever
arahants dwell – delightful, indeed, is that spot.</p>
<p><em>Gāme vā yadi vāraññe ninne vā yadi vā thale yattha arahanto viharanti
taṃ bhūmirāmaṇeyyakaṃ.</em></p>
<p><em>Dh. verse 98.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Wherever arahants dwell, they themselves are joyous and people
surrounding them are delighted. Arahants are able to view offensive and
disagreeable things as pleasant and agreeable, because they have mastery
over their perceptions (they have developed the sense faculties –
<em>bhāvitindriya</em>). This demonstrates the human potential for happiness
corresponding to spiritual development.</p>
<p>If one practises the Dhamma correctly, happiness gradually increases in
this way. And when happiness is complete, all other spiritual qualities
are complete. This follows a natural process, like a hen incubating an
egg. If the conditions are present, the chick will hatch with certainty;
there is no room for doubt.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, it is valid to describe Buddhism as a system of
developing happiness or as a process of eliminating suffering. Or one
may use any other description that is in line with Dhamma and accords
with nature. They all refer to the same thing.</p>
<p>Before we finish, there is one more subject to touch upon. Complete and
perfect happiness has attributes that are expressed outwardly. {1135}
Arahants have completed their spiritual training and brought happiness
to perfection. Indeed, all of their spiritual qualities are fulfilled,
converging at wisdom – the supreme knowledge of awakening – which
leads to deliverance. They relate to things in a correct and balanced
way. Arahants are given the epithet <em>kata karaṇīya</em>: those who have done
what had to be done. Nothing remains to be done in order to bring about
a state of completion, or in order to make themselves happy. Nothing is
left unfinished in their spiritual training and development. Their
spiritual development is complete. They are adepts (<em>asekha</em>); they are
fully developed (<em>bhāvita</em>).</p>
<p>What does one do when there remains no personal business to attend to –
nothing to be done in order to be happy or to develop oneself
spiritually? One is still alive, one is consummate in virtuous conduct,
mental proficiency, and wisdom, and one is brimful of extraordinary
experience. The answer is one uses all of one’s remaining energy to
foster the wellbeing of the manyfolk. It is a Buddhist principle that
someone who realizes Nibbāna acts for the welfare of the world.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, wisdom leads to the liberation of the mind.
Liberated individuals are fully prepared to respond to those people who
are still afflicted by suffering. They generate genuine compassion and
devote themselves to alleviating the suffering of others. This is the
essential task of arahants.</p>
<p>It is normal for people to vent their suffering outwards. If they use
their speech carefully to express their suffering, it can ease the
tension and there is a good possibility that this will help to solve
their difficulties. But if they are heedless with speech, the expression
of suffering may escalate into physical gestures of violence, causing
much trouble and turmoil for others.</p>
<p>Happiness, too, can be radiated outwards. And those individuals who are
replete in happiness and whose minds are liberated wish to facilitate
the mental emancipation of others. Arahants are similar to people who
have freed themselves from shackles and chains. When all personal
distress and affliction has been quelled, they feel compassion for
others who are still bound and they want to offer assistance. They then
spend the majority of their time trying to help others be free. {1136}</p>
<p>When the Buddha was sending the first group of sixty arahants out to
proclaim the Buddhist teachings, he said that both he and they were
similar in being liberated from all snares and bonds, both human and
divine. He went on to say: ’Bhikkhus, wander forth for the welfare and
happiness of the manyfolk, for the compassionate assistance of the
world’ (<em>caratha bhikkhave cārikaṃ bahujanahitāya bahujanasukhāya
lokānukampāya</em>). This the motto of all arahants. Having completed all
personal affairs and duties, they dedicate their lives for the good of
the world, just as the Buddha did.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, spiritual practice is twofold: it involves both
self-discipline and assisting others. Occasionally, as in the case of
bodhisattas, an increased emphasis is given to the latter, of helping
others. These two aspects of practice are intimately connected, for
helping others is one way to promote self-development.</p>
<p>All aspects of spiritual practice, whether one focuses on personal
training or one focuses on helping others, are a part of one’s spiritual
development. As long as one has not finished what has to be done, both
aspects of practice are part of this personal development. When one has
brought spiritual development to completion and accomplished all of
one’s spiritual responsibilities, one’s entire life is devoted to
others. As mentioned above, those who realize Nibbāna act for the
welfare of the world. Here, the complete and perfect happiness inherent
in an individual radiates outward and becomes the happiness of all.</p>
<p>The core Buddhist teaching on happiness as the highest goal of spiritual
practice, and the other core teaching on happiness as the highest aim of
fulfilling one’s responsibility towards others as a Buddhist, are
united. The teaching, ’Nibbāna is the supreme happiness’, is integrated
with the teaching, ’For the welfare and happiness of the manyfolk, for
the compassionate assistance of the world.’ The highest reality of
’supreme happiness’ (<em>parama-sukha</em>) yields the ’happiness of the
manyfolk’ (<em>bahujana-sukha</em>). In sum, Buddhism is a system of developing
happiness; it is a religion of happiness.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-2-threefold-happiness-alternative-model"><a class="header" href="#appendix-2-threefold-happiness-alternative-model">Appendix 2: Threefold Happiness (alternative model)</a></h2>
<p>The Saṁyutta Nikāya contains another classification of happiness that is
very similar to the one discussed at the beginning of this chapter
(<em>kāma-sukha</em>, <em>jhāna-sukha</em>, and <em>nirodhasamāpatti-sukha</em>). This is
likewise a threefold division:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn92">92</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Happiness dependent on material things (<em>sāmisa-sukha</em>); this is
equivalent to sense pleasure (<em>kāma-sukha</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-material happiness (<em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>); this refers to the
happiness of the first three jhānas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness exceeding and transcending non-material happiness
(<em>nirāmisatara-sukha</em>); this refers to the happiness and joy
experienced by one whose mind is free from mental taints
(<em>khīṇāsava</em>), who reflects on the mind liberated from greed, hatred
and delusion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The commentaries claim that, although the third kind of happiness is
technically mundane (<em>lokiya</em>) – it can be described as the happiness
resulting from an arahant’s knowledge of reviewing
(<em>paccavekkhaṇa-ñāṇa</em>) – it is superior to the second kind of
happiness, which may be either mundane or transcendent (<em>lokuttara</em>; it
is transcendent when it refers to the jhāna of an awakened person).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn93">93</a></sup>
{1068}</p>
<p>These two classifications of happiness are almost the same because they
have a similarity in scope:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Sāmisa-sukha</em> is equivalent to <em>kāma-sukha</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nirāmisa-sukha</em> is part of the domain of <em>jhāna-sukha</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Nirāmisatara-sukha</em> goes beyond or transcends <em>jhāna-sukha</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The important difference between these two classifications is that the
first group (<em>kāma-sukha</em>, <em>jhāna-sukha</em>, and <em>nirodhasamāpatti-sukha</em>)
encompasses all forms of happiness, both that which is a sensation
(<em>vedanā</em>) and that which is not. The factors of the second group
(<em>sāmisa-sukha</em>, <em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>, and <em>nirāmisatara-sukha</em>), however,
are all included in happiness that is a sensation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the highest form of non-material happiness
(<em>nirāmisa-sukha</em>), which is part of the third jhāna, does not cover all
forms of <em>jhāna-sukha</em>. In reference to the fourth jhāna the distinctive
term <em>nirāmisa-upekkhā</em> is used; at S. IV. 237 this term is also used in
reference to the formless jhānas (<em>arūpa-jhāna</em>), because technically
they are part of the fourth jhāna.</p>
<p>A clear distinction can be made between <em>nirodhasamāpatti-sukha</em> and
<em>nirāmisatara-sukha</em>. Although <em>nirodhasamāpatti-sukha</em> goes beyond
jhāna, it still pertains to a meditative attainment (<em>samāpatti</em>), and
it is only accessible by those arahants and non-returners proficient in
the eight jhānas. <em>Nirāmisatara-sukha</em> here refers to the happiness
resulting from the knowledge of reviewing; it refers only to arahants,
who can either be those liberated both ways (<em>ubhatobhāga-vimutta</em>) or
those liberated by wisdom (<em>paññā-vimutta</em>; i.e. they have not reached
the eight concentrative attainments). In any case, by focusing on the
literal meaning of the term, <em>nirodhasamāpatti-sukha</em> should in some
respects also be classified as a happiness exceeding non-material
happiness.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-3-threefold-happiness-sense-pleasure-divine-happiness-and-the-happiness-of-the-destruction-of-craving"><a class="header" href="#appendix-3-threefold-happiness-sense-pleasure-divine-happiness-and-the-happiness-of-the-destruction-of-craving">Appendix 3: Threefold Happiness: Sense Pleasure, Divine Happiness, and the Happiness of the Destruction of Craving</a></h2>
<p>Sense pleasure has already been described at length. Divine happiness is
defined in the commentaries as the happiness of jhāna (specifically the
happiness of mundane concentrative absorption –
<em>lokiyajhāna-sukha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn94">94</a></sup> The commentaries equate divine happiness with
jhānic happiness, because they determine jhāna to be a ’divine abiding’
(<em>dibba-vihāra</em>), in accord with a teaching in the Dīgha Nikāya.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn95">95</a></sup>
The commentary to the Dīgha Nikāya states that divine happiness refers
to the eight concentrative attainments.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn96">96</a></sup> The ordinary celestial
pleasures of divine beings is already included in the factor of sense
pleasure. Happiness of the destruction of craving (<em>taṇhakkhaya-sukha</em>)
refers to the happiness of Nibbāna (<em>nibbāna-sukha</em>) – as the term
<em>taṇhakkhaya</em> is a synonym for Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The commentary of the Udāna, however, interprets <em>taṇhakkhaya-sukha</em> to
be the happiness of fruition attainment (<em>phalasamāpatti-sukha</em>), which
is accessible to all awakened beings from stream-enterers upwards,
through establishing Nibbāna as one’s object of attention. Here, I use
the term <em>taṇhakkhaya-sukha</em> in a broad sense, encompassing the
happiness of fruition attainment, the happiness of the attainment of
cessation (<em>nirodha-samāpatti</em>, a state resembling Nibbāna), and the
happiness of liberation (<em>vimutti-sukha</em>) which is frequently referred
to in the scriptures (<em>vimutti-sukha</em> refers to the highest fruition
attainment – <em>phala-samāpatti</em> – which is the domain of
arahants).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn97">97</a></sup></p>
<p>This classification is similar to the tenfold classification of
happiness above.</p>
<p>The most detailed classification of happiness in the commentaries is
found in the commentary to the Aṅguttara Nikāya, which divides happiness
into seven levels: human happiness (<em>manussa-sukha</em>), divine happiness
(<em>divya-sukha</em>), jhānic happiness, the happiness of insight
(<em>vipassanā-sukha</em>), the happiness of the Path (<em>magga-sukha</em>), fruition
happiness (<em>phala-sukha</em>), and the happiness of Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn98">98</a></sup> These
seven kinds of happiness can be condensed into four:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sense pleasure (<em>kāma-sukha</em>), including human happiness and divine
happiness (the latter referring specifically to the pleasure
experienced by celestial beings or the happiness of heaven).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of jhāna (<em>jhāna-sukha</em>): the happiness of mundane
concentrative attainments (<em>lokiyajhāna-sukha</em>;
<em>lokiyasamāpatti-sukha</em>). In some places this is referred to as
divine happiness (<em>divya-sukha</em>), in the sense of being a divine
abiding (<em>dibba-vihāra</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Happiness of insight meditation (<em>vipassanā-sukha</em>). This appears
clearly as one of the ten imperfections of insight
(<em>vipassanūpakilesa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn99">99</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transcendent happiness (<em>lokuttara-sukha</em>): Path happiness
(<em>magga-sukha</em>), fruition happiness (<em>phala-sukha</em>), and the
happiness of Nibbāna.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn100">100</a></sup> The term <em>phala-sukha</em> includes
<em>phalasamāpatti-sukha</em>, which itself incorporates <em>vimutti-sukha</em> as
well.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn101">101</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="appendix-4-temporary-ordination"><a class="header" href="#appendix-4-temporary-ordination">Appendix 4: Temporary Ordination</a></h2>
<p>In Thailand there is a custom referred to as ’ordination for study’
(<em>buat rian</em>; บวชเรียน). Besides providing an opportunity to those who
are prepared to train themselves in order to experience more refined
forms of happiness, this kind of ordination is a way of providing an
education to the wider population, by offering a training to young
people in the areas of academic knowledge, ethics, and cultural
traditions. It is a rite of passage – a means for preparing people to
enter society as adults.</p>
<p>Most of these individuals are ordained while still young (in the case of
novice monks, they are still children) and do so because of the wishes
of their guardians. After they have been ordained and received an
adequate level of training, they can voluntary decide by themselves
whether to continue as monks or to return to the householder’s life with
the full acceptance by the wider society.</p>
<p>During the time of being ordained these individuals are aware that they
have entered a system of training. If they are not really dedicated to
this way of life they can train for a short period of time and then
stop. This way they can accept the conditions for what they are. Some of
these individuals who are not prepared for a longterm commitment to the
renunciant life may devote themselves earnestly to the training for a
fixed period of time.</p>
<p>Training with this kind of acceptance can lead to good results. It
prevents the harm of feeling that one is subject to compulsion or
confinement, which would lead to a struggle against the form. If there
are disadvantages to this kind of training, they are minimized.</p>
<p>If one wishes to preserve this kind of ’ordination for study’ then one
must give people the freedom and liberty to disrobe when they wish. This
is fair treatment to those individuals and it will benefit the wider
society.</p>

<p>See: M. I. 246-7; M. II. 93. These are references by the Buddha
pertaining to his own practice. The word <em>dukkha</em> in this context
refers to suffering as a result of self-mortification
(<em>dukkara-kiriyā</em>). This should not be confused with the terms
<em>dukkha-paṭipadā</em> and <em>sukha-paṭipadā</em>, of which the former simply
refers to difficult, arduous practice (A. II. 149-52). The Nigaṇṭhā
(Jains) had the belief that: ’Happiness cannot be reached by
happiness; it can only be reached by pain.’ For this reason they
practised severe austerities and self-mortification
(<em>atta-kilamathānuyoga</em>) – M. I. 93-4. Before the Buddha’s
awakening he had the same understanding and thus practised extreme
austerities in vain for a long time (M. II. 93).</p>

love of fellow living beings. Love of Dhamma, love of truth, love of
justice, and love of righteousness then invokes wisdom, and one

sounds, fragrant odours, delicious tastes, and delightful tangible
objects (e.g. a soft, silky bed), without exception. They include
all things providing material pleasure (<em>āmisa-sukha</em>). Therefore,

<p>Note the Buddha’s words: ’The pretty things in the world are not
sense desire (<em>kāma</em>); rather, a person’s lustful intent is sense
desire. The pretty things in the world exist just as they are
[according to their nature]; therefore the wise remove [only]
the craving (<em>taṇhā-chanda</em>) for them.’ (I.e. the wise do not
eliminate the pretty things in the world); A. III. 411.</p>

<p>Another way of interpreting this analogy is as follows: sense
objects are like the fruit of a tree, the trunk of which is being
cut by impermanence and instability. Decay and death, for instance,
are constantly eating away at the trunk, wearing it away and leading
to its eventual collapse. A person indulging in sense desire is
constantly threatened by fear and apprehension resulting from this
instability and uncertainty. The more a person is obsessed with
sensuality and is unable to renounce it, the greater the risk there
is of being severely injured by the falling tree.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Basic definitions for the term paṭiccasamuppāda include ‘dependent
origination’, ‘dependent co-origination’, and the ‘origin of suffering
dependent on co-conditionality’.</p>
<p>The Buddha presented the teaching of Dependent Origination
(<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>) in two ways: general presentations, which do not
specify each factor of the process, and detailed presentations listing
each factor in a connected sequence. The general presentation usually
occurs preceding the detailed presentation. The detailed presentation is
found frequently in the scriptures, usually alone, without the general
presentation; it expands on the general presentation, describing and
analyzing each factor of Dependent Origination.</p>

</div>
<p>Both of these formats can be divided into two parts – the process of
origination and the process of cessation. The first sequence, the
process of origination, is called the cycle of origination
(<em>samudaya-vāra</em>). It is also known as the forward sequence
(*anuloma-*paṭiccasamuppāda) and is equivalent to the second Noble
Truth: the origin of suffering (dukkha-samudaya). The latter sequence is
called the cycle of cessation (nirodha-vāra) or the reverse sequence
(paṭiloma-paṭiccasamuppāda); it corresponds to the third Noble Truth:
the cessation of suffering (dukkha-nirodha).</p>
<p>The closing statements of the detailed presentation indicate that
Dependent Origination deals with the origin and cessation of suffering.
Most of the scriptural references to Dependent Origination end with
these statements. There are, however, passages that end with the origin
and cessation of the ‘world’:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>This, bhikkhus, is the origin of the world;<br />
this, bhikkhus, is the cessation of the world;</p>
<p><em>Ayaṃ kho bhikkhave lokassa samudayo;<br />
ayaṃ kho bhikkhave lokassa atthaṅgamo.</em> <em>S. II. 73.</em></p>
<p>In such a way the world originates,<br />
in such a way the world ceases. {156}</p>
<p><em>Evamayaṃ loko samudayati;<br />
evamayaṃ loko nirujjhati.</em> <em>S. II. 78.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Here the words ‘suffering’ and the ‘world’ are interchangeable, which
will be explained below.</p>
<p>The detailed presentation of Dependent Origination contains twelve
factors, which are part of an interconnected cycle, without a beginning
or an end. There is no ‘first cause’ (<em>mūla-kāraṇa</em>). For convenience of
exposition, the Buddha chose ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>) as the most suitable
candidate to place at the start of the list of factors, but this is not
intended to imply that ignorance is the first cause. Occasionally, to
prevent the misunderstanding that ignorance is the ‘first cause’, he
inserted the following statement:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>With the arising of the taints, ignorance arises; with the cessation
of the taints, ignorance ceases.</p>
<p><em>Āsava samudayā avijjā samudayo, āsava nirodhā avijjā nirodho.</em></p>
<p><em>M. I. 55.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The twelve factors of Dependent Origination, beginning with ignorance
and ending with aging-and-death, are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><em>Avijjā</em> (ignorance) →<br />
<em>saṅkhāra</em> (volitional formations) →<br />
<em>viññāṇa</em> (consciousness) →<br />
<em>nāma-rūpa</em> (mind &amp; body) →<br />
<em>saḷāyatana</em> (six sense bases) →<br />
<em>phassa</em> (contact) →<br />
<em>vedanā</em> (feeling) →<br />
<em>taṇhā</em> (craving) →<br />
<em>upādāna</em> (clinging) →<br />
<em>bhava</em> (becoming) →<br />
<em>jāti</em> (birth) →<br />
<em>jarāmaraṇa</em> (aging-and-death).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair are results of the cycle of
Dependent Origination, arising in the minds of those who have mental
impurities (<em>āsava</em> &amp; <em>kilesa</em>) when they are faced with aging and
death. These results, however, take an active role by leading to a
further increase of mental taints (<em>āsava</em>), which are in turn the
conditions for ignorance and a continued rotation of the cycle.</p>
<p>In general, when presenting this detailed or ‘applied’ format of
Dependent Origination (comprising the entire twelve factors), the Buddha
mentioned the forward sequence only as an introduction. When he wished
to emphasize the direct human experience of suffering, he most often
presented Dependent Origination in the reverse sequence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><em>Jarāmaraṇa</em> ← <em>jāti</em> ← <em>bhava</em> ← <em>upādāna</em> ← <em>taṇhā</em> ← <em>vedanā</em> ←
<em>phassa</em> ← <em>saḷāyatana</em> ← <em>nāma-rūpa</em> ← <em>viññāṇa</em> ← <em>saṅkhāra</em> ←
<em>avijjā</em>.</em></p>
<p><em>S. II. 5-11, 81.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On some occasions, when he wished to highlight a particular factor, the
Buddha began the detailed presentation with one of the intermediate
factors. The presentation may begin with birth (<em>jāti</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> feeling
(<em>vedanā</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> or consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> and then be linked
with the subsequent factors until the process reaches aging-and-death
(for the forward sequence), or traced back to ignorance (for the reverse
sequence). Occasionally, the process begins with a factor or problem not
included in the group of twelve, and is then connected to the process of
Dependent Origination.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> In summary, the presentation of Dependent
Origination is not fixed and does not have to mention all twelve
factors. {157}</p>
<p>Although the twelve factors are said to be interdependent and act as
conditions for one another, this is not the same as saying they are
‘causes’ for one another. As a comparison, there are more conditions
other than the seed itself that permit a plant to grow: soil, water,
fertilizer, weather, and temperature all play a part. And these
interrelated conditions do not need to follow a set temporal sequence.
Similarly, a floor acts as a condition for the stability or positioning
of a table.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#significance-of-dependent-origination" id="significance-of-dependent-origination">Significance of Dependent Origination</a></h2>
<p>The Buddha presented the principle of Dependent Origination as a law of
nature, which does not rely on the emergence of a Buddha for its
existence. The Buddha presented Dependent Origination as a natural truth
in the following way:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Whether Tathāgatas arise or not, that principle of specific
conditionality<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup> is constant, certain, and a law of nature. Having
fully awakened to and penetrated to this truth, a Tathāgata announces
it, teaches it, clarifies it, formulates it, reveals it, and analyzes
it. And he says: ‘See! With ignorance as condition, there are
volitional formations....</p>
<p>Thus, bhikkhus, this actuality (tathatā), this inerrancy (avitathatā),
this invariability (anaññathatā) – this specific conditionality
(idappaccayatā) – this is called Dependent Origination.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. II. 25-6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The central importance of Dependent Origination is evident from the
Buddha’s words:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>One who sees Dependent Origination sees the Dhamma; one who sees the
Dhamma sees Dependent Origination.</p>
<p><em>M. I. 190-91.</em></p>
<p>Bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple has a knowledge about this
that is independent of others: ‘When this exists, that comes to be;
with the arising of this, that arises’.... When a noble disciple thus
understands as they really are the origin and the passing away of the
world, he is then called a noble disciple perfected in view, perfected
in vision, who has arrived at this true Dhamma, who possesses a
trainee’s knowledge, a trainee’s true knowledge, who has entered the
stream of the Dhamma, a noble one with penetrative wisdom, one who
stands squarely before the door to the Deathless. {153}</p>
<p><em>S. II. 78-9.</em></p>
<p>Those ascetics and brahmans who understand these things (i.e. the
factors of Dependent Origination), the origin of these things, the
cessation of these things, and the way leading to cessation of these
things ... those ascetics and brahmans are deserving of the
acknowledgement as ascetics among ascetics and brahmans among
brahmans. By realizing it for themselves with direct knowledge, they
are recognized as in this very life reaching and abiding in the goal
of asceticism and the goal of brahmanhood.</p>
<p><em>S. II. 16, 45-6, 129.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>On one occasion, the Buddha warned Ven. Ānanda not to misjudge the
complexity of Dependent Origination:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>[Ānanda:] ‘It is wonderful, venerable sir! It is marvellous,
venerable sir! This Dependent Origination is so deep and appears so
deep, yet to me it seems clear and easy to understand.’</p>
<p>[Buddha:] ‘Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! This Dependent
Origination is deep and appears deep. It is because of not
understanding and not penetrating this truth that this generation is
afflicted and become like a tangled skein, like a knotted ball of
thread, like matted reeds and rushes, and is unable to transcend the
plane of misery, the bad destinations, the lower worlds, and the round
of rebirth (saṁsāra).</p>
<p><em>S. II. 92.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Readers who are familiar with the Buddha’s life story will remember his
reluctance soon after his awakening to proclaim the Dhamma:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, this thought arose in me: ‘This Dhamma that I have attained
is profound, difficult to see, difficult to realize, peaceful,
excellent, not accessible by reasoning, to be known by the wise. But
this generation delights in attachment, takes pleasure in attachment,
rejoices in attachment.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup> It is hard for such a generation
delighting in attachment to see this truth, namely, specific
conditionality, Dependent Origination. And it is hard to see this
truth, namely, the stilling of all formations, the abandonment of all
foundations for suffering (upadhi), the end of craving, dispassion,
cessation, Nibbāna. If I were to teach the Dhamma and others would not
truly understand me, that would be wearying and troublesome for me.</p>
<p><em>Vin. I. 4-5; M. I. 167-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This passage mentions both Dependent Origination and Nibbāna,
emphasizing both the importance of these two truths and also the
difficulty in realizing them. The Buddha awakened to these truths and
explained them to others. {154}</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#interpretations-of-dependent-origination" id="interpretations-of-dependent-origination">Interpretations of Dependent Origination</a></h2>
<p>The teaching of Dependent Origination may be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>An explanation describing the evolution of the world and the cycle
of all life, by interpreting some of the Buddha’s words in a more
literal way, for example the Buddha’s teaching on the ‘origin of the
world’ (<em>loka-samudaya</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An explanation describing the birth and death of human beings and
the origin and cessation of human suffering. This explanation can be
sub-divided into two further categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A broad description of one life to another: the passing from one
realm of existence to another. This is also a literal
explanation and it is commonly found in the commentaries, where
it is systematized and described in great, and sometimes
intimidating, detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A description of a cycle present at each moment of life. This
description offers an interpretation of this teaching implicit
in the previous description (2A), but it focuses on a deeper
meaning of specific Pali terms, or on their practical
significance. This interpretation explains the whole cycle of
Dependent Origination in terms of present experience, which is
considered to be in line with the Buddha’s intention and the
real objective of this teaching, as evidenced by many discourses
of the Buddha, including the Cetanā Sutta,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> the
Dukkha-nirodha Sutta,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup> and the Lokanirodha Sutta.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup> In
the Abhidhamma an entire section is dedicated to the complete
sequence of Dependent Origination arising in a single mind
moment.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In reference to explanation #1, some people interpret Dependent
Origination as a theory of the origin (’genesis’) of the universe,
declaring ignorance as a ‘first cause’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup> in a process followed and
completed by the remaining eleven factors. {158} This interpretation
leads to the view that Buddhism resembles other religions and
philosophies that posit a prime agent, for example a creator God, who is
the source of all beings and all things. According to this
interpretation, the only difference is that these theistic doctrines
portray the creation and governing of the world by a force outside and
above nature, while Buddhism describes a causal, natural process.</p>
<p>This interpretation, however, is inaccurate, because any teaching that
professes a first cause or prime agent contradicts the teaching of
Dependent Origination or of specific conditionality. The teaching of
Dependent Origination offers an objective account of causality, that all
conditioned things are interrelated and interdependent. They arise in a
successive, causal process without beginning or end. A first cause,
either a creator God or other agent, is impossible. Therefore, the
explanation of Dependent Origination as describing the evolution of the
world is only suitable in the context of explaining a natural, causal
process of continual growth and disintegration, without beginning and
without end.</p>
<p>One way of determining whether an interpretation of Dependent
Origination is correct or not is to consider the Buddha’s intention in
teaching the Dhamma. The Buddha focused on things that can be applied to
bring about wellbeing, that are relevant to everyday life, and that
solve real life problems. He considered attempts to reach the truth
through metaphysical speculation and debate to be fruitless. Determining
what is truly Buddha-Dhamma thus requires a consideration of a
teaching’s ethical and practical value.</p>
<p>The worldview that stems from explanation #1 of Dependent Origination,
above, is suitable and accords with the aims of Buddha-Dhamma. It
provides a broad perspective that things proceed according to cause and
effect, that they depend on natural conditions, and that they neither
originate from a creator God nor do they arise randomly or by accident.
Moreover, it is conducive to bringing about the following three
practical benefits:</p>
<p>First, one realizes that to find success and fulfilment, one cannot rely
on hope, desire, fate, divine intervention, or supernatural powers. One
only reaches success through concerted action; one must be self-reliant
and generate the conditions that lead to success.</p>
<p>Second, to generate these conditions, one must properly understand each
factor within the dynamic of nature in which one is engaged, as well as
understanding the mutual relationship between factors; wisdom is
therefore an essential element in the process. {159}</p>
<p>Third, the knowledge of causal connections reduces or eliminates the
mistaken identification with things as a fixed ‘self’. This knowledge
promotes an appropriate relationship to things and leads to inner
freedom.</p>
<p>Although the explanation of Dependent Origination as describing a
beginningless and endless evolution of the world is acceptable, its
practical value is limited. It is not yet sufficiently cogent or
integrated to guarantee the three benefits mentioned above (especially
the third benefit of promoting freedom).</p>
<p>To truly profit from this broad interpretation of Dependent Origination,
one must refine one’s investigation by discerning the causal,
interdependent nature of all conditioned phenomena. When one develops
this clarity in every moment of one’s life, the three benefits mentioned
earlier are complete, and at the same time one reaches the true
objective of the interpretation related to the evolution of the world.</p>
<p>The explanation of Dependent Origination as the evolution of the world,
either in its broadest sense or in a more refined way, is a
contemplation of external phenomena. The second explanation, on the
other hand, emphasizes the internal life of human beings, including the
dynamic of human suffering.</p>
<p>The first sub-division (2A) is favoured by the commentaries, where it is
explained in great detail.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup> The commentaries coin many new
descriptive terms for this process in order to construct a clear,
organized system. The disadvantage, however, is that this system can
appear inflexible, and to students new to Buddhism, rather arcane. The
second sub-division (2B) is directly linked to the first (2A), as will
be described below. {160}</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#relational-context-of-dependent-origination" id="relational-context-of-dependent-origination">Relational Context of Dependent Origination</a></h2>
<p>The essential aim of Dependent Origination is to illustrate the origin
and cessation of suffering (dukkha). The term dukkha plays a pivotal
role in Buddha-Dhamma and appears in several key teachings, for example
the Three Characteristics and the Four Noble Truths. To understand the
complete meaning of the term dukkha, one must set aside the common
translation of ‘suffering’ and examine the threefold classification of
dukkha,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup> along with its commentarial explanations:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkha-dukkhatā</em>: a feeling of pain (<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>), as commonly
understood; physical suffering (e.g. aches and pains) and mental
suffering (e.g. grief); dis-ease; the suffering arising from
encounters with undesirable and disturbing sense objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vipariṇāma-dukkhatā</em>: suffering associated with change; suffering
inherent in pleasure. Pleasure becomes suffering or produces
suffering, due to the transitoriness of pleasure. A person may feel
at ease, without any disturbance, but after experiencing a more
pleasant form of ease, the original state of ease may feel
unpleasant. It is as if suffering lies latent and manifests when
pleasure fades away. The degree of suffering is proportional to the
degree of pleasure that precedes it. Suffering can even arise while
experiencing pleasure, if a person becomes aware of the fleeting
nature of that pleasure. And when pleasure ends, the sadness of
separation follows in its wake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Saṅkhāra-dukkhatā</em>: the <em>dukkha</em> of conditioned phenomena; the
<em>dukkha</em> of all things that arise from causes and conditions, that
is, the five aggregates (<em>khandha</em>), including ‘path’ (<em>magga</em>) and
‘fruit’ (<em>phala</em>), which are technically classified as
‘transcendent’. All conditioned things are oppressed by conflicting
component factors; all things arise and pass away; they are
imperfect. They exist in the ‘stream’ of causes and conditions,
which generate suffering for someone who does not understand the
nature of conditionality, who with craving, grasping and ignorance
foolishly resists this process, and who does not engage with it
wisely.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The third kind of <em>dukkha</em> reveals the inherent nature of conditioned
phenomena, but it also has a psychological dimension. This state of
imperfection and stress prevents thorough satisfaction with conditioned
phenomena and continually causes suffering for a person who relates to
things with craving, grasping and ignorance.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn20">20</a></sup> {161}</p>
<p>The meaning of this third kind of <em>dukkha</em> is thus all-inclusive. It
corresponds with the meaning of <em>dukkha</em> in the Three Characteristics
(’all conditioned things are <em>dukkha</em>’). The pressure and instability
inherent in things may lead to the <em>dukkha</em> of the Four Noble Truths,
whereby craving, grasping, and ignorance come to fruition as suffering,
and whereby the five aggregates of nature develop into the five
aggregates of clinging of human beings.</p>
<p>In this context, one can include the three kinds of feeling (<em>vedanā</em>):
pleasure (<em>sukha</em>), pain (<em>dukkha</em>), and neutral feeling (<em>upekkhā</em>).
Painful feeling (<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>) is part of the first kind of <em>dukkha</em>:
<em>dukkha-dukkhatā</em>. Pleasant feeling (<em>sukha-vedanā</em>) is introduced in
the second factor of <em>vipariṇāma-dukkhatā</em>. Although neutral feeling (or
‘equanimity’) escapes the first two factors, it is included in the final
factor of <em>saṅkhāra-dukkhatā</em>. Even equanimity is ephemeral, transient,
and subject to causes and conditions. If one is enchanted by equanimity
and wishes to indulge in it, one cannot escape the <em>dukkha</em> of
conditioned phenomena. The commentaries elaborate by stating that
neutral feeling (<em>upekkhā-vedanā</em>), along with all other formations in
the three planes of existence (<em>tebhūmaka</em>) are <em>saṅkhāra-dukkhatā</em>, as
they are oppressed by arising and dissolution. In sum, all three kinds
of feeling are incorporated in these three kinds of <em>dukkha</em>.</p>
<p>The teaching of Dependent Origination reveals how dynamics inherent in
nature develop into human problems as a consequence of ignorance,
craving, and clinging. At the same time, these natural dynamics reveal
how the interrelatedness of phenomena takes the form of a stream.
Various aspects of this stream may be distinguished: conditioned
phenomena are interrelated; they exist dependent on other conditioned
phenomena; they are inconstant, not remaining the same even for an
instant; they are not autonomous – they have no true ‘self’; and they
have no first cause.</p>
<p>Seen from another angle, the way in which phenomena manifest in the
world – as appearing, growing, and declining – reveals their fluid
nature. This fluid nature exists because things are made up of
interrelated components. The stream of phenomena flows on because all of
its components are unstable, inconstant, and without true substance. The
particular features of interdependent processes both point to the
impossibility of a first cause and also allow for the manifestation of
distinct fluid entities.</p>
<p>If things were to truly possess a ‘self’, they would be stable. If
things were stable, even for a moment, they would by definition not be
mutually dependent, and there would be no fluid entities. But, without a
stream of interdependent phenomena, nature would not exist in the way it
does. A ‘self’ or fixed substance within phenomena would render true
causal interactions impossible. Because all things are impermanent,
inconstant, subject to decay, insubstantial, and interconnected, there
is a stream of conditions manifesting as distinct natural phenomena.</p>
<p>The Pali term for impermanence and instability is <em>aniccatā</em>. The term
for oppression through birth and decay, for inherent stress, conflict
and imperfection, is <em>dukkhatā</em>. The term for ‘selflessness’ or
insubstantiality – the absence of any internal or external essence or
agent that dictates things according to desire – is <em>anattatā</em>. The
teaching of Dependent Origination reveals these three characteristics
and describes the interrelated sequence of phenomena. {162}</p>
<p>The process of Dependent Origination applies to both material things
(<em>rūpa-dhamma</em>) and to immaterial things (<em>nāma-dhamma</em>), to both the
material world and to human life, which is comprised of both physical
and mental attributes. This process manifests as particular laws of
nature: (1) <em>dhamma-niyāma</em>: the general law of cause and effect; (2)
<em>utu-niyāma</em>: laws of the material world (physical laws); (3)
<em>bīja-niyāma</em>: laws governing living things, including genetics
(biological laws); (4) <em>citta-niyāma</em>: laws governing the workings of
the mind (psychological laws); and (5) <em>kamma-niyāma</em>: law of ‘kamma’
(intentional action; kammic laws)<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn21">21</a></sup>, which deter-mines human
wellbeing and is directly linked to ethics.</p>
<p>Again, all natural processes, including the dynamics of kamma, are
possible because things are impermanent and insubstantial. This fact may
be at odds with how people commonly feel. Yet if things were permanent,
stable, and possessed a solid core, none of the above laws of nature
would hold true. Also, these laws confirm that there is no first cause
for things, no creator God.</p>
<p>Conditioned things arise dependent on causes and they are interrelated;
they have no fixed core. A bed, to take a simple example, is composed of
various parts which have been assembled following a prescribed plan;
there exists no essential substance of the bed apart from these
components. Taking these components apart, the bed no longer exists;
there exists merely a notion of ‘bed’, which is a thought in the mind.
Even particular notions do not exist in isolation, but are connected to
other concepts. The notion of a ‘bed’ only has significance in relation
to the notions of ‘lying down’, a ‘level plane’, ‘position’, ‘space’,
etc.</p>
<p>People’s awareness and understanding of particular designations is
linked to their understanding of the relational factors of that
particular entity. But when recognition of the object has been made,
habitual attachment in the form of craving and grasping leads the person
to be convinced of the object’s substantiality. The object is separated
from its relational context and true discernment of the object is
obstructed. Selfishness and possessiveness come to the fore.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, things do not have a ‘first cause’ or original
source. Tracing back the causes and conditions <em>ad infinitum</em>, one still
cannot find a first cause. There is a strong impulse in people, however,
to seek an original source for phenomena, and as a consequence they
assign undue importance to particular entities. This impulse to find a
source conflicts with the truth, and the notions associated with
whatever is taken as a source become a form of ‘perceptual aberration’
(<em>saññā-vipallāsa</em>).</p>
<p>People abandon their inquiry into causality too soon. A correct
investigation would go on to inquire into the cause of what is being
taken as the source and conclude that this line of inquiry is endless.
Things exist in mutual dependence, and therefore there is no ‘first
cause’. Indeed, one can pose the question: Why is it necessary for
things to originate from a primal source? {163}</p>
<p>The belief in a creator God is equally at odds with nature. This belief
stems from the observation and common assumption that human beings are
responsible for producing things like tools, implements and crafts;
therefore, everything in the universe must also have a creator.</p>
<p>The logic of this reasoning, however, is flawed. People separate the act
of production from the natural context of conditionality. In fact, human
production is only one aspect of conditionality. In the act of
production, humans are one factor among many in a conditional process,
all of which combine to reach a desired result. The distinction here
from a purely material process is that mental factors (e.g. ‘desire’)
accompanied by intention also play a role. But these mental factors must
combine with other factors in a conditional process to bring about a
desired end. For example, when building a house, a person influences
other factors to bring about completion. If humans were above the
conditional process, they could build a house out of thin air, but this
is impossible. Creation, therefore, is not separate from conditionality,
and since all conditioned things exist as parts of an ongoing causal
process, a creator God plays no role at any stage.</p>
<p>Another line of reasoning that contradicts the truth and is similar to
the idea of a ‘first cause’ is the idea that in the beginning there was
nothing. This idea is connected to and stems from a belief in self: the
identification with composite parts that comprise an individual form. A
person establishes a notion of self and attaches to this notion. In
addition, he may believe that originally this self did not exist, but
rather came into being at a later time.</p>
<p>This limited way of thinking, of getting stuck on an object and not
having a fluid outlook on things, is an attachment to conventional
labels and a misunderstanding of conventional truth. It lies behind the
need to find a first cause or creator God as the source of all
phenomena, giving rise to such conflicting ideas as how can something
immortal produce something that is mortal or how can transient things
spring from the eternal? In relation to the causal, interrelated flow of
phenomena, there is no need to speak of an enduring or a temporary
‘self’, unless one is referring to ‘conventional truth’
(<em>sammati-sacca</em>). Again, one can ask why is it necessary to have
nothing before something can exist?</p>
<p>In any case, speculation on such topics as a ‘first cause’ and a creator
God is considered to be of little value in Buddha-Dhamma because it is
irrelevant to the practical application of the teachings for bringing
about true spiritual wellbeing. Even though these philosophical
considerations can lead to a broad worldview, as shown above, they can
be passed over since a focus on practical application leads to the same
benefits. Attention here, therefore, should be on applying the teachings
to everyday life. {164}</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, human beings are comprised of the five aggregates.
Nothing exists separately from these aggregates, dwelling either inside
them or out. Nothing owns or controls the aggregates and governs life.
The five aggregates function according to Dependent Origination; they
are part of the interrelated flow of conditions. All of the components
in this process are unstable; they all arise and pass away, and they
condition further arising and decay. The interdependency of the
components enables there to be a causal process and continual stream of
formations.</p>
<p>The five aggregates are marked by the three universal characteristics
(<em>tilakkhaṇa</em>): (1) they are impermanent and unstable, subject to
constant arising and passing away (= <em>aniccatā</em>); (2) they are
continually oppressed by arising and dissolution; they inevitably
produce suffering for one who engages with them by way of ignorance and
attachment (= <em>dukkhatā</em>); and (3) they are void of any substantial
essence or self that is able to dictate things according to desire (=
<em>anattatā</em>).</p>
<p>These five aggregates, perpetually shifting and inherently
insubstantial, follow their own nature and proceed according to the flow
of interrelated conditions. Unawakened human beings, however, make the
mistake of resisting this flow, by identifying with certain phenomena.
They then want this imagined ‘fixed entity’ to last or proceed in a
desired fashion. At the same time, the eddying currents within the flow
of conditions conflict with desire, causing stress and increasing desire
and attachment. When desire is thwarted, the struggle to establish,
control, and stabilize an identity becomes more intense, which results
in ever greater disappointment, anguish, and despair.</p>
<p>A dim understanding of truth may lead a person to conclude that change
is inescapable and that one’s cherished ‘self’ may disappear, but this
consideration only leads to firmer attachment intertwined with
deep-seated anxiety. Such a state of mind is comprised of three
defilements: <em>avijjā</em> (ignorance of the truth; the mistaken belief in a
‘self’); <em>taṇhā</em> (the wish for this surmised ‘self’ to be or not to be
in a particular way); and <em>upādāna</em> (grasping; binding this ‘self’ to
things). These defilements are deeply embedded in the mind and they
control the behaviour of human beings, overtly or covertly. They mould
people’s personalities and shape their destiny. It is fair to say they
are the source of suffering for all unawakened people.</p>
<p>The preceding paragraphs have revealed a conflict between two distinct
processes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The course of life that is governed by the law of the Three
Characteristics (<em>anicca</em>, <em>dukkha</em> &amp; <em>anattā</em>), which is a fixed
law of nature. It manifests as birth, aging and death, both in an
ordinary and a deeper sense.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn22">22</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignorance of the course of life; the mistaken belief in a stable,
enduring ‘self’ and a subsequent attachment, accompanied by fear and
anxiety. {165}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The conflict is between laws of nature and a mistaken self-view, between
the causal dynamics in nature and people’s desires. People construct a
self which then impedes the flow of nature. When people’s desires are
unsound or thwarted, the result is suffering in its various
manifestations. This results in a life of ignorance, attachment,
enslavement, resistance to nature, and misery.</p>
<p>Conventionally speaking, the second process comprises two ‘selves’.
First is the ‘self’ or ‘entity’ within nature that changes according to
causes and conditions. Although no true ‘self’ exists, it is possible to
separate and distinguish one natural dynamic or flow from other natural
dynamics, and for practical purposes one can assign a conventional label
of ‘self’ to each individual dynamic. Second is a false ‘self’, a ‘fixed
entity’, which one imagines to be real and clings to with ignorance,
craving and grasping. The first ‘self’, the dynamic entity, is not a
cause for attachment. But the second ‘self’, which is superimposed on
the first ‘self’, is defined by attachment; it is inevitably undermined
by the nature of the first ‘self’ and thus causes suffering.</p>
<p>A life of ignorance and attachment instils fear and anxiety in the
heart, affects behaviour, and makes people unwitting slaves to their
desires. It increases selfishness (a perpetual search for personal
gratification), possessiveness, and a lack of consideration for
others.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>In order to reinforce and affirm their desires, people latch onto and
identify with those views, opinions, doctrines, belief systems, etc.,
that meet the needs of and accord with desire. They cherish and cling to
these views, etc. as if protecting their very selves. As a result, they
build a barrier that prevents them from accessing the truth: they hide
from the truth. This rigidity of mind means that their critical
faculties are impaired. And it can give rise to obstinacy – an
inability to tolerate or listen to the views of others.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>When people establish ideas, views, and beliefs on what is good, what
should be achieved, and what is the proper way to reach desired goals,
they behave accordingly, and they observe corresponding traditions and
customs. Their behaviour may even be naive or irrational as a result;
they may act simply out of an attachment to such traditions and customs,
possessing only a faint understanding of the causal relationship of the
factors involved. Hence, they lack a clear understanding of cause and
effect. {166}</p>
<p>This is reflected in the lives of some religious seekers, who uphold
various ascetic traditions and practices with great intensity, believing
that such behaviour will guarantee liberation, realization, or a passage
to heaven. They then go on to criticize and look down on other people as
a consequence of these established practices.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, on a deeper level, such people are worried about the
preservation of their cherished ‘self’, which is a fabricated concept.
Although they do not really know what or where this assumed self is,
they still lug it around and protect it. And because they fear that at
any moment the self may perish, they grab after whatever provides a
sense of self-affirmation, however obscure such things may be. Life thus
becomes restricted and their wellbeing is shaped by the fortunes of this
so-called ‘self’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>These repercussions do not merely affect the individual: the conflict
and suffering extends outwards, causing social conflict. All social
problems created by human beings stem from a life of ignorance and
attachment.</p>
<p>The detailed presentation of Dependent Origination outlines the origin
of a life of suffering; it outlines the origin of a sense of self, which
inevitably results in suffering. Breaking the chain of Dependent
Origination is to end a life of suffering, to eradicate all suffering
arising from a ‘self’. This leads to a life of wisdom, non-attachment,
freedom, and harmony with nature.</p>
<p>A life of wisdom – of direct knowledge of the truth – entails deriving
benefit from one’s relationship to nature, which is equivalent to living
in harmony with nature. To live in harmony with nature is to live freely
and with non-attachment: an escape from craving and grasping. And a life
of non-attachment relies on a knowledge of conditionality, along with an
appropriate relationship to things.</p>
<p>Buddhist teachings do not recognize a supernatural entity existing above
nature and having power over it. If something were to exist beyond
nature – to transcend nature – then by definition it could have no
influence over nature. Whatever is involved in nature is a part of
nature. {167} Natural phenomena exist according to causes and
conditions; they do not arise haphazardly. All amazing occurrences that
appear as miracles or marvels arise from and proceed according to causes
and conditions. We call these events miracles because the causes and
conditions remain hidden; as soon as the causes and conditions are
known, the sense of wonder disappears. The terms ‘supernatural’ and
‘preternatural’ are merely ways of speaking; they do not refer to some
thing that exists apart from nature.</p>
<p>A related subject is the distinction between ‘man’ and ‘nature’. The
expressions ‘man and nature’ or ‘man controls nature’ are simply figures
of speech. In fact, human beings are one part of nature, and humans can
control nature only to the extent that they exist as one condition in
nature, influencing subsequent conditions and giving rise to particular
results.</p>
<p>What is unique in the case of human interaction is the involvement of
mental conditions, including volition, and therefore the term ‘creation’
is used for human activities. But all the elements in the act of
creation are, without exception, conditional factors. Human beings are
unable to create anything out of thin air or in isolation, as somehow
separate from the conditional process. When humans understand the
requisite conditions leading to desired results, they enter the process
as one determinant factor, shaping other conditions to reach a desired
end.</p>
<p>There are two stages to successful interaction: the first is knowledge
and the second is to act as a condition for subsequent conditions. The
initial stage, equivalent to wisdom, is essential. With wisdom, one can
engage with things according to one’s wishes. A wise engagement with
things entails benefiting from one’s relationship to nature, or even
controlling nature, and this benefit extends to a person’s relationship
to both material things and the mind. Because human beings and nature
exist in a mutual relationship, to live wisely is to live in harmony
with nature. With wisdom, one has control over one’s mental faculties,
control over one’s mind: one has control over oneself.</p>
<p>A life of wisdom has two dimensions: internally, wise persons are calm,
clear and joyous. When encountering pleasant objects, they are not
seduced or reckless. When separated from delightful objects, they are
not upset or despondent. They do not entrust their happiness to material
things by allowing these things to govern their lives. And externally,
they are fluent and agile; they are prepared to engage with things
appropriately and reasonably. There are no inner attachments or
fixations that cause obstruction, prejudice, or confusion. {168}</p>
<p>The following words by the Buddha demonstrate the difference between a
life of attachment and a life of wisdom:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling feels a pleasant feeling, a
painful feeling, and a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. The
instructed noble disciple too feels a pleasant feeling, a painful
feeling, and a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. In this case,
bhikkhus, what is the distinction, the disparity, the difference
between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling?</p>
<p>Bhikkhus, when the uninstructed worldling is contacted by a painful
feeling, he grieves and laments; he weeps beating his breast and
becomes distraught. He feels two feelings – bodily feeling and mental
feeling. Suppose an archer were to strike a man with an arrow, and
then strike him afterwards with a second arrow, so that the man would
feel a feeling caused by two arrows. So too, when the uninstructed
worldling is contacted by a painful feeling ... he feels two feelings
– a bodily one and a mental one.</p>
<p>Being contacted by that painful feeling, he harbours aversion towards
it. When he harbours aversion towards painful feeling, the underlying
tendency to aversion towards painful feeling lies behind this. Being
contacted by painful feeling, he seeks delight in sense pleasure.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn27">27</a></sup>
For what reason? Because the uninstructed worldling does not know of
any escape from painful feeling other than by sense pleasure. When he
seeks delight in sensual pleasure, the underlying tendency to lust for
pleasant feeling lies behind this. He does not understand as it really
is the origin and the passing away, the gratification, the danger, and
the escape in the case of these feelings. When he does not understand
these things, the underlying tendency to ignorance in regard to
neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling lies behind this.</p>
<p>If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it as one bound. If he feels
a painful feeling, he feels it as one bound. If he feels a
neither-painful-nor-pleasant felling, he feels it as one bound. This,
bhikkhus, is called an uninstructed worldling who is bound<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn28">28</a></sup> by
birth, aging and death; who is bound by sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief and despair; who is bound by suffering, I say. {169}</p>
<p>Bhikkhus, when the instructed noble disciple is contacted by a painful
feeling, he does not grieve or lament. He does not weep beating his
breast and become distraught. He feels one feeling – a bodily
feeling, not a mental feeling. Suppose an archer were to strike a man
with one arrow, but the second arrow would miss the mark, so that the
man would feel a feeling caused by one arrow only. So too, when the
instructed noble disciple is contacted by a painful feeling ... he
feels one feeling – a bodily one, not a mental one.</p>
<p>Being contacted by that painful feeling, he harbours no aversion
towards it. Since he harbours no aversion towards painful feeling, the
underlying tendency to aversion towards painful feeling does not lie
behind this. Being contacted by painful feeling, he does not seek
delight in sensual pleasure. For what reason? Because the instructed
noble disciple knows of an escape from painful feeling other than
sensual pleasure. Since he does not seek delight in sensual pleasure,
the underlying tendency to lust for pleasant feeling does not lie
behind this. He understands as it really is the origin and the passing
away, the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of
these feelings. Since he understands these things, the underlying
tendency to ignorance in regard to neither-painful-nor-pleasant
feeling does not lie behind this.</p>
<p>If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached. If he feels a
painful feeling, he feels it detached. If he feels a
neither-painful-nor-pleasant felling, he feels it detached. This,
bhikkhus, is called a noble disciple who is free from birth, aging and
death; who is free from sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair;
who is free from suffering, I say.</p>
<p>This, bhikkhus, is the distinction, the disparity, the difference
between the instructed noble disciple and the uninstructed worldling.</p>

<p>Second, here are the formal, doctrinal definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Avijjā</em>: ignorance of suffering, of the origin of suffering, of the
cessation of suffering, and of the way leading to the cessation of
suffering (the Four Noble Truths), and according to the Abhidhamma,
ignorance of the past, of the future, of the past and future, and of
Dependent Origination.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn31">31</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Saṅkhāra</em>: Bodily volition (<em>kāya-saṅkhāra</em>), verbal volition
(<em>vacī-saṅkhāra</em>), and mental volition (<em>citta-saṅkhāra</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn32">32</a></sup> and
according to the Abhidhamma, meritorious volition
(<em>puññābhisaṅkhāra</em>), demeritorious volition (<em>apuññābhisaṅkhāra</em>),
and imperturbability-producing volition (<em>āneñjābhisaṅkhāra</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn33">33</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Viññāṇa</em>: the six kinds of consciousness: eye-consciousness
(<em>cakkhu-viññāṇa</em>), ear-consciousness (<em>sota-viññāṇa</em>),
nose-consciousness (<em>ghāna-viññāṇa</em>), tongue-consciousness
(<em>jivhā-viññāṇa</em>), body-consciousness (<em>kāya-viññāṇa</em>), and

intention (<em>cetanā</em>), contact (<em>phassa</em>), and attention
(<em>manasikāra</em>); and ‘body’: the four great elements (<em>mahābhūta</em>)
and form that depends on these four great elements. The Abhidhamma
defines ‘name’ as the feeling aggregate (<em>vedanā-khandha</em>), the
perception aggregate (<em>saññā-khandha</em>), and the volitional formation
aggregate (<em>saṅkhāra-khandha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn35">35</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Saḷāyatana</em>: the six sense bases: eye (<em>cakkhu</em>), ear (<em>sota</em>),

craving for sounds (<em>sadda-taṇhā</em>), craving for smells
(<em>gandha-taṇhā</em>), craving for tastes (<em>rasa-taṇhā</em>), craving for
tactile objects (<em>phoṭṭhabba-taṇhā</em>), and craving for mind objects
(<em>dhamma-taṇhā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn38">38</a></sup></p>

sensuality: to forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile objects);
<em>diṭṭhupādāna</em> (grasping onto views, ideals, theories, and beliefs);
<em>sīlabbatupādāna</em> (grasping onto rules and practices, believing that
in themselves they lead to spiritual purity); and <em>attavādupādāna</em>
(grasping onto ‘self’; creating a false idea of self and then
clinging to this idea).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhava</em>: the three spheres of existence: the sense-sphere
(<em>kāma-bhava</em>), the fine-material sphere (<em>rūpa-bhava</em>); and the
immaterial sphere (<em>arūpa-bhava</em>). Alternatively: (1) the sphere of
‘kamma’ (<em>kamma-bhava</em>) – the active process of becoming
(equivalent to meritorious volition, demeritorious volition, and

sphere of one-constituent being (<em>ekavokāra-bhava</em>), the sphere of
four-constituent being (<em>catuvokāra-bhava</em>), and the sphere of
five-constituent being (<em>pañcavokāra-bhava</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn40">40</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Jāti</em>: the birth of the five aggregates; the arising of the sense
spheres (<em>āyatana</em>). Alternatively, ‘the arising of these various
phenomena.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn41">41</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Jarāmaraṇa</em>: <em>jarā</em> (aging; weakening of the faculties), and
<em>maraṇa</em> (death; the breaking up of the aggregates; an end of the
‘life faculty’ – <em>jīvitindriya</em>). Alternatively, ‘the degeneration
and dissolution of these various phenomena.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn42">42</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="header" href="#general-explanations" id="general-explanations">General Explanations</a></h3>
<p>Here are several examples that give a brief and simple explanation for
these factors of Dependent Origination:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Āsava → avijjā:</em></p>
<p>The belief that going to heaven is the highest happiness; the belief
that killing others will bring happiness; the belief that suicide
will bring happiness; the belief that birth as a Brahma god will
bring immortality; the belief that heaven is reached by making
propitiatory offerings; the belief that Nibbāna is reached by
undertaking austerities; the belief that there is a presently
existing self that will be reborn as a result of certain actions;
the belief that nothing exists after death. Thence:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>→ Saṅkhāra:</em></p>
<p>Thinking and inclining in the direction of, or in accord with, such
beliefs (above); conceiving modes of conduct and action (<em>kamma</em>)
based on such thoughts and intentions; these actions may be good
(<em>puñña</em>), bad (<em>apuñña</em> or <em>pāpa</em>), or ‘imperturbable’ (<em>āneñja</em> –
see <em>āneñjābhisaṅkhāra</em>, above). Thence:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>→ Viññāṇa:</em></p>
<p>Awareness and cognition of sense impressions that specifically
conform to such intentions. A consciousness with particular
qualities is generated. {173} At death, the force of volitional
formations (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) – of created kamma – induces
rebirth-linking consciousness (<em>paṭisandhi-viññāṇa</em>), with
appropriate properties, to take rebirth in a plane of existence
suited to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>→ Nāma-rūpa:</em></p>
<p>Birth leads to a body and a life that is prepared to perform
subsequent kamma. There arise the body aggregate (<em>rūpa-khandha</em>),
the feeling aggregate (<em>vedanā-khandha</em>), the perception aggregate
(<em>saññā-khandha</em>), and the volitional formation aggregate
(<em>saṅkhāra-khandha</em>), which possess the properties and deficiencies
endowed in them by the force of previously generated kamma. These
aggregates are also conditioned by the nature of the particular
plane of existence, depending on birth say as a human being, an
animal, or a celestial being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>→ Saḷāyatana:</em></p>
<p>In order to respond to the external world, to enable cognition, and
to satisfy personal needs there must be a channel for associating
with the external world. With the support of ‘mind &amp; body’
(<em>nāma-rūpa</em>), life proceeds according to the force of kamma
(’kammic momentum’) to the point where there arise the six senses:
the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and the mind, which cognizes
internal phenomena.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>→ Phassa:</em></p>
<p>Cognition takes place by the contact or coming together of three
factors: the internal sense bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and
mind), the external sense objects (sights, sounds, smells, tastes,
tactile objects, and mind objects), and consciousness (eye-, ear-,
nose-, tongue-, body-, and mind-consciousness). With cognition:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>→ Vedanā:</em></p>
<p>There arises feeling (or ‘sensation’), either as pleasure
(<em>sukha-vedanā</em>), pain (<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>), or a neutral feeling
(<em>adukkhamasukha-vedanā</em> or <em>upekkhā-vedanā</em>). For unawakened
beings, the process does not end here; as a consequence:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>→ Taṇhā:</em></p>
<p>When experiencing pleasure, there is delight, covetousness, and
greed. When experiencing pain or discomfort, there is aversion,
annoyance, and hostility. A person is agitated and wishes for the
feeling to disappear. He wishes to escape from the painful object,
seeking to replace it with a pleasurable object. Alternatively, a
person experiences a neutral feeling, of indifference, which is a
subtle feeling classified as a form of pleasure, since there is no
aversion. It is a mild feeling of ease. Thence:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>→ Upādāna:</em></p>
<p>When desire is heightened, there is grasping. A person becomes
attached to and preoccupied with an object. Before an object is
acquired there is craving; after the object is acquired there is
grasping. Grasping is not confined to desirable sense objects
(<em>kāmupādāna</em>), but extends to associated views and opinions
(<em>diṭṭhupādāna</em>), to ways of practice for acquiring desired objects
(<em>sīlabbatupādāna</em>), and to a sense of self (<em>attavādupādāna</em>).
These different forms of grasping are linked. As a consequence,
there is:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>→ Bhava:</em></p>
<p>The intention to act in response to the aforementioned grasping.
This intention, which conforms to the specific craving and grasping,
leads to the entire range of behaviour (the active process of
becoming – <em>kamma-bhava</em>), as good, bad, or ‘imperturbable’
(<em>āneñja</em>). For example, a person may wish to go to heaven and
believes that certain actions will lead to this end, and thus
performs these actions. At the same time, he or she prepares the
‘conditions for existence’ – the five aggregates – that will
appear in the state of existence befitting that kamma (the passive
process of becoming – <em>uppatti-bhava</em>). When creation of kamma
operates in this way, at the moment when a lifespan ends, the force
of the accumulated kamma (<em>kamma-bhava</em>) impels the next stage of
the cycle: {174}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>→ Jāti:</em></p>
<p>Starting with rebirth-linking consciousness (<em>paṭisandhi-viññāṇa</em>),
which conforms to the ‘kammic momentum’, there is birth in a realm
of existence appropriate to that kamma. The five aggregates arise
and life begins: ‘mind &amp; body’, the six sense bases, contact, and
feeling arise and the wheel of Dependent Origination continues. With
birth, there is certain to be:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>→ Jarāmaraṇa:</em></p>
<p>Deterioration and destruction of life. For unawakened people, aging
and death are constantly felt as threatening and oppressive, both
overtly and subconsciously. Therefore, in the life of ordinary
people, aging and death are linked to:</p>
<p>... <em>Soka-parideva-dukkha-domanassa-upāyāsa</em> (sorrow, lamentation,
pain, grief, and despair), which collectively are referred to as
‘suffering’. The concluding line of Dependent Origination is thus:
‘Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.’</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As Dependent Origination exists as a cycle, this stage of sorrow, etc.
is not the end. In fact, this collection of qualities becomes another
important factor causing the cycle to rotate further. Sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief, and despair reveal the existence of mental
impurities called <em>āsava</em> that fester in the heart.</p>
<p>There are four such impurities or ‘taints’:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Kāmāsava</em>: The desire for gratification by way of the five senses
and by way of the mind;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhāsava</em>: The holding fast to certain beliefs, like ‘I am the
body’ or ‘this body is mine’;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhavāsava</em>: Satisfaction in a particular state of existence,
considering it superior, precious, and happy; the wish that one can
abide in such a state and experience joy forever;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Avijjāsava</em>: Ignorance of things as they are.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aging and death are the marks of decline and decay, and they run counter
to these mental impurities. For example, in regard to sensuality, aging
and death lead people to feel that they will be separated from
pleasurable, desired sense objects. In regard to views, when one
identifies with the body, one grieves when it changes. In regard to
‘becoming’, one fears that one will miss the opportunity to abide in a
desired state of existence. And in regard to ignorance, one lacks basic
understanding, of say the nature of aging and the proper course of
conduct in relation to it. When a person who lacks proper understanding
thinks of or encounters aging and death, he or she experiences fear and
gloom and behaves in a misguided way. The ‘taints’ thus act as fuel,
giving rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair the moment a
person contacts aging and death.</p>
<p>Sorrow, lamentation, etc., also reveal mental obscurity. Whenever these
negative emotions are present, the mind is dim and dull. When one of
these mind states arises, it is accompanied by ignorance, as confirmed
by the Visuddhimagga:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Sorrow, pain, grief and despair are inseparable from ignorance, and
lamentation is found in one who is deluded. So when these are
established, ignorance is established; <em>Vism. 576.</em></p>
<p>This is how ignorance should be understood to be established by sorrow
and so on; <em>Vism. 577.</em></p>
<p>As long as these [sorrow, etc.] go on occurring so long does
ignorance occur. <em>Vism. 529.</em></p>
<p>Therefore it is said: ‘With the arising of the taints there is the
arising of ignorance’. <em>M. I. 54.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>One can conclude that for unawakened persons, aging and death, with
their retinue of sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, are a
condition for the arising of ignorance, providing the next link in the
cycle of Dependent Origination, without interruption. {175}</p>
<p>Several important points may be made concerning the previous
explanations:</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> The cycle of Dependent Origination as explained above is usually
called the ‘wheel of becoming’ (<em>bhava-cakka</em>) or the ‘wheel of rebirth’
(<em>saṁsāra-cakka</em>), and it covers three distinct lifetimes: ignorance
(<em>avijjā</em>) and volitional formations (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) comprise one lifespan;
consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>) to becoming (<em>bhava</em>) comprise another
lifespan; and birth (<em>jāti</em>) and aging &amp; death (<em>jarā-maraṇa</em>; along
with sorrow, lamentation, etc.) comprise a third lifespan. By
determining the middle interval (consciousness to becoming) as the
present life, the three stages (containing twelve factors) can be
connected to three periods of time:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Past life = ignorance and volitional formations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present life = consciousness, mind &amp; body, the six sense bases,
contact, feeling, craving, grasping, and becoming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future life = birth and aging &amp; death (with sorrow, lamentation,
etc.).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> In this three-life division, the present life is considered the
principal period of time. The relationship of the past to the present is
only viewed in the light of causal factors; the results manifesting in
the present are traced back to the causes in the past (past causes →
present results). Similarly, the view to the future pertains to results;
present causes are linked to future results (present causes → future
results). Therefore, only the present contains both results and causes;
this relationship of cause and effect can be depicted as four
stages:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn43">43</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Past causes (<em>atīta-hetu</em>) = ignorance and volitional formations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present results (<em>pacuppanna-phala</em>) = consciousness, mind &amp; body,
the six sense bases, contact, and feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present causes (<em>pacuppanna-hetu</em>) = craving, grasping, and
becoming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future results (<em>anāgata-phala</em>) = birth and aging &amp; death (with
sorrow, lamentation, etc.).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> From the explanations of each factor above, it is evident that
some definitions for these factors overlap or correspond with one
another. The factors can thus be grouped as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ignorance (<em>avijjā</em>) with craving &amp; grasping (<em>taṇhā</em> &amp; <em>upādāna</em>):</p>
<p>In the general explanations of ignorance above it is clear that
craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) and grasping (<em>upādāna</em>), especially grasping onto
a sense of self, are inherent in each example. When a person does
not understand the truth and mistakenly identifies with a ‘self’,
there will be selfish desires and attachments. In the phrase, ‘With
the arising of the taints there is the arising of ignorance’, the
taints of sense-desire, becoming, and views (<em>kāmāsava</em>,
<em>bhavāsava</em>, and <em>diṭṭhāsava</em>) are all connected to craving and
grasping. Therefore, whenever ignorance is mentioned, there is
always a link to craving and grasping.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the explanations of craving and grasping there is
always a link to ignorance. When there is an identification with
‘self’, there is craving and grasping. The many forms of selfishness
stem from not knowing the truth of conditioned phenomena. The more
people generate desire and attachment, the more impaired are their
critical faculties. They increasingly fail to apply mindfulness and
wisdom, and their true discernment of things decreases. {176}</p>
<p>Therefore, ignorance as a past cause and craving &amp; grasping as
present causes have essentially the same meaning. The reason
ignorance is used in the past and craving &amp; grasping are used in the
present is to show the chief determining factors in different
sections of the cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volitional formations (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) with becoming (<em>bhava</em>):</p>
<p>The definitions for <em>saṅkhāra</em> and <em>bhava</em> are almost identical. The
difference lies in the principal agent that is emphasized or in the
range of focus. The definition for <em>saṅkhāra</em> emphasizes intention,
which is the principal agent behind action (<em>kamma</em>). The definition
for <em>bhava</em> is broader, distinguishing between the active process of
becoming (<em>kamma-bhava</em>) and the passive process of becoming
(<em>uppatti-bhava</em>). The active process of becoming also has intention
as the principal agent (like <em>saṅkhāra</em>), but the term <em>kamma-bhava</em>
has a wider meaning than <em>saṅkhāra</em>, encompassing the entire range
of human behaviour. The passive process of becoming refers to the
five aggregates, arising from the active process of becoming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consciousness (<em>viññāṇa</em>) to feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) with birth and aging
&amp; death (<em>jāti</em> &amp; <em>jarāmaraṇa</em>; and sorrow, lamentation, etc.):</p>
<p>The factors of consciousness to feeling refer to results in this
life. The reason these factors are listed in detail here is to show
how present resultant factors interact and produce present causal
factors, which then lead to future results.</p>
<p>Birth and aging &amp; death, as future results, demonstrate that when
present causal factors exist, there will inevitably be future
results. <em>Jāti</em> and <em>jarāmaraṇa</em> are here used only as a summary,
referring to the arising and ceasing of consciousness, mind &amp; body,
the six sense bases, contact, and feeling. And they are used to
emphasize the arising of suffering, to reveal the point linking the
process to the beginning (at ignorance). Therefore, the factors of
consciousness to feeling and the dual factors of birth and aging &amp;
death are essentially the same and can be used interchangeably.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By integrating these matching definitions, each stage in the group of
four causes and results (see above) comprises five factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Five past causes: ignorance, volitional formations, craving,
grasping, and becoming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five present results: consciousness, mind &amp; body, the six sense
bases, contact and feeling (= birth and aging &amp; death).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five present causes: ignorance, volitional formations, craving,
grasping, and becoming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five future results: consciousness, mind &amp; body, the six sense
bases, contact and feeling (= birth and aging &amp; death).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Compiled in this way, these factors are known as the twenty ‘conditions’
(<em>ākāra</em>).</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> In accord with the preceding definitions, it is possible to
classify the twelve factors of Dependent Origination into three groups,
which are called the three rounds (<em>vaṭṭa</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ignorance, craving, grasping are defilements (<em>kilesa</em>). They are
the causes behind thinking and acting. This group is called the
round of defilement (<em>kilesa-vaṭṭa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volitional formations and becoming (i.e. the active process of
becoming – <em>kamma-bhava</em>) refer to actions (<em>kamma</em>) that shape the
course of life. They are known as the round of intentional action
(<em>kamma-vaṭṭa</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consciousness, mind &amp; body, the six sense bases, contact and feeling
are results (<em>vipāka</em>). They are the fruits of kamma, and become the
conditions for producing subsequent defilements. Collectively, they
are known as the round of results (<em>vipāka-vaṭṭa</em>). {177}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The relationship between these three rounds can be illustrated as shown
at
Figure <a href="#fig-kilesa-kamma-vipaka">Rounds of Defilements, Actions and Results</a>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">Rounds of Defilements, Actions and Results</span><a id="fig-kilesa-kamma-vipaka"></a></p>
<p><img src="./includes/images/diagrams/defilements-actions-results.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>These three rounds are depicted in the commentaries. They are a simple,
down-to-earth way of explaining Dependent Origination and the round of
rebirth. For example, a person may act prompted by defilement in order
to acquire a desired object. If the result of this action is a
pleasurable feeling, desire is increased, leading to further actions and
results. If, however, a person’s actions do not lead to the desired
object, the result is an unpleasant feeling; a defilement in the form of
anger arises, which becomes an additional result of the person’s
actions.</p>
<p><strong>(5)</strong> As mental defilements are the source of various forms of kamma,
shaping the course of life, defilements are thus designated as the
beginning of the cycle. Following this designation, there are two
starting points to the cycle, known as the two roots (<em>mūla</em>) of the
wheel of becoming (<em>bhava-cakka</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ignorance is the starting point from the past, influencing the
present up to feeling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craving is the starting point in the present, resulting from feeling
and influencing the future up to aging and death.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned earlier, these two factors are the prominent defilements in
each respective stage: ignorance follows from sorrow, lamentation, etc.,
while craving follows from feeling (see
Note <a href="#note-two-roots">Two Roots</a>).</p>
<div class="note">
<p><span class="caption">Two Roots</span><a id="note-two-roots"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The commentaries state the different purposes for distinguishing and
explaining these two ‘roots’: <em>avijjā</em> refers to people who are
opinionated (<em>diṭṭhi-carita</em>); <em>taṇhā</em> refers to people who are greedy
(<em>taṇhā-carita</em>). Alternatively, the section with ignorance as root is
used to eliminate an annihilationist view, whereas the section with
craving as root is used to eliminate the eternalist view; or, the
former section refers to beings who dwell in the womb, while the
latter refers to spontaneously born beings. See: Vism. 578.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In reference to rebirth, the orthodox explanation distinguishes between
the case wherein ignorance is prominent and that wherein craving is
prominent, as follows:</p>
<p>Ignorance is a primary agent causing beings to be reborn in a bad
destination (<em>duggati</em>). When ignorance dominates the mind, people are
unable to distinguish between good and evil, right and wrong, helpful
and harmful. They tend to act in a deluded and unprincipled way, opening
the door to serious misconduct.</p>
<p>The craving for existence (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>), on the other hand, induces
people to be born in good destinations (<em>sugati</em>). When such craving
leads the way, people tend to focus on the good qualities of life. When
thinking of the future, they want to be born in heaven or to be reborn
as a Brahma. In this life they seek wealth, honour, and fame. {178}</p>
<p>Prompted by such desire driven by a craving for existence, they
calculate and act to achieve their goal. In order to become a Brahma
they develop jhāna, in order to go to heaven they are generous and
morally upright, in order to be wealthy they diligently earn money, or
in order to seek honour they are charitable. With this care and effort
they are able to perform good deeds better than someone dwelling in
ignorance.</p>
<p>Although ignorance and craving are designated as ‘starting points’, they
are not a ‘first cause’:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, the beginning point of ignorance is not apparent, so that
one may say: ‘Ignorance was not before; it has since come to be.’
Concerning this matter, I say: ‘Indeed, with this as condition,
ignorance is apparent.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn44">44</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. V. 113; Vism. 525.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>There is an identical passage concerning craving for existence:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, the beginning point of craving for existence is not
apparent, so that one may say: ‘Craving for existence was not before;
it has since come to be.’ Concerning this matter, I say: ‘Indeed, with
this as condition, craving for existence is apparent.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn45">45</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. V. 116; Vism. 525.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The following passage addresses both ignorance and craving as ‘root
causes’:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, for the fool, obstructed by ignorance and bound by craving,
this body has thereby originated. As a result, there is this pair of
conditions, of body and external name-and-form. Dependent on this pair
there is contact by way of only six sense bases. The fool contacts by
way of these sense bases, or by way of one among them, and thus
experiences pleasure and pain.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn46">46</a></sup></p>
<p><em>S. II. 23-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>(6)</strong> The interconnection between the factors of Dependent Origination
corresponds to the connections collectively known as the twenty-four
‘supports’ (<em>paccaya</em>), following the explanation in the
Abhidhamma.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn47">47</a></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, each factor can be expanded upon. For example, consciousness
(or the mind) can be analyzed according to its quality (as wholesome or
unwholesome), its level, and its destination in a particular state of
existence. Similarly, form (<em>rūpa</em>) can be analyzed according to
different types, properties, and states of existence.</p>
<p>It does not seem necessary here to present these twenty-four supports or
the elaborate details for each factor. Readers who take a special
interest may investigate these matters directly in the Abhidhamma texts.
{179}</p>
<p>The preceding explanations can be illustrated as shown on
Figures <a href="#fig-dependent-stages">Past, Present and Future as Stages</a>
and <a href="#fig-dependent-cycles">Past, Present and Future as a Cycle</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>Note: The section on causal factors corresponds to ‘origin’ (<em>samudaya</em>)
in the Four Noble Truths, because these factors are the agents of
suffering. The section on results corresponds with ‘suffering’
(<em>dukkha</em>) in the Four Noble Truths. {180}</p>
<p>Alternatively, the section on causes is called active-process becoming
(<em>kamma-bhava</em>), because this process generates causes. The section on
results is called the passive process of becoming (<em>uppatti-bhava</em>),
because this process contains results.</p>
<p>There are three ‘links’ (<em>sandhi</em>) between cause (<em>hetu</em>) and effect
(<em>phala</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(the first) cause-effect link (<em>hetu-phala-sandhi</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the effect-cause link (<em>phala-hetu-sandhi</em>); and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(the second) cause-effect link (<em>hetu-phala-sandhi</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#application-in-everyday-life" id="application-in-everyday-life">Application in Everyday Life</a></h2>
<p>The previous explanations are the traditional, orthodox explanations;
they are found in the commentaries and have been passed down through the
ages. These explanations emphasize the round of rebirth (saṁsāra-vaṭṭa):
the passing from one life to another. They demonstrate the connection
between three lifetimes: the past, the present, and the future, and they
have been developed into a fixed, strictly-defined system.</p>
<p>Some people are not content with these explanations and wish to define
Dependent Origination in the context of everyday life. They cite
explanations in the Abhidhamma and the commentaries that describe the
entire sequence of Dependent Origination arising in a single
moment.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn48">48</a></sup> They can draw upon the same scriptural passages referred to
in the orthodox explanations to support their own interpretation.
Moreover, they can find evidence in other texts to substantiate their
claims. As will be seen below, this alternate explanation has
interesting and distinctive features.</p>
<p>There are many justifications for this alternate explanation. For
example, the end of suffering for an arahant occurs in this very life;
he or she does not need to die first in order to achieve this state of
peace. An arahant is not reborn: there is no aging, death, sorrow,
lamentation, etc. in a future life. Even in this life, an arahant
experiences no sorrow, lamentation, etc.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn49">49</a></sup> The complete cycle of
Dependent Origination in relation to the arising (or ceasing) of
suffering occurs in the present time; one need not trace back to a
previous life or wait for a future life. And whenever one understands
the presently occurring cycle, one also understands the cycles
incorporating the past and future, because these respective cycles are
all essentially the same.</p>
<p>The following teachings by the Buddha are referred to as corroboration
for this alternative interpretation:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Udāyin, if someone should recollect his manifold past lives ... then
either he might ask me a question about the past (pubbanta – past
life) or I might ask him a question about the past, and he might
satisfy my mind with his answer to my question or I might satisfy his
mind with my answer to his question. If someone with the divine eye
... should see beings passing away and reappearing then either he
might ask me a question about the future (aparanta – next life) or I
might ask him a question about the future, and he might satisfy my
mind with his answer to my question or I might satisfy his mind with
my answer to his question. But let be the past, Udāyin, let be the
future. I shall teach you the Dhamma: when this exists, that comes to
be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist,
that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases.
{181}</p>
<p><em>M. II. 31-2.</em></p>
<p>Bhadraka the headman approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him,
sat down to one side, and said to him: ‘It would be good, venerable
sir, if the Blessed One would teach me about the origin and the
passing away of suffering.’</p>
<p>‘If, headman, I were to teach you about the origin and the passing
away of suffering with reference to the past, saying, ‘So it was in
the past’, perplexity and uncertainty about that might arise in you.
And if I were to teach you about the origin and the passing away of
suffering with reference to the future, saying, ‘So it will be in the
future’, perplexity and uncertainty about that might arise in you.
Instead, headman, while I am sitting right here, and you are sitting
right there, I will teach you about the origin and the passing away of
suffering.’</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 327.</em></p>
<p>Some feelings, Sīvaka, arise originating from bile disorders ...
originating from phlegm disorders ... originating from wind disorders
... originating from a combination of causes ... produced by a change
of climate ... produced by irregular exercise ... caused by assault
... produced as the result of kamma. How feelings arise originating
[from the aforementioned causes] one can know for oneself, and that
is considered to be true in the world. Now when those ascetics and
brahmans hold such a doctrine and view as this, ‘Whatever feeling a
person experiences, whether it be pleasant or painful, all that is
caused by what was done in the past’,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn50">50</a></sup> they overshoot what one
knows by oneself and they overshoot what is considered to be true in
the world. Therefore I say that this is wrong on the part of those
ascetics and brahmans.</p>
<p><em>S. IV. 230-31.</em></p>
<p>Bhikkhus, what one intends, what one pays attention to, and what one
thinks about: this becomes a basis for the maintenance of
consciousness. When there is a basis there is a support for the
establishing of consciousness. When consciousness is established and
come to growth, there is the production of future renewed existence.
When there is the production of future renewed existence, future
birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair
come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>
<p><em>S. II. 65.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Although the alternative explanation of Dependent Origination has
distinctive features, it does not abandon the definitions contained in
the standard exposition. Therefore, to understand the alternative
explanation it is useful to define the factors of Dependent Origination
in this context in a way that is consistent with the standard
exposition: {182}</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#factors-of-dependent-origination-1" id="factors-of-dependent-origination-1">Factors of Dependent Origination</a></h3>
<ol>

</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="header" href="#preliminary-explanation-of-the-relationship-between-factors" id="preliminary-explanation-of-the-relationship-between-factors">Preliminary Explanation of the Relationship between Factors</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ignorance conditions volitional formations: because of not knowing
the truth and not wisely investigating different situations, people
create various mental fabrications: they speculate, fantasize, and
conceptualize in terms of established beliefs, inhibitions, and
habits, and they then determine how to speak and act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volitional formations condition consciousness: when there is
intention or the determination to engage with something,
consciousness arises: to see, to hear, to smell, to taste, to feel,
and to think about that thing. In particular, intention induces
conscious awareness to acknowledge and think about the desired
object, resulting in an endless stream of mental proliferation.
Intention also conditions a person’s state of mind, endowing it with
particular qualities, as positive or negative, virtuous or defiled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consciousness conditions mind &amp; body: consciousness is accompanied
by corresponding physical and mental attributes. Consciousness
functions in conjunction with physical and mental factors, such as
bodily organs, sensation, perception, and volitional formations.
Moreover, in whatever way consciousness has been conditioned, the
accompanying physical and mental factors function in concert with
this consciousness. For example, when consciousness has been
conditioned by angry volitional formations, accompanying perceptions
are associated with coarse language, insults, and violence. A
person’s countenance will appear sullen, his muscles will be tense,
his pulse will quicken, and he will feel stressed. When
consciousness is repeatedly conditioned in a particular way, a
person’s mental and physical attributes develop into specific
personality traits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mind-and-body conditions the six sense bases: when mind &amp; body has
been activated in a particular configuration or direction, it relies
on the support from the sense bases, which supply information or act
as channels for behaviour. The sense bases are roused to perform
their particular duty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The six sense bases condition contact: when the six sense bases
exist, contact with and cognition of sense objects is possible.
Cognition depends on the individual sense bases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact conditions feeling: with contact there must be feeling,
either pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feeling conditions craving: when experiencing a pleasing sense
object, a person feels delight; he or she becomes attached to that
object and wants more of it. Consequently, there is craving for
sense objects (<em>kāma-taṇhā</em>). One wishes to maintain or abide in a
state where one can further experience the pleasure from that
object: there arises the craving for becoming (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>). When
experiencing a painful sense object, one feels aversion; one wants
to escape from or eliminate it. Consequently, there is the craving
for extinction (<em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>). And when experiencing a neutral
object, one is indifferent, indecisive, and deluded. The object is
experienced as a mild form of pleasure, leading to attachment and a
desire for more pleasant sensations. {184}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craving conditions grasping: when desire intensifies, it leads to
attachment. The desire is lodged in the heart and a person is unable
to let go of it. This gives rise to a particular behaviour in
relation to an object. If one likes the object, one binds oneself to
it and submits to it; whatever is associated with the object is
viewed as good; whatever disturbs it is viewed as disturbing one’s
self. If one dislikes an object, one feels as if one is encountering
an opponent. One feels repulsed by and in conflict with anything
associated with this object. One sees nothing redeeming about the
object and feels personally offended by it. One’s behaviour, both in
relation to pleasing and displeasing objects, reinforces and
validates the following four things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>objects of sensual gratification (<em>kāma</em>), which are acquired or
lost;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>views and understanding of things associated with sense objects,
including one’s views on life and the world (<em>diṭṭhi</em>);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>practices, rules and customs (<em>sīlabbata</em>) maintained for
acquiring and avoiding sense objects;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a sense of a ‘self’ (<em>attavāda</em>), which acquires things or is
impeded.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grasping conditions becoming: when there is grasping and particular
ways of behaving towards objects, people, and states of mind, a
person generates a corresponding state of existence, both in regard
to general behaviour (<em>kamma-bhava</em>), beginning with patterns of
thought, and in regard to personality, which are the mental and
physical traits of that person’s life at that time
(<em>uppatti-bhava</em>). Examples of this are the distinct behaviour and
personality of people who seek material wealth, people who seek
power, people who seek fame, people who seek physical beauty, and
people who are antisocial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becoming conditions birth: with the arising of a personally occupied
state of existence, there is a sense of ‘self’: a distinct awareness
of abiding in or embodying this state of existence. A person
believes, for example, that he or she is the owner, the recipient,
the agent, the winner, or the loser in this state of existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Birth conditions aging-and-death: with the arising of a ‘self’ that
occupies a state of existence, it is natural to experience both
growth and decline within that state, including a sense of weakening
and passing away from that state. In particular, there is the threat
of perishing and the need to continually watch over and preserve
that state. The decline, loss, and threat of decay causes perpetual
grief and suffering.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Avijjā → saṅkhāra:</em></p>
<p>By not knowing the truth and not seeing clearly, a person creates
mental fabrications, speculations, and deliberations. For example, a
superstitious person may see the reflection of light from an
animal’s eyes and believe he is seeing a ghost; he becomes afraid
and runs away. In the event that an object is hidden from view, a
person may spend time guessing and arguing about the nature of this
object. A person who believes that the gods bestow blessings when
pleased will offer prayers, entreaties and propitiatory sacrifices
to them. {185} A person who does not know the true nature of
conditioned phenomena, that they are impermanent, inconstant, and
formed by causal factors, sees them as lovely and desirable, and
strives to acquire and possess them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Saṅkhāra → viññāṇa:</em></p>
<p>With intention, purpose, and deliberate engagement, a consciousness
(say of hearing or seeing) arises. On the other hand, if one does
not pay attention to or engage with an object, consciousness does
not arise, even if one is within range of the object. A person
focused on an activity is not distracted by other things. For
example, someone reading a fascinating book is only aware of the
book’s content; she may not notice loud noises or physical
discomfort. When intensely searching for something, one may not pay
attention to surrounding people and objects. People will look at an
identical object with different intentions and from different
perspectives. Take for example an empty plot of land: a child may
see it as a playground, a contractor as a building site, a farmer as
a plantation, and a manufacturer as a factory site. For each of them
the land has a different significance. Similarly, one will see an
object from different perspectives depending on one’s mood. If one
is thinking good thoughts, one notices the positive aspects of an
object, whereas bad thoughts will lead one to notice negative
aspects.</p>
<p>Imagine several objects lying together, which include a bouquet of
flowers and a knife. A person who loves flowers may only notice the
flowers, without paying attention to the knife. The stronger the
interest is for flowers, the more exclusively the person’s attention
will dwell on the flowers and the less the person will notice other
things. Other people may only notice the knife, and they will
associate the knife with different things, according to their
thoughts and aims: a thief may see it as a weapon, a cook as a
kitchen utensil, and a metal dealer as a source of income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Viññāṇa → nāma-rūpa:</em></p>
<p>Consciousness and mind &amp; body are mutually dependent in the way
described by Ven. Sāriputta:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Just as two sheaves of reeds might stand leaning against each other,
so too, with mind &amp; body as condition, consciousness comes to be; with
consciousness as condition, mind &amp; body comes to be ... If one were to
remove one of those sheaves of reeds, the other would fall, and if one
were to remove the other sheaf, the first would fall. So too, with the
cessation of mind &amp; body comes cessation of consciousness; with the
cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of mind &amp; body ...</p>
<p><em>S. II. 114.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In this sense, when there is the arising of consciousness there must
also be the arising of mind &amp; body. When volitional formations condition
consciousness, they also condition mind &amp; body. But because mind &amp; body
relies on consciousness to exist, because it is linked to and is an
attribute of consciousness, the distinction is made: volitional
formations condition consciousness, and consciousness conditions mind &amp;
body. Here, there are two important points to be mentioned on how
consciousness conditions mind &amp; body: {186}</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When cognizing an object (e.g. a visual form or a sound), a person
is in fact experiencing mind &amp; body.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn52">52</a></sup> The presently existing
object for that person is none other than the presently cognized
object, and as such it cannot be separated from mind &amp; body
experienced in that moment by consciousness. For example, when
seeing a rose, the rose that exists in that moment is the rose that
is known through the eye or is known by way of the ‘mind-door’ in
that moment of consciousness.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn53">53</a></sup> It is inseparable from the mental
concept of a ‘rose’ and from the feeling, perception and other
volitional formations present in that moment. Thus, consciousness
and mind &amp; body exist together and are mutually supportive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attributes of mind &amp; body, especially the mental factors,
correspond to the consciousness on which they depend. When a
person’s thoughts (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) are wholesome, they condition a
wholesome consciousness. In that moment the mind is bright and
consequent physical conduct is also wholesome. When a person has bad
thoughts, he or she focuses on the negative aspects of things; the
mind becomes clouded and subsequent physical conduct is strained.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Accompanying mental and physical factors act in unison with the
corresponding volitional formations and consciousness. When there is an
emotion (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) of love, a person is attentive (<em>viññāṇa</em>) to the
positive side of things; one’s mind is cheerful (<em>nāma</em>), one’s
complexion is bright, and one’s physical conduct is positive (<em>rūpa</em>).
When one is angry one focuses on the negative side of things; one’s mind
is clouded, one’s face is scowling, and one’s behaviour is stressful;
all the factors are primed to follow this negative line of thought.</p>
<p>The thoughts and intentions of an athlete at the start of a sporting
event are absorbed in that activity. His attention is commensurate to
his interest in the competition. All aspects of his mind and body
participating in this event are prepared to function accordingly.</p>
<p>The interrelationship of factors here includes the arising and ceasing
of newly formed physical and mental properties, which shape or
strengthen the personality in line with the corresponding consciousness
and volitional formations.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn54">54</a></sup> This process involving the first three
links of Dependent Origination is an important stage concerning kamma
and the fruits of kamma (<em>vipāka</em>): a small revolution of the cycle is
complete (<em>avijjā</em> = <em>kilesa</em> → <em>saṅkhāra</em> = <em>kamma</em> → <em>viññāṇa</em> &amp;
<em>nāma-rūpa</em> = <em>vipāka</em>), and begins to revolve again from the
beginning.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn55">55</a></sup> This stage is pivotal in forming habits, temperament,
understanding, skill, and personality.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Nāma-rūpa → saḷāyatana:</em></p>
<p>The factors of mind &amp; body rely on a knowledge of the external world
to function, or else they draw on stored knowledge for deciding what
course of action to take. Therefore, the aspects of mind &amp; body
acting as channels for receiving sense impressions, i.e. the
relevant sense bases, are in a state of receptivity and act in
unison with the preceding factors of Dependent Origination. {187}
For example, the sense organs (e.g. the eye and ear) of a football
player during a match are in a heightened state of alertness and are
prepared to receive relevant sense impressions. Simultaneously, the
functionality of the sense organs unassociated with this activity is
reduced and they are not in a state of alertness. While absorbed in
playing football a person’s sense of smell or taste, for example,
may be dormant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Saḷāyatana → phassa:</em></p>
<p>When the sense bases are engaged and there is the conjunction of
three things, cognition arises. The three things are: one of the six
sense bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind), one of the six
corresponding sense objects (sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile
objects, or mental objects), and one of the six corresponding kinds
of consciousness (by way of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or
mind).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Phassa → vedanā:</em></p>
<p>With the arising of contact, there is inevitably one of the three
kinds of accompanying feeling: pleasure (<em>sukha-vedanā</em>), pain
(<em>dukkha-vedanā</em>), or a neutral feeling (<em>upekkhā</em> or
<em>adukkhamasukha-vedanā</em>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The third to the seventh factors of Dependent Origination (<em>viññāṇa</em> to
<em>vedanā</em>) comprise a section called the ‘fruits of kamma’, especially
factors five, six and seven (the six sense bases, contact, and feeling).
In themselves, they are neither good nor bad, neither skilful nor
unskilful, but they act as causes for future good and bad results.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Vedanā → taṇhā:</em></p>
<p>When a person experiences a pleasant sensation, he is pleased and
delighted; he becomes attached and craves for more. When a person
experiences a painful sensation, he is annoyed; he wants the painful
object to vanish, he wants to escape from the pain, and he searches
for a pleasant substitute. When a person experiences a neutral
sensation, there tends to be apathy and complacency. Neutral
sensation is a subtle form of pleasure; it can lead to attachment
and a yearning for further pleasure.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of craving (<em>taṇhā</em>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Craving for sense pleasure (<em>kāma-taṇhā</em>): the search for
gratification by way of the five senses; desire for acquisition
(of pleasurable sense objects).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craving for existence (<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>): desire for things
associated with particular states of existence, or desire for a
state of existence (e.g. as a millionaire, a celebrity, or a
deva) bestowing such coveted things. More profoundly, it is a
desire to sustain the ‘self’ in a permanent state of existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craving for non-existence (<em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>): the desire to
escape from an undesirable object or state of existence. This
craving often manifests as coarse mental states, for example
apathy, loneliness, boredom, hopelessness, self-hatred,
self-pity, or a wish for self-annihilation (see
Note <a href="#note-three-cravings">Three Kinds of Craving</a>). {188}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Craving has these three manifestations: a desire for sensuality, a
desire for a pleasant state of existence, and a desire to escape
from the unpleasant. When a person’s desires are thwarted there is a
feeling of annoyance, aversion and ill-will. When this reaction is
expressed externally it leads to thoughts of aggression and
violence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><em>Taṇhā</em> → <em>upādāna</em>:</em> when there is desire for an object, a person
clings to it. The greater the desire the greater the attachment.
When a person experiences pain and wishes to escape the source of
that pain, attachment takes the form of hostility. At the same time,
there is a corresponding degree of attachment to things that one
believes will gratify desire: to favourable states of existence, to
a sense of self, to views, practices, and theories that satisfy
personal desires, and to customs and practices that answer to
personal needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><em>Upādāna</em> → <em>bhava</em>:</em> grasping is connected to a particular state
of existence. Attachment involves a process of binding oneself to or
identifying with a state of existence, which either provides desired
sense objects or helps to escape from undesirable objects. At the
same time, when there is a desired state of existence, there
invariably must be undesired states of existence. The state of
existence grasped on to is called <em>uppatti-bhava</em> (’passive process
of becoming’).</p>
<p>When there is attachment to a state of existence, one strives to
sustain certain aspects of this state and to escape from other
aspects. All of one’s thoughts and actions, however, are propelled
by grasping; they are influenced by established beliefs, opinions,
theories, habits, and preferences, and they manifest as behaviour
corresponding to this grasping.</p>
<p>Take for example a person who wishes to be reborn as a god: he will
attach to certain belief systems, traditions, ceremonies, and
practices that he believes will lead to heaven. He will think and
act according to these beliefs and as a consequence may even develop
idiosyncratic behaviour. A person who seeks honour will attach to a
set of values she believes to be honourable and to a corresponding
standard of behaviour. Her thoughts, actions and behaviour will
conform to his attachment. A person who covets an object belonging
to someone else attaches to the idea of ownership and attempts to
acquire the object. By not discerning the harm in wrong conduct, he
will think and act out of habit. His initial covetousness may even
lead him to steal; his wish to be an ‘owner’ results in him becoming
a ‘thief’.</p>
<p>Based on correct or false beliefs, a person responds to situations
either skilfully or immorally. {189} The specific pattern of
behaviour driven and shaped by grasping is the active process of
becoming (<em>kamma-bhava</em>). The state of existence resulting from this
behaviour, say of being a deva, an honourable person, an owner, or a
thief, is the passive process of becoming (<em>uppatti-bhava</em>). This
state of existence may conform to a person’s desires or it may
conflict with them.</p>
<p>This section of Dependent Origination is a crucial stage for the
creation of kamma, the receiving of the fruits of kamma, and for the
development of habits and personality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><em>Bhava</em> → <em>jāti</em>:</em> accurately speaking, existence in various states
of being is equivalent to the five aggregates arising, transforming,
and ceasing. The aggregates possess various properties, which
increase or decrease according to internal and external conditions.
Of all of these factors, intention is the leader, which determines
the appearance and qualities of the general flow of existence.</p>
<p>The five aggregates are in constant flux, arising and ceasing in
every moment. Conventionally speaking, one may say a ‘person’ is
born, ages, and dies in every moment, as described in the
commentaries:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>In the ultimate sense, as the aggregates are arising, declining,
and passing away, when the Blessed One says: ‘Monk, you are born,
you are aging, and you are dying in every moment’, it should be
understood here that, as regards all living beings, he has made a
reference to the aggregates.</p>
<p><em>KhA. 78.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>For unawakened beings, however, there is not simply an arising and
ceasing of the five aggregates according to a natural process. When
becoming follows on from grasping, there arises a sense of ‘self’,
the perception of an ‘I’, as existing in a particular way, either
conforming to a person’s desires or not.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn56">56</a></sup> In short, a ‘self’ is
born within that state of existence, as in the former examples of an
‘owner’, a ‘thief’, or an ‘honourable person’.</p>
<p>The birth of a ‘self’ is seen clearly in times of personal conflict
involving strong emotions, for instance in the course of arguments,
even apparently rational ones. If a person succumbs to mental
defilement rather than applies wisdom, a distinct sense of self is
generated, for example: ‘I am in charge’, ‘I am respectable’, ‘he is
unworthy’, ‘he is inferior’, ‘this is my opinion’, or ‘I am being
contradicted’. Consequently, the sense of being a certain kind of
person may be discredited or lost. The birth of a ‘self’ is
especially distinct at times of aging and death, but as is evident
from the next link in the cycle, aging and death are only possible
because of birth:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><em>Jāti</em> → <em>jarāmaraṇa</em>:</em> when there is a ‘self’ existing in a
particular way, then there is a ‘self’ that is separated from
particular states of existence, and a ‘self’ that is impeded,
agitated, diminished, and unfulfilled. With the birth of a ‘self’,
there is a wish to sustain a desired state of existence: a wish for
stability and permanence. But the birth of a self inevitably brings
the end of the self. There is a constant threat of weakness and
loss, producing a fear of disturbance, conflict, and death, and
leading a person to cling more tightly to that state of existence.
{190} A fear of death is embedded in people’s subconscious and
affects their behaviour. It leads people to grasp after desired
states of existence, to be intimidated by discomfort, and to
experience pleasure with anxiety, fearing that it will disappear.</p>
<p>When the ‘self’ is born in an undesired state of existence or when
it is born in a desired state from which it must pass away, the
various forms of suffering arise: sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief
and despair. People suffering in this way are misguided and blinded.
They vainly seek an escape using methods tainted by ignorance, thus
continuing the cycle of Dependent Origination.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>In a competitive world, an ordinary person experiences two kinds of
‘success’: there is conventional (<em>sammati</em>) success, with its
socially agreed upon definition; and there is the subjective idea of
success that is held by grasping – the act of ‘becoming’ (<em>bhava</em>).
It is often the case for people, especially those who are proud, to
have the thought: ‘I am successful’ (i.e.: ‘I am born into the state
of being a success’). This is then followed by the thought: ‘But for
success to be complete, I deserve prestige, praise, recognition and
reward.’ Success is thus linked to praise, to the failure of others,
and to a sense of fulfilled ambition. In the moment when the sense
of success arises along with its related attributes, there is a
feeling of being fulfilled or unfulfilled.</p>
<p>With fulfilment comes the feeling of having to firmly attach to
success, out of fear that the success will disappear and that the
praise and admiration will wane. When others do not express the
desired amount of praise, the person feels unhappy, since the sense
of being a ‘success’ is affected and threatened. One is threatened
by decay (<em>jarā</em>) and by the passing away (<em>maraṇa</em>) from the
cherished state of success (<em>bhava</em>) along with its attendant
benefits. In this circumstance, the feelings of disappointment,
worry, and despondency, which have not been uprooted by mindfulness
and clear comprehension, preoccupy and entangle people. They become
innate characteristics, shaping personality, affecting behaviour,
and continuing the cycle of Dependent Origination. {191}</p>
<p>The fabricated idea of ‘self’ takes up space in the heart, which
leads to a sense of confinement and limitation. This feeling of
limitation induces people to separate themselves from others and
gives rise to the ideas of ‘me’ and ‘other’. When the sense of self
becomes further inflated, a person wants to acquire, to accomplish,
and to impress others. But the sense of self must be checked and
suppressed by people themselves. If people are overly egotistical or
follow desires without restraint, external conflict arises. Such
unrestrained behaviour also leads to a loss of vitality, by
increasing the power of desire and a sense of personal inadequacy.
Overall conflict is thus augmented and contentment decreases. There
is then no satisfaction and each moment is an opportunity for stress
to arise.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Three Kinds of Craving</span><a id="note-three-cravings"></a></p>

<p>There are two or three conflicting ways of translating these three
kinds of craving, especially the second and third kinds (see, e.g.:
Vbh. 365; Vism. 567-8). Some scholars associate <em>bhava-taṇhā</em> with a
life-instinct or life-wish, and associate <em>vibhava-taṇhā</em> with a
death-instinct or death-wish, corresponding to the psychological
terminology of Sigmund Freud (see: M. O’C. Walshe, <em>Buddhism for
Today</em>, George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, © 1962, pp. 37-40). One very
clear definition for <em>bhava-taṇhā</em> and <em>vibhava-taṇhā</em> is found at It.

<h3><a class="header" href="#examples-from-everyday-life" id="examples-from-everyday-life">Examples from Everyday Life</a></h3>
<p>Tom and Ben are students and intimate friends; everyday at school they
great each other cheerfully. One day Tom sees Ben and greets him in a
friendly manner, but Ben frowns and does not reply. As a consequence Tom
gets angry and stops speaking with Ben. In this situation the process
occurs in this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ignorance: Tom does not know the reasons behind Ben’s bad mood and
he does not reflect with wisdom to work out the truth of the
situation. Ben may be upset about something or have an unresolved
problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volitional formations: Tom forms various ideas corresponding to his
personal habits and opinions. He speculates about what Ben must be
thinking or feeling, and mental defilements may make Tom feel
confused, angry or offended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consciousness: in his disturbed state, Tom notices those of Ben’s
actions that fuel and confirm his current prejudices and interprets
them accordingly. And the more he does this, the more convinced he
is that he is right. Tom finds all of Ben’s expressions and actions
annoying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mind-and-body: the various aspects of Tom’s mind and body –
feelings, thoughts, mental states, facial expressions, gestures,
etc. – manifest as symptoms of anger and conceit. The physical and
mental factors that arise match consciousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six sense bases: the sense bases involved in this situation are
alert and fully primed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact: there is contact (particularly eye contact or ear contact)
with those characteristics and traits of Ben that are particularly
pronounced or arresting, for example sullenness, unresponsiveness,
and apparent scorn and disrespect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feeling: a feeling of discomfort, stress, pain, or sadness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craving: a desire for the destruction and extinction of the
discomforting, oppressive sense impressions. {192}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grasping: Tom grasps onto the idea that Ben’s behaviour is
deliberately aimed at him and that the issue must somehow be sorted
out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becoming: Tom’s behaviour is conditioned by grasping. His behaviour
(<em>kamma-bhava</em>) is adversarial; his existence at this moment
(<em>uppatti-bhava</em>) is as an adversary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Birth: Tom embraces this existence as an adversary. He clearly sees
himself as Ben’s foe. He separates ‘me’ and ‘him’, and identifies
himself as one who must confront Ben.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aging-and-death: the ‘self’ arising in this state of conflict is
sustained by various perceptions, for example as being a person who
is able, skilled, honourable, dignified, or successful. These
qualities, however, have opposing qualities, say of inferiority,
failure, dishonour, or defeat. As soon as the desired ‘self’ arises
it is threatened by the possibility of turning into its opposite.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Tom may not be able to sustain the identity of a skilled and effective
adversary; rather he may become weak and unable to defend his honour.
Suffering continually assails him. It ranges from the fear that he will
not get what he wants, the tension and worry involved in the search for
a desired state of being, right up to the disappointment if he is
unsuccessful. And even in the case that he is successful, a waning of
enjoyment inevitably follows. This suffering envelops and overshadows
the mind, conditioning further ignorance and another turning of the
wheel.</p>
<p>This suffering is like a festering wound, which steadily releases
toxins; it causes problems for the person and for others, affects
behaviour, and shapes the entire course of life. In the above example,
Tom may be unhappy all day, be unable to concentrate on his studies, act
and speak badly towards others, and cause further conflicts.</p>
<p>If Tom were to respond correctly from the beginning, this cycle of
problems would not occur. When Ben does not smile or return his
greeting, Tom would reflect with wisdom that Ben may have encountered
some trouble; perhaps he was scolded by one of the teachers, is short of
money, or is suffering from some other unresolved issue. Thinking in
this way he will not be upset; rather, his heart will remain spacious
and full of compassion. He may inquire after the cause, comfort Ben,
help him find a solution to the problem, or simply allow Ben to have
some quiet time to himself.</p>
<p>Even if a negative cycle begins to turn there is an opportunity to make
amends. Say the cycle has reached contact (<em>phassa</em>), where Tom is aware
of Ben’s unpleasant behaviour and Tom begins to suffer as a result. Tom
can give rise to mindfulness instead of falling victim to an ensuing
craving for escape (<em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>). By considering the situation,
wisdom severs the cycle and Tom experiences Ben’s actions in a new way.
Tom uses reason to reflect on Ben’s actions and on his own appropriate
response. Tom’s mind will be clear and free from stress, and he will
think of ways to help his friend. {193}</p>
<p>The arising of wisdom brings freedom to the mind; no ‘self’ is
fabricated that is prone to disturbance. Apart from not creating
personal problems, wisdom gives rise to the compassionate wish to reduce
others’ suffering. This has the opposite effect from ignorance, which
leads to the ‘wheel of rebirth’ (<em>saṁsāra</em>), to craving and attachment,
and to a restricted sense of ‘self’, which is subject to pain and has
far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p>At this point let us review some important aspects of Dependent
Origination:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The entire process of Dependent Origination described above occurs
rapidly – it is completed in an instant. For example, a student who
has failed his exams, a person who has lost a loved one, or a person
who sees his beloved with another partner may be anguished,
frightened, or in shock; he may even scream or faint. The stronger
the attachment and importance bestowed on something, the more
intense the reaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conditional factors need not follow a set temporal sequence. In
a similar manner, a piece of chalk, a blackboard, a clean surface,
and the act of writing are all conditions for written words (on the
blackboard).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The teaching of Dependent Origination emphasizes an understanding of
a natural law – a process found in nature – for discerning the
source of problems and the specific points that require correction.
The details of that correction, the methods of practice, are not
directly connected to the teaching of Dependent Origination, but are
matters related to the ‘Path’ (<em>magga</em>) or the ‘Middle Way’
(<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn58">58</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the former examples are superficial and lack subtlety,
especially those illustrating the link between ignorance and volitional
formations, the link between craving and clinging, and the link in which
sorrow, lamentation, etc. induce a further rotation of the cycle. Some
of the examples describing ignorance are limited to specific
circumstances – they are not matters present in each moment of life.
This may lead some people to think that ordinary people can live much of
their lives without ignorance or that Dependent Origination does not
give a true account of daily life. Therefore, it is important to provide
a clearer, more detailed explanation of some of the difficult points.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#deeper-explanations" id="deeper-explanations">Deeper Explanations</a></h3>
<p>When encountering an object or a situation, people normally interpret
it, create ideas about it, and respond to it influenced by the following
four predispositions or subconscious impulses:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Kāma</em>: the desire for gratification by way of the five senses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhava</em>: the desire for or anxiety over self-existence; the desire
to be a particular way and to maintain a desired state of existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhi</em>: habitual views, beliefs, doctrines and theories that are
attached to and cherished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Avijjā</em>: delusion; ignorance; a lack of true awareness and
comprehension of causes, effects, meanings, values, and objectives,
and of the natural relationship between things or between events; a
lack of discernment of the law of causality; the mistaken view that
a ‘self’ acts and is acted upon; an understanding of things
conditioned by personal conjecture or mental fabrication. {194}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These four predispositions, especially factors three and four, are
connected. When one does not clearly understand the truth (<em>avijjā</em>),
one tends to act in accord with habitual views, beliefs, ideas and
concepts (<em>diṭṭhi</em>), many of which one assimilates from society. Factors
three and four also influence factors one and two: ignorance and
socially conditioned views determine and control people’s thoughts and
actions – what they like, what they need, and how they seek
satisfaction; they lie buried in a person’s subconscious and dictate
behaviour without the person being aware of them.</p>
<p>It is a common perception that people act entirely out of free will, but
this is a delusion. If one investigates closely and asks what people
really want, why they want these things, and why they follow a
particular course of action, one sees that there is no real freedom of
choice for most people. Their behaviour is conditioned by their
upbringing and education, by culture, by religious beliefs, and by
social conventions. They choose and act within the confines of these
social factors; even if they depart from usual (i.e. ‘normal’) forms of
behaviour, they still use these factors as a standard for comparison.</p>
<p>All the things that ordinary people identify with lie within the
framework of these four predispositions (and are part of the five
aggregates). Apart from being absent of any real ‘substance’ or ‘self’,
these things exert an unrelenting power over people, who, while under
their sway, have no independence.</p>
<p>These four predispositions are called <em>āsava</em>, often translated as
‘effluent’ or ‘outflow’ – something that leaks out; or as ‘taint’ –
something that ‘festers’ and ‘ferments’ in the heart. (See
Note <a href="#note-taints">The Four Taints</a>.) These things leak out and stain the mind when
a person encounters sense objects. Whenever a person contacts something
by way of the senses or thinks of something, these ‘āsavas’ permeate and
contaminate the mind. One’s experience of sense objects is not guided by
wisdom, but is mediated by the taints.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn59">59</a></sup> This state of affairs
prevents objective knowing and leads to continual problems. {195}</p>

<p><span class="caption">The Four Taints</span><a id="note-taints"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The four taints are known as <em>kāmāsava</em>, <em>bhavāsava</em>, diṭṭhāsava, and
avijjāsava, respectively. This group of four taints is found in the
Abhidhamma; in the suttas only three are mentioned – diṭṭhāsava does
not appear. Diṭṭhāsava is an intermediate factor between avijjāsava
and <em>bhavāsava</em>: it relies on ignorance to be established and it
expresses itself through the taint of becoming. Three <em>āsava</em>: see
e.g. D. II. 81; S. IV. 256. Four <em>āsava</em>: see e.g. Vbh. 373-4.
Alternative English translations for <em>āsava</em> are: ‘inflowing
impulses’, ‘influxes’, ‘biases’, and ‘cankers’. The four taints are
sometimes referred to as the taint of sense-gratification, the taint
of becoming (or of ‘self-centred pursuits’), the taint of views, and
the taint of ignorance, respectively. MA. I. 67 claims that
<em>diṭṭhāsava</em> is incorporated into <em>bhavāsava</em> because the desire for
existence or the attachment to jhāna, for instance, is linked to an
eternalist view or to an annihilationist view. See more material at:
Nd. II. 7; DA. III. 999; VinṬ.: Paṭhamo Bhāgo, Verañjakaṇḍavaṇṇanā.</p>

<p>These taints govern unenlightened people’s behaviour, including their
thoughts and actions, without people being aware of them. They are the
agents behind the basic mistake of viewing things as ‘me’ or ‘mine’,
which is the most fundamental level of ignorance. They are the starting
point for Dependent Origination: when there is the arising of the
taints, there is the arising of ignorance. Ignorance is then the
condition for volitional formations, by which people act with a deluded
sense of ‘self’. Similarly, one can say that people are not free because
their behaviour is ruled by unrecognized volitional impulses.</p>
<p>One definition for ignorance is a lack of discernment of the three
universal characteristics, especially the quality of nonself. A person
is unaware that the things considered to be a ‘being’, a ‘person’, a
‘self’, ‘me’, and ‘you’, etc., exist as a stream of myriad physical and
mental components that are interrelated and mutually dependent. The
continual arising and dissolution of these components causes this stream
to perpetually change shape. People exist as a collection of thoughts,
desires, habits, inclinations, opinions, values, perceptions, insights,
and beliefs (both irrational, erroneous beliefs and well-grounded,
correct beliefs). These thoughts, etc. are the result of cultural
transmission, education, and ongoing responses both to internal events
and to one’s environment.</p>
<p>When people are unaware of this fact, they identify with one or another
of these components. Through such self-identification, these things
deceive and subjugate people; they lead one to see things in the context
of a ‘self’ and to believe that one is a free agent behind action.</p>
<p>At this point, let us look at another link that is difficult to
understand: the link between craving and clinging, which is similarly a
stage involving mental impurity.</p>
<p>The three kinds of craving mentioned earlier are all expressions of a
single form of basic craving, which all unawakened people possess. This
craving is evident when one investigates the deeper workings of the
mind, beginning with its lack of understanding of the interdependent
relationship of things. This misunderstanding produces the distorted
sense of ‘self’, which in turn generates an underlying desire for
existence – the desire for this illusory ‘self’ to exist forever.</p>
<p>The desire for existence is not abstract, but is connected to the desire
for sense objects: a person desires existence in order to experience
desirable objects and to gratify sense desire. People want to ‘be’
because they want to ‘get’. The desire for sense objects amplifies the
desire for existence.</p>
<p>When the desire for existence is strong but a person does not acquire
desirable sense objects, however, the reaction is a state of existence
(<em>bhava</em>) that is unsatisfactory, objectionable, and unendurable. The
person then wants this state of existence to end. But as soon as there
is a desire for extinction the desire for acquisition resurfaces, since
there is the fear that with extinction one may not experience desired
pleasure; the desire for existence thus follows in its wake. {196}</p>
<p>The same process occurs when one acquires an object of desire but not to
a satisfactory degree, or when one acquires an object but one starts to
desire something else. The most basic and all-encompassing desire is the
desire for more. One finds that human beings are perpetually searching
for a happiness that surpasses the happiness they are currently
experiencing. Unawakened beings constantly miss or forsake the present
moment. People find the present moment hard to endure; they want to
escape from it and seek a more gratifying state of existence. The desire
to get, the desire to be, and the desire to cease existing, thus
continually spin around in a vortex within the lives of ordinary people.
Because this cycle is subtle and occurs in every moment, people are not
aware that they are constantly struggling to escape from the previous
moment and to seek gratification from each subsequent moment.</p>
<p>Craving stems from ignorance: because people do not understand the
interdependent nature of things, there occurs a fundamental error. They
see things either as substantial, as possessing a stable and permanent
core or self,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn60">60</a></sup> or see things as existing for a period of time in a
stable, substantial way and then dissolving.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn61">61</a></sup></p>
<p>All unawakened people hold these two views in subtle degrees, and hence
are subject to the three kinds of craving. Because of the deluded and
deep-seated view that things possess a permanent, solid ‘self’, there
arises the craving for existence. And because of ignorance and doubt,
there arises the competing view that things possess a solid substance,
but that this substance or ‘self’ perishes and disappears. Consequently,
there arises the craving for extinction.</p>
<p>These two wrong views give the opportunity for craving to arise. If a
person understands the fluid, interdependent nature of things, there can
be no permanent, solid ‘self’, nor can there be a real, objective ‘self’
that dissolves and disappears. Neither craving for being nor craving for
extinction has any foundation to stand on. Craving for sense pleasure
also results from these two wrong views: fearing that the ‘self’ or the
pleasure may disappear, people anxiously search for personal
gratification. And because they see things as permanent and solid, they
grab onto things in order to reinforce a sense of stability.</p>
<p>On a coarse level, craving manifests as the search for sensual pleasure
and for situations providing such pleasure, or as boredom with pleasures
already acquired. People who have no inner independence feel tedium and
agitation when they are unable to experience gratifying sense objects.
They constantly search around for new forms of pleasure to escape their
disquiet and discomfort. When they do not get what they want they feel
disappointment, discouragement, and self-loathing. Their happiness and
unhappiness are entirely dependent on external conditions. Time without
stimulation or activity then becomes a punishment or a misfortune. {197}</p>
<p>Boredom, depression, loneliness, and discontentment increase both for
the individual and in society, even though there is an increase of
stimulating objects, and the search for stimulation becomes more crude
and passionate. A deeper inspection reveals that problems like drug
abuse and teenage delinquency stem from a lack of patience, boredom, and
the wish to escape from the state of existence one is born into in that
moment.</p>
<p>The mental impurity resulting from craving is grasping (<em>upādāna</em>), of
which there are four kinds:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Kāmupādāna</em>: grasping onto sensuality;<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn62">62</a></sup> as a consequence of
craving, the mind firmly attaches to desired objects. When one
acquires a desired object, one attaches to it because one wishes for
further gratification and because one fears separation. Attachment
arises when a person experiences a moment of gratification and then
wishes to repeat the experience, or else when desired objects do not
provide gratification. Loss or disappointment may then lead to
greater fixation and longing. Although objects of desire do not
truly belong to people, they try to persuade themselves that in some
way they do possess them. The minds of ordinary people are therefore
constantly tangled up with desirable objects and it is difficult for
them to reach objectivity, security, and freedom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Diṭṭhupādāna</em>: grasping onto views; the desire for something to
exist or to be eradicated produces biased views and beliefs, which
correspond to people’s desires. The search for gratification leads
people to grasp onto teachings, theories, philosophical doctrines,
etc. that serve and minister to their desire. When people attach to
a view, then they appropriate it and identify with it. Apart from
thinking and acting in accord with such a view, they feel personally
threatened whenever they encounter an opposing view. They feel this
opposing view may diminish, weaken, or destroy their ‘self’ in some
way, and they therefore feel the need to defend their cherished view
in order to maintain dignity. This reaction produces conflict,
narrow-mindedness, and obstructed wisdom. They are unable to truly
benefit from new ideas and teachings, and they are unable to advance
their knowledge in an optimal way.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn63">63</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Sīlabbatupādāna</em>: grasping onto moral precepts and religious
practices. The desire for acquisition and existence, the ungrounded
fear of the dissolution of the self, and the attachment to views and
doctrines all lead to correspondingly superstitious behaviour in the
face of those things considered sacred and promising fulfilment,
even when people cannot rationally understand the link between these
things and desired results. {198}</p>
<p>The firm belief in a self manifests externally as an unyielding
attachment to behaviour, rules, practices, customs, traditions,
religious ceremonies, and established institutions, without an
awareness of their meaning, objectives and value. As a consequence,
human beings create such rules, customs, etc. to limit and confine
themselves. They end up becoming narrow-minded and obstinate, and
they find it difficult to improve themselves and truly take
advantage of what they experience.</p>
<p>The following passage from the late Ven. Buddhadāsa Bhikkhu<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn64">64</a></sup> may
clarify this attachment to rules and practices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>When a person upholds a moral precept or follows a teaching
without applying reasoned awareness, he simply assumes that this
action possesses some kind of sacred power, which will naturally
produce positive results. Such a person acts merely by following
forms, customs, conventions, and scriptures passed down by
society, without understanding their true meaning. Because he
repeats these actions until they become a habit, attachment
becomes more pronounced. This form of grasping varies from the
second form, which is a grasping onto mistaken views and opinions.
This third form is very hard to rectify – it is a grasping onto
spiritual practices and their external manifestations.</em></p>
<p><em>Ven. Buddhadāsa (Ariyanandamunī); ‘The Teachings of Buddhism’;<br />
Suvijānna Press, 1955; p. 60.</em> Suvijānna Press, 1955; p. 60.&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attavādupādāna</em>: grasping onto the concept of self. The mistaken
belief in a true, substantial self is native to the unawakened mind.
This belief is reinforced by linguistic conventions, which lead
people to see things as distinct, solid entities. This belief in
self, however, becomes a form of grasping when craving acts as a
condition: with a desire for acquisition a person attaches to the
idea of a self which will experience or own the desired object; with
a desire for a state of existence there is grasping onto a ‘self’
that dwells in that state; with a desire for non-existence there is
grasping onto a ‘self’ that perishes. And fear of extinction leads a
person to struggle to consolidate the sense of self.</p>
<p>These forms of desire are linked to the idea of possession or
control: people believe that there is a ‘self’ manipulating events
in accord with desire. And because events occasionally do occur in
accord with desire, they believe that they have mastery over things.
But such control is limited and temporary. The various factors
attached to as comprising the ‘self’ are merely isolated conditions
in a larger causal process. Indeed, there is no factor in this
process that can be truly or permanently controlled. People,
however, interpret even this experience of partial control as proof
of a permanent ‘self’.</p>
<p>When people grasp onto the idea of self they are unable to deal with
things in harmony with conditional factors. Instead, they are
deluded into trying to make things comply with their desires. If
people do not act in line with causality and things do not proceed
as wished, then they feel oppressed by inadequacy and loss. The
grasping onto an idea of self is central and acts as a basis for all
other forms of grasping. {199}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These four forms of grasping are connected: an encounter with a
pleasurable object gives rise to craving and covetousness. This is
followed by grasping onto sensuality: people attach to the desired
object, thinking they must acquire, experience, or possess it. Grasping
onto views then follows: they think, ‘This is good’, ‘This will provide
happiness’, ‘Life will be meaningful when I get this object’ or, ‘Any
teaching that promotes the acquisition of this object must be correct’.
Similarly, there arises the grasping onto rules and practices: people
consequently uphold rules, traditions, moral codes, etc. as a means to
acquire the desired object. Furthermore, there arises the grasping onto
a ‘self’, as that which experiences or controls the object.</p>
<p>Clinging prevents mental freedom and clarity. People subject to clinging
are unable to think reasonably, interpret events accurately, make wise
decisions, or act responsibly in relation to the law of cause and
effect. Instead, they experience continual prejudice, limitation,
conflict and stress because they hold firmly to such ideas as ‘me’ and
‘mine’.</p>
<p>Clinging to such ideas demands that things accord with desire, even
though things must exist in line with causes and conditions and are not
subject to a person’s will. Whenever things deviate from a desired
outcome, people feel oppressed. When a cherished object is adversely
affected by something, those who grasp onto it are similarly affected.
The degree of impact or disturbance is proportional to the degree of
attachment and identification. Suffering is not the sole consequence of
this attachment: a person’s entire life and scope of activity is ruled
by desire and grasping, rather than by wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn65">65</a></sup></p>
<p>Following on from grasping, the Dependent Origination sequence proceeds
to becoming, birth, aging-and-death, and sorrow, lamentation, etc., as
described earlier. When people experience sorrow, etc. they seek to
escape. Their thoughts, choices, and actions, rather than being based on
a discernment of the truth of things, are based on accumulated habits,
prejudices, perceptions and opinions. The cycle thus resumes at
ignorance and rotates further.</p>
<p>Although ignorance is a fundamental defilement of the mind and engenders
other mental impurities, craving tends to be the catalyst and plays the
more dominant role in external behaviour. For this reason, in teachings
such as the Four Noble Truths, the source of suffering is defined as
craving (taṇhā).</p>
<p>When ignorance is unchecked – when the mind is in a state of blindness
and confusion – then craving is unconstrained and people’s intentional
actions (kamma) are more likely to be bad than good. But if people
receive spiritual training and develop confidence in a correct path,
craving can be used to their advantage. When ignorance is corrected by
wholesome beliefs, right thoughts, and reasoned understanding, then
craving is ‘deflected’ to a virtuous goal; it is disciplined and
purposeful, and can lead to wholesome actions and beneficial results.
{200}</p>
<p>With proper encouragement, craving may be a support for efforts to
eliminate ignorance and craving. In such cases a person strives to be a
good person, makes good use of idle time, applies effort to achieve
longterm goals, and tries to gain social standing or go to heaven. A
good person and a bad person are both subject to suffering, but only the
method of transforming ignorance and overcoming craving leads to freedom
and true happiness.</p>
<p>The following passage demonstrates how craving can be used to a person’s
advantage for the highest goal:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Sister, a monk hears it said: ‘They say that a monk of such and such a
name, by the destruction of the taints, in this very life enters and
dwells in the taintless liberation of mind and liberation by
wisdom’.... Then he thinks: ‘Oh, when shall I too realize the
taintless liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom?’ Then, some
time later, based on that craving, he abandons craving. It is on
account of this that it was said: ‘This body has come into being
through craving; yet based on craving, craving can be abandoned.’</p>
<p><em>A. II. 145-6.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>If there is no alternative but to choose between two forms of craving,
one should choose a craving that leads to the good and acts as an
impetus for constructive action. But if possible, one should refrain
from both advantageous and destructive craving, and choose the way of
wisdom, which is pure, unfettered, and free from suffering. {201}</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#dependent-origination-and-the-middle-teaching" id="dependent-origination-and-the-middle-teaching">Dependent Origination and the Middle Teaching</a></h2>
<p>An understanding of Dependent Origination is considered equivalent to
right view (sammā-diṭṭhi), which is objective and unbiased. The teaching
of Dependent Origination is an ‘impartial teaching of truth’ or a
‘middle teaching’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn66">66</a></sup> This teaching is differentiated from doctrines
and views that are considered ‘extreme’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn67">67</a></sup> Following are some of

<blockquote>
<p>This world, Kaccāna, for the most part depends on a duality: on the
notion of existence and the notion of nonexistence. But for one who
sees the origin of the world as it really is with correct wisdom,
there is no notion of nonexistence in regard to the world. And for one
who sees the cessation of the world as it really is with correct
wisdom, there is no notion of existence in regard to the world. This
world for the most part grasps after theories and is imprisoned by
dogmas. But the noble disciple does not become engaged with, hold, and
cling to an adherence to theories, beliefs, dogmas, and the underlying
bias of ‘my self’. He has no perplexity or doubt that what arises is
only suffering arising, what ceases is only suffering ceasing. A noble
disciple’s knowledge about this is independent of others. It is in
this way that there is right view.</p>
<p>‘All exists.’: Kaccāna, this is one extreme. ‘All does not exist’:
this is the second extreme. Without veering towards either of these
extremes, the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma by the middle: ‘With
ignorance as condition, volitional formations come to be; with
volitional formations as condition, consciousness.... But with the
remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation
of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations,
cessation of consciousness ...</p>

<p>A proper investigation of duality #3 and duality #4 (below) helps to
prevent misunderstandings concerning the law of kamma. Here are several
sutta passages in which the Buddha addresses this subject:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The naked ascetic Kassapa: ‘How is it, Master Gotama: is suffering
created by oneself?’</p>
<p>The Buddha: ‘Not so, Kassapa.’</p>
<p>‘Then is suffering created by another?’</p>
<p>‘Not so, Kassapa.’</p>
<p>‘Then is suffering created both by oneself and by another?’</p>
<p>‘Not so, Kassapa.’</p>
<p>‘Then has suffering arisen randomly,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn70">70</a></sup> being created neither by

<p>‘Not so, Kassapa.’</p>
<p>‘Then is there no suffering?’</p>
<p>‘It is not that there is no suffering; there is suffering.’</p>
<p>‘Then is it that Master Gotama does not know and see suffering?’</p>
<p>‘It is not that I do not know and see suffering, Kassapa. I know
suffering, I see suffering.’</p>
<p>‘... Venerable sir, let the Blessed One explain suffering to me. Let
the Blessed One teach me about suffering.’</p>
<p>‘Kassapa, if one asserts as in the first statement, “Suffering is
created by oneself”, this is the same as saying, “The one who acts is
the same as the one who experiences [suffering].” When one asserts
thus, this amounts to eternalism. If one asserts like someone stricken
by a feeling, “Suffering is created by another”,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn71">71</a></sup> this is the same
as saying, “The one who acts is one, the one who experiences
[suffering] is another.” When one asserts thus, this amounts to
annihilationism. Without veering towards either of these extremes, the
Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma by the middle: ‘With ignorance as
condition, volitional formations come to be.... With the remainderless
fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation ...’ {203}</p>
<p><em>S. II. 19-21.</em></p>
<p>‘Are pleasure and pain created by oneself?’</p>
<p>‘Not so.’</p>
<p>‘Are pleasure and pain created by another?’</p>
<p>‘Not so.’</p>
<p>‘Are pleasure and pain created both by oneself and by another?’</p>
<p>‘Not so.’</p>
<p>‘Then have pleasure and pain arisen randomly, being created neither by
oneself nor by another?’</p>
<p>‘Not so.’</p>
<p>‘Then is there no pleasure and pain?’</p>
<p>‘It is not that there is no pleasure and pain; there is pleasure and
pain.’</p>
<p>‘Then is it that Master Gotama does not know and see pleasure and

<p>‘It is not that I do not know and see pleasure and pain. I know
pleasure and pain, I see pleasure and pain.’</p>
<p>‘... Venerable sir, let the Blessed One explain pleasure and pain to
me. Let the Blessed One teach me about pleasure and pain.’</p>
<p>‘If one thinks as in the first statement, “The feeling and the one who
feels it are the same”, there arises the belief: “Pleasure and pain
are created by oneself.” I do not speak thus. If one thinks, “The
feeling is one, the one who feels it is another”, there arises the
belief like one who is stricken by feeling: “Pleasure and pain are
created by another.” I do not speak thus. Without veering towards
either of these extremes, the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma by the
middle: ‘With ignorance as condition, volitional formations come to

<p><em>S. II. 22-3.</em></p>
<p>I have said, Ānanda, that pleasure and pain are dependently arisen.
Dependent on what? Dependent on contact....</p>
<p>When there is the body, because of bodily volition, pleasure and pain
arise internally; when there is speech, because of verbal volition,
pleasure and pain arise internally; when there is the mind, because of
mental volition, pleasure and pain arise internally.</p>
<p>With ignorance as condition, one generates on one’s own initiative
that bodily volitional formation that conditions internal pleasure and
pain; or prompted by others one generates that bodily volitional
formation that conditions internal pleasure and pain. Either
deliberately one generates that bodily volitional formation that

“Aging-and-death is one thing, the one for whom there is this
aging-and-death is another”, or “The life principle and the body are
the same”, or “The life principle is one thing, the body is another”
– all these are abandoned, eradicated, destroyed, obliterated so that
they are no more subject to future arising.’</p>
<p><em>S. II. 60-63.</em></p>
<p>‘Venerable sir, who makes contact?’</p>
<p>‘Not a valid question’, the Blessed One replied. ‘I do not say, “One
makes contact.” If I should say, “One makes contact”, in that case
this would be a valid question: “Who makes contact?” But I do not
speak thus. Since I do not speak thus, if one should ask me, “With
what as condition does contact come to be?” this would be a valid
question. To this the valid answer is: “With the six sense bases as
condition, contact comes to be; with contact as condition feeling
comes to be.” ‘</p>
<p>‘Who feels.... Who craves.... Who grasps?’</p>
<p>‘Not a valid question.... If one should ask me, “With what as
condition does feeling come to be?” ... “With what as condition does
craving come to be?” ... “With what as condition does grasping come to
be?” this would be a valid question. To this the valid answer is:
“With contact as condition, feeling comes to be; with feeling as
condition craving comes to be....” ‘ {205}</p>
<p><em>S. II. 13-14.</em></p>
<p>‘Bhikkhus, this body is not yours, nor does it belong to others. It is
to be seen as old kamma produced by conditioning factors and generated
by volition, as the foundation for feeling. Therein, bhikkhus, the
instructed noble disciple investigates carefully Dependent Origination
thus: “When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this,
that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with
the cessation of this, that ceases. That is, with ignorance as
condition, volitional formations come to be; with volitional
formations, consciousness comes to be ... With the remainderless
fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional
formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of
consciousness ...”</p>
<p><em>S. II. 64-5.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The teaching of Dependent Origination reveals the natural law that all
conditioned things are marked by the three characteristics
(impermanence, <em>dukkha</em>, and nonself) and exist subject to causality.
Buddha-Dhamma does not concern itself with such questions as: Do things
exist absolutely? Do things lack a real existence? Do things exist in a
state of permanence? Or do things exist in a substantial way temporarily
and then disappear?</p>
<p>Those people who do not correctly understand Dependent Origination tend
to misunderstand the teaching of the Three Characteristics, especially
the quality of nonself. Having only a superficial understanding of
nonself, they interpret this quality to mean nothing exists and thus
adhere to nihilism, which is a serious wrong view.</p>
<p>A person who understands Dependent Origination correctly will escape the
misunderstandings stemming from the theories and beliefs mentioned
above, for example the belief in a first cause or a belief in the
supernatural. The Buddha addresses this topic in the following passage:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>When, bhikkhus, a noble disciple has clearly seen with correct wisdom
as it really is this Dependent Origination and these dependently
arisen phenomena, it is impossible that he will run back into the
past, thinking: ‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past?
What was I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what
did I become in the past?’ Or that he will run forward into the
future, thinking: ‘Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the
future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future?
Having been what, what will I become in the future?’ Or that he will
now be inwardly confused about the present thus: ‘Do I exist? Do I not
exist? What am I? How am I? This being – where has it come from, and
where will it go?</p>
<p>For what reason [is this impossible]? Because the noble disciple has
clearly seen with correct wisdom as it really is this Dependent
Origination and these dependently arisen phenomena.</p>
<p><em>S. II. 26-7.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>A person who understands Dependent Origination is not confused by the
metaphysical dilemmas known as the ‘unanswerable questions’
(<em>abyākata-pañhā</em>). When people asked these questions, the Buddha would
remain silent. He said that he would not explain them because when a
person sees the interdependent nature of things these questions are
considered trivial and worthless. These dilemmas are also known as the
ten ‘erroneous, extremist views’ (<em>antagāhika-diṭṭhi</em>), as illustrated
below: {206}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>‘What, Master Gotama, is the cause and reason why, when wanderers of
other sects are asked such questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is the world eternal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the world not eternal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the world finite?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the world infinite?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are the life principle and the body the same?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the life principle one thing, the body another?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does a being<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn73">73</a></sup> exist after death?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does a being not exist after death?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does a being both exist and not exist after death?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does a being neither exist nor not exist after death?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>... they give such answers as: “The world is eternal”, “The world is

<p>‘Vaccha, wanderers of other sects regard form as self, or self as
possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. They regard
feeling as self ... perception as self ... volitional formations as
self ... consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness,
or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. Therefore,
when the wanderers of other sects are asked such questions, they give
such answers as: “The world is eternal ...” But the Tathāgata, the
Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, does not regard form as self
... or self as in consciousness. Therefore, when the Tathāgata is
asked such questions, he does not give such answers.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn74">74</a></sup> {207}</p>

</div>
<p>There are other erroneous doctrines and theories concerning kamma that
conflict with the teaching of Dependent Origination, but these will be
discussed in the separate chapter on kamma.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn75">75</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#dependent-origination-in-a-social-context" id="dependent-origination-in-a-social-context">Dependent Origination in a Social Context</a></h2>
<p>So far the discussion has focused only on Dependent Origination as it
occurs in the minds and lives of individual people. In the Mahānidāna
Sutta,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn76">76</a></sup> however, which is a very important teaching and is the
longest of all suttas describing Dependent Origination, the Buddha
explained conditionality both in a person’s mind and between people or
in society. Following is a brief explanation of how Dependent
Origination works on a social level:</p>
<p>The origination of suffering, or the origination of evil, in society
proceeds in the same fashion as the origination of suffering in an
individual, but the manifestation of social ills begins with craving. In
the following passage the Buddha highlights this link in the chain of
Dependent Origination:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>And so, Ānanda, feeling conditions craving, craving conditions seeking
(pariyesanā), seeking conditions acquisition (lābha), acquisition
conditions appraisal (vinicchaya), appraisal conditions passionate
attachment (chanda-rāga), passionate attachment conditions
preoccupation (ajjhosāna), preoccupation conditions possessiveness
(pariggaha), possessiveness conditions stinginess (macchariya),
stinginess conditions protectiveness (ārakkha), and dependent on
protectiveness, as a consequence of protectiveness, there arise the
taking up of stick and sword, quarrels, disputes, arguments, strife,
abuse, lying and other evil unskilful states.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn77">77</a></sup> {208}</p>
<p><em>D. II. 58-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The Mahānidāna Sutta thus introduces an alternative sequence of
Dependent Origination, containing factors different from those
manifesting in an individual. The factors shared by both formats are
illustrated thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Ignorance → volitional formations → consciousness → mind &amp; body → six
sense bases → contact → feeling → craving.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within an individual, when craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) arises, the process
continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Craving → grasping → becoming → birth → aging-and-death, sorrow,
lamentation, etc. = individual suffering.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In society, however, craving leads to these alternative factors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Craving → seeking → acquisition → appraisal → passionate attachment →
preoccupation → possessiveness → stinginess → protectiveness→
quarrels, disputes, arguments, strife, etc. = social problems. {209}</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kalahavivāda Sutta contains similar material but it is in the form
of questions and answers and is composed in verse, so differs in some of
the details.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn78">78</a></sup></p>
<p>To help explain Dependent Origination as it relates to social conditions
one can examine associated processes that are mentioned elsewhere in the
scriptures, for example the process of differentiation (<em>nānatta</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The existence of various elements (<em>dhātu-nānatta</em>) → the various
forms of contact (<em>phassa-nānatta</em>) → the various kinds of feeling
(<em>vedanā-nānatta</em>) → various perceptions (<em>saññā-nānatta</em>) → various
thoughts (<em>saṅkappa-nānatta</em>) → various desires (<em>chanda-nānatta</em>) →
various passions (<em>pariḷāha-nānatta</em>) → various forms of seeking
(<em>pariyesanā-nānatta</em>) → various forms of acquisition
(<em>lābha-nānatta</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn79">79</a></sup></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first section of the above passage, from the elements to perception,
can be summarized as ‘various elements generate various perceptions’.
Another passage in the Canon therefore presents this outline as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Various elements → various perceptions → various thoughts → various
desires → various passions → various forms of seeking → various forms
of acquisition.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn80">80</a></sup></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These alternative presentations of Dependent Origination combine
internal human dynamics with external social affairs. They present a
wide perspective, revealing the source of social problems to be people’s
mental defilements. It may be said that those suttas explaining the
wider implications of mental defilement, for example the Aggañña
Sutta,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn81">81</a></sup> the Cakkavatti Sutta,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn82">82</a></sup> and the Vāseṭṭha Sutta,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn83">83</a></sup> are
working models of Dependent Origination in a social context. {210}</p>
<p>There are a couple of important points to keep in mind when examining
this form of presentation: the law of conditionality implies a
dependency and necessity between factors. In the phrase ‘feeling
conditions craving’, the arising of craving depends on feeling; feeling
is required for craving to arise. However, when feeling exists, it does
not necessarily lead to craving. It is at this link between feeling and
craving that the cycle of Dependent Origination can be severed, as
corroborated by the sutta passages mentioned earlier, which describe the
arising of feeling without subsequent craving. When a person experiences
feeling with adequate mindfulness and clear comprehension, the link is
cut and craving does not arise.</p>
<p>Note from the Mahānidāna Sutta that the Buddha began his analysis of
social woes at this juncture, where feeling conditions craving (<em>vedanaṃ
paṭicca taṇhā</em>). This link between feeling and craving is a crucial
stage and has a direct bearing on human behaviour and social wellbeing.</p>
<p>The suttas cited above describe how aspects of human society, like the
caste system and differences in individual circumstances, result from
human interactions and are influenced by the natural environment. Social
conditions are shaped by the interdependency between human beings
(beginning with people’s mental qualities), society, and the natural
environment. For example, a person’s feelings rely on contact, which is
affected by social and environmental factors as well as internal factors
like perception. When craving follows feeling, subsequent behaviour may
have an impact on other people and on the environment so that all
factors are affected. Human beings are not the only factor influencing
society and the environment, neither are society or the environment the
only factor in influencing the other two: the three are interdependent.</p>
<p>Sections of the Aggañña Sutta illustrate the process of conditionality:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Idle individuals hoard grain and this practice becomes popular</em></p>
<p>→ areas are established for allocating grain</p>
<p>→ greedy individuals steal grain from others to increase their share</p>
<p>→ there arises censure, deceit, punishment, and fighting</p>
<p>→ wise individuals see the need for government; there develops the
practice of electing a leader or king (<em>khattiya</em>); some people become
disillusioned with the corruption in society and go to live in the
forest to free themselves from evil and develop jhāna; some of these
people live near populated areas; they study and compose texts, and
the term ‘brahman’ (<em>brāhmaṇa</em>) is coined; those people who have
families and pursue various forms of enterprise are called ‘merchants’
(<em>vessa</em>); others whose behaviour is considered vulgar or inferior are
branded as ‘low class’ (<em>sudda</em>)</p>
<p>→ members of each of these four groups abandon their personal customs,
renounce the household life, and go forth as ascetics (<em>samaṇa</em>).
{211}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sutta shows that various castes and social classes are formed and
conditioned by naturally occurring human relationships; they are not
created by a creator God. Every person has the choice to perform good or
bad deeds and everyone will equally receive the fruits of their actions
in accord with natural laws. And every person who cultivates the Dhamma
correctly can reach liberation – can reach Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The Cakkavatti Sutta (mentioned above) describes the conditions
underlying crime and other social ills:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Government leaders do not provide financial assistance to the poor</em></p>
<p>→ poverty is rampant</p>
<p>→ theft is rampant</p>
<p>→ the use of weapons is rampant</p>
<p>→ killing is rampant</p>
<p>→ the spread of lying, divisive speech, harsh and frivolous speech,
sexual misconduct, covetousness, hostility, wrong views, attachment to
unrighteousness (<em>adhamma-rāga</em>), greed, injustice (<em>micchā-dhamma</em>),
lack of respect for parents, ascetics and brahmans, and lack of
respect according to social standing</p>
<p>→ the decline of beauty and longevity.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#the-link-between-the-middle-teaching-and-the-middle-way" id="the-link-between-the-middle-teaching-and-the-middle-way">The Link Between the Middle Teaching and the Middle Way</a></h2>
<p>(Trans.: in the Thai edition of <em>Buddhadhamma</em>, this section is at the
beginning of chapter 12, introducing the Middle Way.)</p>
<p>The Middle Teaching (majjhena-dhammadesanā) is the objective truth
revealed by the Buddha – the truth that all things naturally accord
with causes and conditions and that they are not subject to the extreme
or biased views fabricated by people to match their erroneous
perceptions and their desires for the world to be a certain way. The
Middle Teaching refers to Dependent Origination: the process of the
interdependent arising of things. As outlined earlier, there are two
formats or courses of Dependent Origination in reference to the
suffering of human beings. The first format illustrates the arising of
suffering. The second format illustrates the cessation of suffering.</p>
<p>The Middle Teaching describes these two processes:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn84">84</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Origination (<em>samudaya</em>): the origination cycle of dependent
origination: <em>avijjā</em> → <em>saṅkhāra</em> → <em>viññāṇa</em> → ... <em>jāti</em> →
<em>jarāmaraṇa →</em> <em>soka-parideva-dukkha-domanassa-upāyāsā</em> = the origin
of suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cessation (<em>nirodha</em>): the cessation cycle of dependent origination:
ignorance ceases → volitional formations cease → consciousness
ceases → ... birth ceases → aging and death cease → sorrow,
lamentation, pain, grief and despair cease = the cessation of
suffering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Suffering is of primary concern to human beings. The origination cycle
is presented to identify the source of suffering, and the first step is
to outline the factors acting as a foundation for suffering.</p>
<p>As for the cessation cycle, the term <em>nirodha</em> in the Middle Teaching
has a broad range of meaning. Besides referring to the process leading
to the cessation of suffering, it also refers to Nibbāna – freedom from
suffering. The Middle Teaching incorporates both the cessation cycle and
Nibbāna. {514}</p>
<p>By describing the teachings on suffering, the cause of suffering, the
cessation cycle, and the freedom from suffering, one may conclude that
the entire essence of Buddha-Dhamma has been captured, but this is not
the case. The reason for this is that the Middle Teaching purely
describes naturally occurring phenomena; it does not include the means
of spiritual practice applied by human beings.</p>
<p>The cessation cycle as found in the Middle Teaching is depicted as a
pure (i.e. ‘theoretical’ or ‘mechanical’) process of nature. It
describes the necessary interrelated causes and conditions that lead to
the end of suffering, but it does not explain the details of practical
application: it does not specify what needs to be done in practical
terms to reach this end.</p>
<p>People may study the Middle Teaching and gain a gradual understanding of
the cessation cycle and the principle of ending suffering, but they
still require practical advice to achieve results conforming to this
principle. Our responsibility in regard to nature is to gain knowledge
(initially an intellectual grasp of natural truths) and then to apply
this knowledge to spiritual practice. This is the link between
objective, natural processes and Dhamma practice.</p>
<p>The Pali term for Dhamma practice, including methods of practice, is
<em>paṭipadā</em>. This term specifically refers to rules of practice, methods
of practice, or ways of conducting one’s life in order to reach the end
of suffering. The Buddha set down this practice in conformity with the
Middle Teaching on the cessation of suffering, and he called this
practice the ‘middle way of practice’ (<em>majjhimā-paṭipadā</em>) or simply
the ‘Middle Way’. It is a balanced practice corresponding with the laws
of nature, and it gives results according to the natural cycle of
cessation. It is impartial; it does not swing to either of the two
extremes that cause entanglement or deviation from the correct
path.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn85">85</a></sup></p>
<p>The Middle Way can be simply referred to as the ‘Path’. The Path is
comprised of eight factors and because it leads to awakening (i.e. the
state of a ‘noble person’) it is called the ‘Noble Eightfold Path’
(<em>ariya-aṭṭhaṅgika-magga</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn86">86</a></sup> The Buddha said that this is an ancient
Path, which has been traversed by the Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the
past. The Buddha rediscovered this path and revealed it to others,
showing the way to those who are ready to be trained.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn87">87</a></sup> {515}</p>
<p>This path of practice produces results in accord with the cessation
cycle; it enables causes and conditions to proceed in an interconnected
way until the natural process reaches its end. The achievement of the
Path marks the transition from the theoretical cycle of cessation, or
from a preliminary knowledge of truth, to practical application.</p>
<p>The transition from the theoretical cycle of cessation to practical
application can be illustrated in this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cessation (<em>nirodha</em>): cessation of ignorance → cessation of
volitional formations → cessation of consciousness ... → cessation of
birth → cessation of aging-and-death, sorrow ... despair = cessation
of suffering.</em></p>
<p>Path (<em>magga</em>): right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>) + right intention
(<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>) + right speech (<em>sammā-vācā</em>) + right action
(<em>sammā-kammanta</em>) + right livelihood (<em>sammā-ājīva</em>) + right effort
(<em>sammā-vāyāma</em>) + right mindfulness (<em>sammā-sati</em>) + right
concentration (<em>sammā-samādhi</em>) → cessation of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some significant points concerning the connection between the
cessation cycle and the practice of the Path:</p>
<p>The cessation cycle is a process occurring in nature; the Path is a way
of practice for human beings to achieve results in accord with this
natural process. The Path arises from applying knowledge of the
cessation cycle. This knowledge is developed into a method of practice
and one who follows this practice must have at least a rudimentary
understanding of the cessation cycle. For this reason, the Path begins
with ‘right view’.</p>
<p>The cessation cycle deals directly with the relationship between causes
and conditions; it is described as the cessation of causes and
conditions that give rise to suffering. Cessation in this context is
decisive and complete: it is an end to and a freedom from all problems.
The Path of practice, on the other hand, is flexible. The details of
practice can be described in terms of different degrees of difficulty,
and the eight factors of the Path can be expanded upon into various
levels of complexity. The path to liberation is gradual, and the
reduction or elimination of problems is commensurate with the extent or
degree of a person’s practice.</p>
<p>The cessation cycle focuses explicitly on causes and conditions – it is
impersonal, and it points to the utter elimination of such causes and
conditions. It includes little mention of good and bad or good and evil.
The Path is gradual; it constitutes an increase in the power of goodness
to combat and vanquish negative, obstructive forces. It emphasizes the
abandonment of the bad and the cultivation of the good at many levels.
{516}</p>
<p>The cessation cycle is theoretical; the Path is practical and
methodical.</p>
<p>To use an analogy, the cessation cycle is like the set of principles
involved in extinguishing a fire: fuel must be removed, the oxygen
supply cut off, and the temperature reduced. The Path is similar to the
methods used to achieve results based on these principles: what is
needed to remove the fuel, cut off oxygen, and reduce temperature. This
requires much effort, both in acquiring the necessary equipment and
planning tactics: should water or an alternative fire retardant be used?
What tools are needed? How should one respond in the case of ordinary
fires, electrical fires, oil fires, and gas fires? How does one access
the fire and protect oneself? And how does one train people to act as
firefighters?</p>
<p>Similarly, the cessation cycle is like the set of principles involved in
treating disease, which refers directly to the removal of pathological
elements: the elimination of germs, the removal of toxins and foreign
substances, the repair of faulty or weakened tissues and organs, the
supply of deficient nutrients, and the improvement of one’s mental
condition. The Path is like the treatment of disease, which may only
involve a brief review of medical principles and yet comprise elaborate
and complex procedures, including: examination, diagnosis, medication,
surgery, nursing, physiotherapy, the manufacture and use of medical
equipment, the creation of clinics and hospitals, health administration,
and the training of medical staff.</p>
<p>The eight fundamental factors of the Path can be expanded on and
rearranged into many formats, groups and stages, to correspond with
various objectives, persons, circumstances, conditions, and levels of
readiness, all of which requires detailed study. The Middle Way is
therefore explained in a separate section of <em>Buddhadhamma</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn88">88</a></sup> This
explanation can be divided into two parts: first is a description of the
eight factors, which is a basic, preliminary structure; and second is an
expansion and rearrangement of these factors into new outlines,
according to specific circumstances.</p>
<p>At this point let us look again at the transition from the theoretical
description of phenomena to the way of practice, a transition that can
be explained by different formats.</p>
<p>The Buddha described two modes of practice:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wrong practice (<em>micchā-paṭipadā</em>): the incorrect path: the path
giving rise to suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right practice (<em>sammā-paṭipadā</em>): the correct path: the path
leading to the end of suffering. {517}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On one occasion he equated the origination cycle of Dependent
Origination with wrong practice and the cessation cycle with right
practice:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn89">89</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wrong practice: <em>avijjā</em> → <em>saṅkhāra</em> → <em>viññāṇa</em> → ... <em>jāti</em> →
<em>jarāmaraṇa →</em> <em>soka-parideva-dukkha-domanassa-upāyāsā</em> = the origin
of suffering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right practice: ignorance ceases → volitional formations cease →
consciousness ceases → ... birth ceases → aging and death cease →
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair cease = the cessation
of suffering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On another occasion he described the factors that are contrary to the
Path as wrong practice and the factors of the Path as right
practice:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn90">90</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wrong practice: wrong view (<em>micchā-diṭṭhi</em>) + wrong intention
(<em>micchā-saṅkappa</em>) + wrong speech (<em>micchā-vācā</em>) + wrong action
(<em>micchā-kammanta</em>) + wrong livelihood (<em>micchā-ājīva</em>) + wrong
effort (<em>micchā-vāyāma</em>) + wrong mindfulness (<em>micchā-sati</em>) + wrong
concentration (<em>micchā-samādhi</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Right practice: right view (<em>sammā-diṭṭhi</em>) + right intention
(<em>sammā-saṅkappa</em>) + right speech (<em>sammā-vācā</em>) + right action
(<em>sammā-kammanta</em>) + right livelihood (<em>sammā-ājīva</em>) + right effort
(<em>sammā-vāyāma</em>) + right mindfulness (<em>sammā-sati</em>) + right
concentration (<em>sammā-samādhi</em>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Dependent Origination describes a natural, causal process of phenomena;
it is not an outline of practice. Nevertheless, in the first pair of
right and wrong practice above, practice is defined by way of Dependent
Origination. An answer to whether or not this is a contradiction is that
here Dependent Origination emphasizes practice.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn91">91</a></sup></p>
<p>The commentary to this sutta poses the question that if ignorance can
act as a condition for wholesome, meritorious intentions
(<em>puññābhisaṅkhāra</em>) and as a catalyst for highly concentrated states of
mind (<em>āneñjābhisaṅkhāra</em>), then why should it be classified as wrong
practice? The commentary goes on to reply to its own question that
someone who desires existence aims for acquiring and becoming; whatever
they do, even developing the five higher psychic attainments (<em>abhiññā</em>)
or the eight concentrative attainments (<em>samāpatti</em>), is ‘wrong
practice’. On the contrary, one who aspires for Nibbāna with thoughts of
relinquishment (with a clear mind) does not aim for becoming; even if he
or she offers a small gift, this action is ‘right practice’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn92">92</a></sup></p>
<p>In any case, the reason for placing these two preceding pairs of
definitions for right and wrong practice together is simply to help
explain the transition from the cessation cycle to the path of practice.
We can observe here, however, that besides describing a positive cycle
and a correct form of practice, the Buddha also described a negative
cycle and an incorrect form of practice.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#breaking-the-cycle" id="breaking-the-cycle">Breaking the Cycle</a></h2>
<p>The Buddha described another format for the cessation cycle of Dependent
Origination. The initial part of this format begins with the standard
origination cycle, from ignorance to the arising of suffering. From
there, instead of describing the cessation cycle, it describes a
connected process of wholesome qualities leading up to and ending with
awakening. This is a completely new format which does not refer to the
cessation of any of the factors in the origination cycle. {518}</p>
<p>This outline is an important example of applying the factors of the Path
in a system of Dhamma practice; in other words it is a process that
occurs for a person who successfully follows the Path and reaches
perfect realization. The Buddha described this format for liberation on
many occasions, with slight variations in detail:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><em>Avijjā</em> → <em>saṅkhāra</em> → <em>viññāṇa</em> → <em>nāma-rūpa</em> → <em>saḷāyatana</em> →
<em>phassa</em> → <em>vedanā</em> → <em>taṇhā</em> → <em>upādāna</em> → <em>bhava</em> → <em>jāti</em> →
suffering (<em>dukkha</em>) → faith (<em>saddhā</em>) → joy (<em>pāmojja</em>) → delight
(<em>pīti</em>) → tranquillity (<em>passaddhi</em>; ‘relaxation’) → happiness
(<em>sukha</em>) → concentration (<em>samādhi</em>) → knowledge and vision according
to reality (<em>yathābhūta-ñāṇadassana</em>) → disenchantment (<em>nibbidā</em>) →
dispassion (<em>virāga</em>) → liberation (<em>vimutti</em>) → knowledge of the
destruction of mental defilement (<em>khaya-ñāṇa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn93">93</a></sup></em></p>
<p><em>S. II. 31.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This process begins with ignorance until it reaches suffering (the word
<em>dukkha</em> here replaces the terms <em>jarāmaraṇa &amp;
soka-parideva-dukkha-domanassa-upāyāsā</em>). But from this point, instead
of linking with ignorance and resuming the cycle of origination, it
proceeds in a wholesome, positive direction, with faith taking over from
ignorance. It finally reaches knowledge of the destruction of the taints
and does not link up with ignorance again. If one counts suffering as
the pivotal factor, the number of factors both preceding and following
suffering is identical.</p>
<p>This new outline can be divided into two parts: first, from ignorance to
suffering, and second, from faith to knowledge of the destruction of the
taints. In the second part, faith replaces ignorance as the initial
factor. Referring back to an earlier section in this book, one can
recognize that faith here is equivalent to a ‘disciplined’ or weakened
form of ignorance. At this stage ignorance is no longer totally ‘blind’,
but is imbued with a grain of understanding, which buds as an aspiration
to reach a virtuous goal and blossoms into true knowledge and complete
liberation.</p>
<p>In this instance, when the cycle has proceeded from ignorance and
reached suffering, one seeks an escape. If one receives correct
instruction or considers carefully the law of cause and effect, and one
has gained confidence in goodness (the arising of faith – <em>saddhā</em>),
then there will arise joy, contentment, and a determination to gradually
advance in virtue until the end is reached.</p>
<p>The second part of the new outline is in fact the same as the standard
cessation cycle of Dependent Origination (ignorance ceases → volitional
formations cease → consciousness ceases, etc.). This new outline merely
describes the prominent factors of the cycle in greater detail, and
emphasizes the connection between the origination cycle and the
cessation cycle.</p>
<p>In the Nettipakaraṇa<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn94">94</a></sup> the following teaching by the Buddha is
interpreted as a transcendent form of Dependent Origination (i.e. the
mode of cessation): {519}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Virtuous conduct, Ānanda, has the benefit<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn95">95</a></sup> and reward of
non-remorse....<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn96">96</a></sup> Non-remorse has the benefit and reward of joy....
Joy has the benefit and reward of delight.... Delight has the benefit
and reward of tranquillity.... Tranquillity has the benefit and reward
of happiness.... Happiness has the benefit and reward of
concentration.... Concentration has the benefit and reward of
knowledge and vision of things as they really are.... Knowledge and
vision of things as they really are has the benefit and reward of
disenchantment.... Disenchantment has the benefit and reward of
dispassion.... Dispassion has the benefit and reward of the knowledge
and vision of liberation.... In this way, Ānanda, virtuous conduct
brings the succeeding qualities to perfection, for reaching step by
step the fruit of arahantship.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn97">97</a></sup></p>
<p><em>A. V. 311.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This teaching can be illustrated easily as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Virtuous conduct → non-remorse → joy → delight → tranquillity →
happiness → concentration → knowledge and vision of things as they
really are → disenchantment → dispassion → knowledge and vision of
liberation.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This process is almost identical to the outline above, except that it
begins with moral conduct and non-remorse instead of faith, and it only
describes the cessation cycle – it does not refer to the origin of
suffering. It is fair to say, however, that the meanings of the two
formats are essentially the same.</p>
<p>The first format focuses on a situation where faith is the predominant
factor. When a person has faith – faith in virtue and confidence in the
law of cause and effect – this state of mind is connected to conduct.
Faith is supported by virtuous conduct and thus leads to gladness. The
second format focuses on conduct as the predominant factor. In this
situation, the mind has a foundation of faith and confidence, which
promotes virtuous conduct. Virtuous conduct leads to an untroubled mind
– one has self-confidence in one’s good actions. This self-confidence
is an attribute of faith (<em>saddhā</em>), which also leads to gladness, the
following factor. The final factors of the first format end with
liberation and with knowledge of the destruction of the taints, while
the second format ends with knowledge and vision of liberation. These
two endings are identical in meaning; the second format combines
liberation with knowledge of the destruction of the taints into a single
factor.</p>
<p>There is another outline similar to the one beginning with faith, but
here faith is replaced by wise reflection (<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Wise reflection → joy → delight → tranquillity → happiness →
concentration → knowledge and vision according to reality →
disenchantment → dispassion → liberation. {520}</em></p>
<p><em>D. III. 288.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This teaching does not introduce a radically different idea; the process
simply begins with a person’s ability to analyze and to apply wisdom to
investigate cause and effect. Instead of beginning with faith, which is
equivalent to entrusting one’s wisdom to someone or something else, the
process begins with proper attention, which leads to an understanding of
things as they truly are and to a bright and joyous mind. The subsequent
factors are the same as in the preceding formats.</p>

</div>
<p>These processes of cessation shed light on the path of practice and on
the tasks required by human beings. However, they still lack sufficient
details for a comprehensive practice; the question remains as to what is
required to bring about and fulfil these cycles of cessation.</p>
<p>At this point, in order to gain a new perspective let us look at another
format of Dependent Origination:</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#nutriment-of-ignorance" id="nutriment-of-ignorance">Nutriment of Ignorance</a></h3>

</div>
<p>In this teaching two factors play a pivotal role: wise reflection
(<em>yoniso-manasikāra</em>), which is the principle of Buddhist application of
thought and is a key internal attribute; and association with superior
persons (<em>sappurisa-saṁseva</em> = having a ‘beautiful friend’ –
<em>kalyāṇa-mitta</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn99">99</a></sup> which reveals the importance of social factors
and is a key external factor. Faith acts as the link between these two
factors.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn100">100</a></sup></p>
<p>The various outlines of the cessation cycle mentioned above along with
particular forms of practice can be summarized as follows:</p>
<div class="list-none">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1.</strong> The cessation cycle and the path of practice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cessation cycle of Dependent Origination: ignorance ceases →
volitional formations cease → consciousness ceases → ... birth
ceases → aging and death cease → sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief
and despair cease = the cessation of suffering.</em></p>
<p>The Middle Way: right view + right intention + right speech +
right action + right livelihood + right effort + right
mindfulness + right concentration → cessation of suffering.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The cessation cycle explained as a process of wholesome qualities
leading to liberation, in which suffering is the starting point.
This cycle proceeds in an opposite direction to the origination
cycle of suffering, as illustrated on

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3.</strong> A gradual way of practice comprised of (subsidiary) factors of the
Path. This way of practice is not an automatic causal process, but
each step of this process acts as a support for the subsequent
stages of practice. Here is an example of this outline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mutually sustaining qualities: association with superior people →
listening to the true Dhamma → faith → wise reflection →
mindfulness and clear comprehension → sense restraint → good
conduct → foundations of mindfulness → factors of enlightenment →

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The placement of Path factors into a way of practice (as shown above)
can result in many different detailed stages of practice, corresponding
to the specific objective and emphasis of the compiler. The stages of
practice, however, generally conform to the framework and sequence of
the threefold training (moral conduct, concentration, and wisdom),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn102">102</a></sup>
which is a key principle in the application of the Path factors in
Dhamma practice. Following is a brief summary of three further examples
of this last outline of practice which are mentioned frequently in the
scriptures.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#the-fulfilment-of-the-holy-life-brahmacariya" id="the-fulfilment-of-the-holy-life-brahmacariya">The Fulfilment of the Holy Life (brahmacariya)</a></h4>
<p><em>(This way of practice is found frequently in the scriptures. It is
referred to as the fulfilment of the holy life (M. I. 521-2); and it is
equivalent to the threefold training (D. I. 206-209). According to this
format, sense restraint is grouped under ‘concentration’, but in later
texts, e.g. Vism. 15-16 &amp; Comp.: Kammaṭṭhānaparicchedo,
Vipassanākammaṭṭhānaṃ, Visuddhibhedo, it is grouped under moral conduct
and is called the ‘virtuous conduct of sense restraint’
(<em>indriyasaṁvara-sīla</em>), where it is the second factor of the four
‘modes of pure conduct’ (<em>pārisuddhi-sīla</em>). On many occasions
contentment is not mentioned. See also: D. I. 62-85; M. I. 178-84,
265-71, 344-9, 412; M. II. 38, 162-4, 226-7; A. II. 207-208; A. V. 203;

<p><strong>Moral conduct:</strong></p>

moral conduct (the happiness of leading a faultless life –

<p><strong>Concentration:</strong></p>
<p>Restraint of the senses (untarnished happiness – avyāseka-sukha) +
mindfulness and clear comprehension + contentment (santosa) →
(developing concentration in secluded places) → eliminating the
hindrances (= joy – <em>pāmojja</em>) → four jhānas (= the bliss of jhāna –
<em>jhāna-sukha</em>) →</p>

<p>Three kinds of supreme knowledge – <em>vijjā</em> (or the six kinds of direct
knowledge – <em>abhiññā</em>; or the eight kinds of supreme knowledge) →

<p>Fifteen Modes of Conduct (= moral conduct &amp; concentration):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn103">103</a></sup></p>

(<em>jāgariyānuyoga</em>) +</em></p>
<p>Seven essential qualities (<em>saddhamma</em>): (5) faith; (6) moral shame –
<em>hiri</em>; (7) fear of wrongdoing – <em>ottappa</em>; (8) great learning –
<em>bāhusacca</em>; (9) energy – <em>viriya</em>; (10) mindfulness – <em>sati</em>; and
(11) wisdom; + (12-15) four jhānas →</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three Kinds of Supreme Knowledge (= wisdom). The three <em>vijjā</em>:
reminiscence of past lives (<em>pubbenivāsānussati-ñāṇa</em>); knowledge of the
decease and rebirth of beings (<em>cutūpapāta-ñāṇa</em>); knowledge of the
destruction of the taints (<em>āsavakkhaya-ñāṇa</em>).</p>
<p>Occasionally the Buddha emphasized the development of wisdom, for
example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gradual training (<em>anupubba-sikkhā</em>) or gradual practice
(<em>anupubba-paṭipadā</em>):<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn104">104</a></sup></em></p>
<p>Faith (in a teacher) → one seeks out (the teacher) → one approaches
(the teacher) → one is eager to listen (to the teacher) → one listens
to the Dhamma → one memorizes the Dhamma → one examines the meaning of
the teachings → one gains a reflective understanding of the teachings
→ enthusiasm → perseverance → one examines the truth and gains a clear
understanding → resolute effort → one penetrates the truth with
wisdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A well-known teaching that applies to daily life is the teaching on the
ten ‘righteous ways of conduct’ (<em>dhamma-cariyā</em>),<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn105">105</a></sup> which are also
known as the ten ‘wholesome ways of action’ (<em>kusala-kammapatha</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn106">106</a></sup>
In the Pali Canon these qualities are sometimes referred to as ‘noble
qualities’ (<em>ariya-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn107">107</a></sup> The commentaries refer to them as
‘human qualities’ (<em>manussa-dhamma</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn108">108</a></sup> This teaching is an example
of applying the factors of the Path to Dhamma practice:</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#righteous-ways-of-conduct-dhamma-cariyā" id="righteous-ways-of-conduct-dhamma-cariyā">Righteous Ways of Conduct (dhamma-cariyā)</a></h4>
<p><strong>Moral Conduct:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Right Action: abstaining from injury to living creatures –
<em>pāṇātipāta</em> (= mutual kindness and support) + abstaining from taking
what is not freely given – <em>adinnādāna</em> (= respect for personal
property) + abstaining from improper sexual relations –
<em>kāmesumicchācāra</em> (= not violating cherished persons) +</em></p>
<p>Right Speech: abstaining from lying – <em>musāvāda</em> (= truthful speech)</p>
<ul>
<li>abstaining from malicious speech – <em>pisuṇā vācā</em> (= harmonious
speech) + abstaining from harsh speech – <em>pharusa vācā</em> (= polite
speech) + abstaining from frivolous speech – <em>samphappalāpa</em> (=
reasoned, constructive speech) +</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Wisdom:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Right Intention: non-covetousness (<em>anabhijjhā</em>) + non-aggression –
<em>abyāpāda</em> (= lovingkindness) + Right View → happiness (<em>sugati</em>) →
liberation (<em>vimutti</em>). {524}</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people may object that this process does not contain any factors
related to concentration. Although the development of concentration is
generally not emphasized in the context of people’s everyday lives, the
factors related to concentration are included in this process. Right
effort and right mindfulness are necessary factors when developing all
the other factors of the Path.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn109">109</a></sup> Moreover, one definition for
<em>samādhi</em> is the absence of the hindrances (<em>nīvaraṇa</em>), which
corresponds to the eighth and ninth factors of the righteous ways of
conduct (<em>dhamma-cariyā</em>): non-covetousness and non-aggression.
(<em>Abhijjhā</em> – covetousness, or <em>kāma-chanda</em> – sensual desire, is the
first hindrance, and <em>byāpāda</em> – ill-will – is the second). The Buddha
classified non-covetousness and non-aggression as forms of mental
excellence (<em>citta-sampadā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn110">110</a></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of internal spiritual growth, the
entire process of ‘righteous conduct’ is a preparation for the
development and fulfilment of concentration.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn111">111</a></sup></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-1-interpretations-of-dependent-origination" id="appendix-1-interpretations-of-dependent-origination">Appendix 1: Interpretations of Dependent Origination</a></h2>
<p>Earlier, I referred to the passages in the Vibhaṅga (the second volume
of the Abhidhamma) and the Sammohavinodanῑ (the commentary to the
Vibhaṅga) describing the entire sequence of Dependent Origination
occurring in a single mind moment.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn112">112</a></sup> The main commentarial
interpretation of Dependent Origination, however, explains the teaching
exclusively in the context of several lifetimes. When the teaching of
Dependent Origination is interpreted in the context of everyday
experience, those people who hold to the mainstream interpretation may
feel uneasy and object that this former interpretation is unorthodox and
baseless.</p>
<p>Scriptural evidence does exist, however, for the interpretation of
Dependent Origination in the context of everyday life. Although the
interpretation of Dependent Origination as occurring subtly and rapidly
in the present moment differs from the orthodox interpretation, the
evidence is clear and compelling that this former interpretation is
valid. Granted, the remaining traces of evidence are scanty and obscure.
This alternative interpretation was likely overlooked or forgotten. The
reason it survives is because there is substantiating proof in the
Tipiṭaka itself.</p>
<p>The interpretation of Dependent Origination in the context of several
lifetimes originates in the Visuddhimagga, composed by Ven. Buddhaghosa
in the 5th century AD. The Sammohavinodanῑ, however, composed by the
same author, provides an alternative interpretation. {212}</p>
<p>The Sammohavinodanῑ divides the analysis of Dependent Origination into
two sections. Whereas the first section explains the teaching in the
same way as the Visuddhimagga, in the context of several lifetimes, the
second section explains it as occurring in a single mind moment.</p>
<p>It is recorded that Ven. Buddhaghosa wrote the Sammohavinodanῑ after he
wrote the Visuddhimagga. The difference between the two texts is that
Buddhaghosa was free to use a wide range of sources to compose the
Visuddhimagga, while the Sammohavinodanῑ is a commentary exclusively on
the Vibhaṅga of the Abhidhamma.</p>
<p>In the introduction to the Sammohavinodanῑ, Ven. Buddhaghosa claims in
reference to this text: <em>I have compiled and clarified the meaning of an
ancient commentary</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn113">113</a></sup> In the section of the Visuddhimagga dealing
with Dependent Origination, he writes:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>It is inherently difficult to explain Dependent Origination ... Whilst
now I wish to describe the structure of conditions, I find no footing
and seem to founder in a sea. However, the teaching on Dependent
Origination is graced by many modes of exposition, and the ancient
teachers’ way of teaching is handed down unbrokenly. Relying on these
two supports, I now begin to elucidate its meaning.</p>
<p><em>Vism. 522-3; identical to VbhA. 91.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>In contrast to the Sammohavinodanῑ, the Visuddhimagga contains only the
several lifetime explanation and is almost identical to the first
section of the Sammohavinodanῑ, with only a few added details.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn114">114</a></sup></p>
<p>One may ask why there is no equivalent second section in the
Visuddhimagga. A probable answer is that by the time of Ven. Buddhaghosa
the several lifetime explanation had become the prevailing orthodoxy.</p>
<p>And he may have felt more comfortable with this explanation because,
although he considered the whole subject difficult, this explanation was
supported by an unbroken lineage of teachers. The transmission of the
single mind moment explanation had probably been broken, as suggested by
the extreme brevity of this section in the Sammohavinodanῑ. Ven.
Buddhaghosa may have felt obliged to include this second section,
however brief, in the Sammohavinodanῑ in order to be true to the
evidence in the Pali Canon and the traces in the older commentaries.</p>
<p>The Sammohavinodanῑ is a commentary on the Vibhaṅga, the second volume
of the Abhidhamma. The section in the Vibhaṅga explaining Dependent
Origination is called the Paccayākāra-vibhaṅga and is divided into two
parts: the Suttanta-bhājanῑya (an analysis conforming to the suttas) and
the Abhidhamma-bhājanῑya (an analysis conforming to the
Abhidhamma).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn115">115</a></sup> {213}</p>
<p>The Sammohavinodanῑ is similarly divided into two parts and it explains
the difference between the two as follows:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The Teacher describes conditionality ... in the sutta chapter as
occurring in different mind moments. Conditionality does not
exclusively occur in different mind moments, but also occurs in a
single mind moment. The intent here is to describe the ways in which
conditionality occurs in a single mind moment according to the
Abhidhamma chapter.</p>
<p><em>VbhA. 199.</em></p>
<p>In the sutta chapter, conditionality is determined as occurring in
many mind moments; in the Abhidhamma chapter, conditionality is
described in the context of a single mind moment.</p>
<p><em>VbhA. 200.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Here is an example from the Sammohavinodanῑ of Dependent Origination
functioning in everyday life (i.e. in a single mind moment):</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Birth [aging, and death] here refers to the birth [aging, and
death] of immaterial things, not to a broken tooth, greying hair,
wrinkled skin, dying, or passing [from this state of existence].</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the sutta chapter of the Vibhaṅga dealing with
conditionality in the context of several mind moments (i.e. emphasizing
several lifetimes) covers only four pages; in contrast, the Abhidhamma
chapter concerning conditionality in the context of a single mind moment
covers fifty-four pages.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn116">116</a></sup> In the Sammohavinodanῑ, however, these
proportions are reversed: the sutta chapter runs to seventy pages, while
the Abhidhamma chapter covers fourteen pages.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn117">117</a></sup> The reason this
latter division in the Sammohavinodanῑ is so brief may be because Ven.
Buddhaghosa did not have much to say about this subject, or it may be
because he felt the subject had already been covered in great detail and
therefore it did not need to be expanded upon.</p>
<p>In sum, the basis for the interpretation of Dependent Origination in the
context of everyday life is found in the Pali Canon and traces of it
remain in the commentaries. It has merely faded in prominence, been
forgotten, or been overlooked. {214}</p>

<p>The Buddha presented two key classifications which he referred to as
dhamma-niyāmatā, which may be translated as ‘certainty of nature’,
‘natural order’, or ‘law of nature’. This term refers to naturally
existing principles of truth or to independently existing truths of
nature (whether a Buddha appears or not, these truths exist according to
their own inherent properties).</p>
<p>These two classifications of *dhamma-*niyāmatā are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Idappaccayatā</em>: ‘specific conditionality’; the law of Dependent
Origination comprising twelve factors.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn118">118</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Aniccatā</em>, <em>dukkhatā</em> &amp; <em>anattatā</em>: the laws of impermanence,
<em>dukkha</em>, and nonself. Beginning with the commentaries, these three
factors are referred to as the ‘Three Characteristics’
(<em>tilakkhaṇa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn119">119</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Technically, these dual principles are referred to by a pair of terms –
<em>dhammaṭṭhitatā</em> &amp; <em>dhammāniyāmatā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn120">120</a></sup></p>
<p>Although these two classifications have been explained at length in
chapter 3 and in this present chapter, at this point it is useful to
provide a summary.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#these-natural-laws-comprise-four-factors-linked-to-the-four-noble-truths" id="these-natural-laws-comprise-four-factors-linked-to-the-four-noble-truths">These Natural Laws Comprise Four Factors Linked to the Four Noble Truths</a></h3>
<p>The law of Dependent Origination (or ‘specific conditionality’) combined
with the three laws of impermanence, dukkha, and nonself, comprise four
factors, which in the Pali Canon are described as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>‘Whether Tathāgatas appear or not, this truth exists as constant and
stable, that is, specific conditionality.’</p>
<p>(<em>Uppādā vā tathāgatānaṃ anuppādā vā tathāgatānaṃ ṭhitāva sā dhātu

</li>
<li>
<p>‘Monks, whether Tathāgatas appear or not, this truth exists as
constant and stable, that is, all conditioned phenomena are
impermanent.’</p>
<p>(<em>Uppādā vā bhikkhave tathāgatānaṃ anuppādā vā tathāgatānaṃ ṭhitāva

{215}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Monks, whether Tathāgatas appear or not, this truth exists as
constant and stable, that is, all conditioned phenomena are
unenduring.’</p>
<p>(<em>Uppādā vā bhikkhave tathāgatānaṃ anuppādā vā tathāgatānaṃ ṭhitāva
sā dhātu dhammaṭṭhitatā dhamma-niyāmatā sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhāti.</em>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Monks, whether Tathāgatas appear or not, this truth exists as
constant and stable, that is, all things are nonself.’</p>
<p>(<em>Uppādā vā bhikkhave tathāgatānaṃ anuppādā vā tathāgatānaṃ ṭhitāva
sā dhātu dhammaṭṭhitatā dhammaniyāmatā sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhāti.</em>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In brief, the factors are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Idappaccayatā</em>: the law of specific conditionality (=
<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em> – Dependent Origination).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Aniccatā</em>: the law of impermanence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dukkhatā</em>: the law of unendurability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Anattatā</em>: the law of nonself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The law of Dependent Origination reveals how the five aggregates exist
as mutual, interrelated causes and conditions. This law deals with the
existence of conditioned phenomena (<em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>), which comprise
all phenomena in the conventional world.</p>
<p>The laws of <em>aniccatā</em> and <em>dukkhatā</em> reveal how all conditioned
phenomena (i.e. the five aggregates) are without exception impermanent
and unenduring.</p>
<p>The law of <em>anattatā</em> reveals how all things – both conditioned things
and the Unconditioned (<em>asaṅkhata</em>), things both within the five
aggregates and transcending the five aggregates (<em>khandha-vimutti</em>) –
are nonself.</p>
<p>The law of Dependent Origination reveals how the interrelationship
between the five aggregates creates a dynamic that gives rise to
suffering, which is specifically referred to as the ‘cycle of
origination’ (<em>paṭiccasamuppāda-samudayavāra</em>). This corresponds to the
second noble truth: the noble truth of the cause of suffering
(<em>samudaya-ariyasacca</em>).</p>
<p>Specific conditionality by itself indicates the impermanence and
unendurability of the five aggregates – of all conditioned phenomena.
(<em>Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā, sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā</em>.)</p>
<p>Because the five aggregates are subject to ‘specific conditionality’,
are marked by impermanence and unendurability, and in addition to this
fall under the sway of the law of nonself, they act as a basis and cause
for suffering, or they are the gathering point for potential suffering
to arise. This corresponds to the first noble truth: the Noble Truth of
suffering (<em>dukkha-ariyasacca</em>).</p>
<p>In the end analysis, conditioned formations (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) are natural
phenomena (<em>sabhāva-dhamma</em>), which means that they have their own
character or nature (<em>bhāva</em>). They do not constitute a stable, fixed,
substantial identity, they do not belong to anyone, nor can they be
governed or dictated by anyone in any real sense. As conditioned
phenomena, they exist according to specific causes and conditions; their
impermanence and unendurability is a result of this conditionality. No
one can force them to be otherwise. They are thus included within the
province of the law of nonself (<em>sabbe dhammā anattā</em>).</p>
<p>Apart from conditioned phenomena, there also exists the Unconditioned,
which transcends specific conditionality and is not created by
conditioning factors. It is permanent (<em>nicca</em>) and free from <em>dukkha</em>;
it constitutes the cessation of <em>dukkha</em> (<em>dukkha-nirodha</em>). This
corresponds to the third noble truth: the noble truth of the cessation
of suffering (<em>nirodha-ariyasacca</em>), namely, Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The Unconditioned, likewise, is a natural phenomenon, which means that
it too does not constitute a stable, fixed, substantial identity, it
does not belong to anyone, nor can it be governed or dictated by anyone.
It too is nonself (<em>anattā</em>). For this reason, the fourth law – of
nonself – pertains to all things, both conditioned things (<em>saṅkhāra</em>)
and the Unconditioned (<em>visaṅkhāra</em>), both constructed things
(<em>saṅkhata-dhammā</em>) and the Unconstructed (<em>asaṅkhata-dhamma</em>). {216}</p>
<p>The Unconditioned is not subject to the ‘cycle of origination’
(<em>samudaya-vāra</em>); instead, it is realized as the final goal of the
‘cycle of cessation’ (<em>nirodha-vāra</em>). It is reached by the stopping,
ceasing, non-existence, and non-arising of Dependent Origination
(<em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>). Although it passes beyond the realm of conditioned
phenomena, and it is permanent and free from <em>dukkha</em>, it shares the
characteristic of nonself with all other natural phenomena. It does not
belong to anyone, it does not manifest as some form of being, it does
not constitute a ‘self’, nor is it subject to anyone’s will. It exists
according to its own inherent nature.</p>
<p>The noble truth of the path leading to the cessation of suffering
(<em>dukkhanirodhagāminīpaṭipadā-ariyasacca</em>), or the Path (<em>magga</em>) for
short, comprises those means applied for ending and eliminating the
cycle of origination or for reverting to the cycle of cessation. There
are many details to this path of practice (referred to as the Noble
Eightfold Path), which is fulfilled by completing the threefold
training. Essentially, the entire Path involves abandoning the
unwholesome and developing the wholesome, both of which exist within the
sphere of the five aggregates. (One may describe this as ‘developing the
wholesome aggregates (<em>kusala-khandha</em>), or even as ‘developing the
aggregates’.) This factor of the Path is thus characterized by
impermanence, <em>dukkha</em>, and nonself.</p>
<p>In sum:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first law of nature (<em>idappaccayatā</em>) reveals the state of
conditioned phenomena (this is the gist of the second noble truth).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second and third laws of nature (<em>aniccatā</em> &amp; <em>dukkhatā</em>) reveal
the shared attributes of conditioned phenomena (encompassing the
first, second, and fourth noble truths).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fourth law (<em>anattatā</em>) reveals the shared attribute of all
things – of all phenomena (encompassing all four noble truths).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#suchness-tathatā" id="suchness-tathatā">Suchness (tathatā)</a></h3>
<p>Both when introducing specific conditionality and when introducing the
Three Characteristics, the Buddha used the two terms <em>dhammaṭṭhitatā</em> &amp;
<em>dhammaniyāmatā</em>. Yet at the end of these passages, in the context of
specific conditionality the term <em>idappaccayatā</em> is preceded by three
additional terms (<em>tathatā</em>, <em>avitathatā</em>, &amp; <em>anaññathatā</em>), which are
absent in the passages describing the three characteristics:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Iti kho bhikkhave yā tatra tathatā avitathatā anaññathatā
idappaccayatā ayaṃ vuccati bhikkhave paṭiccasamuppādo.</em></p>
<p>‘Monks, suchness (tathatā; the state of existing ‘just so’), inerrancy
(avitathatā; the state of not deviating from existing as such), and
invariability (anaññathatā; the state of not being otherwise) is
specific conditionality; indeed, all this cited here is Dependent
Origination.’</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>These three additional terms are used for special emphasis or to draw
special attention. But because they are concise and striking, they are
alluded to frequently, to the extent of being well-known and finding
public favour. The term <em>tathatā</em>, in particular, is mentioned
frequently in Buddhist circles, and because this term is only found in
connection with specific conditionality (Dependent Origination), people
may believe that it only refers to this subject.</p>
<p>The following words of the Buddha provide a broad perspective on this
matter:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, these four things are actual (tathā), unerring (avitathā), not
otherwise (anaññathā). What four? ‘This is suffering’.... ‘This is the
origin of suffering’.... ‘This is the cessation of suffering’....
‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’: this is
actual, unerring, not otherwise....</p>
<p>Therefore, monks, you should make an exertion to understand: ‘This is
suffering’ ... ‘This is the path leading to the cessation of
suffering.’ {217}</p>
<p><em>S. V. 430; Ps. II. 104.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Note that in this context the three aforementioned terms refer to the
Four Noble Truths, and they are used to supplement the meaning of the
word <em>sacca</em> (’truth’). In the commentaries and sub-commentaries, the
Four Noble Truths are sometimes referred to as <em>tatha-dhamma</em> (’true
phenomena’), in a similar way as they are sometimes referred to as
<em>sacca-dhamma</em> (’truths’). (The term <em>sacca-dhamma</em>, however, does not
always refer to the Four Noble Truths.</p>
<p>There are other noteworthy passages in the Tipiṭaka in which the Four
Noble Truths are referred to by these three aforementioned terms. The
passage below follows on from the passage cited above:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>How is suffering (<em>dukkha</em>) a truth (<em>sacca</em>) in the sense that it is
‘just so’ (<em>tathā</em>)? There are four definitions of suffering
characterizing it as being just so (<em>tathā</em>), inerrant (<em>avitathā</em>),
and invariable (<em>anaññathā</em>). There is the definition of suffering as
oppression, there is the definition of suffering as compounded, there
is the definition of suffering as a state of burning, and there is the
definition of suffering as fluctuation....</p>
<p>How is the origin (<em>samudaya</em>; cause of suffering) a truth in the
sense that it is ‘just so’? There are four definitions of the origin
characterizing it as being just so, inerrant, and invariable. There is
the definition of the origin as the merging of originating factors,
there is the definition of the origin as cause (<em>nidāna</em>; ‘source’),
there is the definition of origination as bound, and there is the
definition of origination as obstructed....</p>
<p>How is cessation (<em>nirodha</em>) a truth in the sense that it is ‘just
so’? There are four definitions of cessation characterizing it as
being just so, inerrant, and invariable. There is the definition of
cessation as freedom, there is the definition of cessation as
tranquil, there is the definition of cessation as uncompounded, and
there is the definition of cessation as deathless....</p>
<p>How is the Path (<em>magga</em>) a truth in the sense that it is ‘just so’?
There are four definitions of the Path characterizing it as being just
so, inerrant, and invariable. There is the definition of the Path as a
factor for release, there is the definition of the Path as cause,
there is the definition of the Path as discernment, and there is the
definition of the Path as sovereignty.</p>
<p><em>Ps. II. 104-105.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Here are the concluding passages summarizing the Four Noble Truths:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>By way of how many attributes are the four truths realized in unison?
The four truths are realized in unison by way of four attributes: in
the sense of being actual; in the sense of being nonself; in the sense
of being true; in the sense of being penetrating.</p>
<p>The four truths are integrated as one by way of these four attributes,
seeing that each one of these unified truths is constant, realized by
an equivalent knowledge. For this reason these four truths are
realized in unison.</p>
<p><em>Ps. 105.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The term <em>tathatā</em> refers to the state of being ‘such’ (<em>tatha</em>), just
as <em>aniccatā</em> refers to the state of being impermanent (<em>anicca</em>),
<em>dukkhatā</em> refers to the state of being subject to stress (<em>dukkha</em>),
and <em>anattatā</em> refers to the state of being nonself (<em>anattā</em>). (Here,
the suffix <em>-tā</em> means ‘state’.)</p>
<p>The fundamentals of the Pali language in the original texts makes it
quite clear for distinguishing the meanings of various terms. Later on,
however, some of these meanings have become mixed up, which may cause
confusion.</p>
<p>The important feature to note here is that in the context of these
various laws the suffix <em>-tā</em> is frequently applied. For example, when
the Buddha spoke about the law of nature, he used the term
<em>dhamma-niyāmatā</em>, which refers to the state (<em>-tā</em>), the properties,
the qualities, or the existence of phenomena, which are part of a
natural order.</p>
<p>The shorter term <em>dhamma-niyāma</em> began to be used in the commentaries,
and it was used here in a broader sense. It is sometimes synonymous with
<em>dhamma-niyāmatā</em> (as defined above), while at other times it refers to
specific phenomena acting as conditions within the process of Dependent
Origination.</p>
<p>Likewise, the term <em>dhammaṭṭhitatā</em> refers to the state, properties, or
existence of phenomena that accord with causes and conditions. The
shorter term <em>dhammaṭṭhiti</em> may also convey this same meaning, but it
usually refers to specific phenomena which act as conditions or are
subject to causes and conditions. {218}</p>
<p>The terms <em>aniccatā</em>, <em>dukkkhatā</em>, and <em>anattatā</em> refer to the state,
property, or existence of phenomena marked by impermanence, stress, and
nonself, as described earlier.</p>
<p>In this book <em>Buddhadhamma</em>, the term <em>dhamma-niyāma</em> is generally used
as synonymous with <em>dhamma-niyāmatā</em>, referring to the properties and
qualities of things, rather than to the things themselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, the terms <em>dhammaniyāmatā</em>, <em>idappaccayatā</em>, <em>tathatā</em>,
<em>aniccatā</em>, <em>anattatā</em>, etc. are not interchangeable with such terms as
the ‘five aggregates’, ‘Nibbāna’, ‘conditioned phenomena’, ‘compounded
things’, and the ‘Unconditioned’.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#terms-pertaining-to-the-three-characteristics-tilakkhaṇa" id="terms-pertaining-to-the-three-characteristics-tilakkhaṇa">Terms Pertaining to the Three Characteristics (tilakkhaṇa)</a></h3>
<p>The Pali term tilakkhaṇa (’three characteristics’) is familiar to many
students of Buddhism. This is not an original term and it does not
appear in the Tipiṭaka; rather, it became a popular term in the
commentaries. In the Tipiṭaka, the Three Characteristics are referred to
as the three laws of nature (<em>dhamma-niyāmatā</em>), and there is no
collective term for these three factors. Although they are described in
many different formats, they are mentioned separately. For example:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Monks, form is impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perception is
impermanent, volitional formations are impermanent, consciousness is
impermanent.... Form is subject to stress, feeling is subject to
stress, perception is subject to stress, volitional formations are
subject to stress, consciousness is subject to stress.... Form is
nonself, feeling is nonself, perception is nonself, volitional
formations are nonself, consciousness is nonself.</p>
<p><em>S. III. 21.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Although there is a term in Pali that translates as ‘three
characteristics’, namely, <em>tīṇi lakkhaṇāni</em>, it refers to distinct
groups of characteristics. The closest group to this context contains
the three characteristics of conditioned phenomena (<em>saṅkhata-dhamma</em>):
<em>uppāda-lakkhaṇa</em> (the characteristic of arising), <em>vaya-lakkhaṇa</em> (the
characteristic of passing away), &amp; <em>ṭhitaññathatta-lakkhaṇa</em> (the
characteristic of abiding and becoming otherwise), but this group has
its own collective term (i.e. <em>saṅkhata-lakkhaṇa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn121">121</a></sup></p>
<p>The term <em>sāmañña-lakkhaṇa</em> (’universal characteristics’) likewise is
not an original term from the Tipiṭaka, but is used frequently in the
commentaries. It is used for comparison, describing how all things are
endowed with two kinds of attributes: unique attributes
(<em>paccatta-lakkhaṇa</em>) and shared attributes (<em>sāmañña-lakkhaṇa</em>). For
example: a unique attribute of physical form (<em>rūpa</em>) is that it is
under strain, and a unique attribute of feeling (<em>vedanā</em>) is that it
feels sense impressions, but both form and feeling share the attributes
of impermanence, <em>dukkha</em>, and nonself.</p>
<p>The term <em>visesa-lakkhaṇa</em> (’unique characteristic’, ‘special
characteristic’) is occasionally used in place of <em>paccatta-lakkhaṇa</em>.
In this case, the same distinction is made, between unique
characteristics and universal characteristics.</p>
<p>There are other similar distinctions occurring in the scriptures. For
example, ultimate truths (<em>paramattha-dhamma</em>) are endowed with two
attributes: attributes of an individual nature (<em>sabhāva-lakkhaṇa</em>) and
universal attributes (<em>sāmañña-lakkhaṇa</em>). Attributes of an individual
nature are sometimes referred to simply as ‘individual attributes’
(<em>salakkhaṇa</em>).</p>
<p>‘Direct knowledge’ (<em>abhiññā</em>) is a unique kind of wisdom, the function
of which is to understand the individual attributes of things
(<em>sabhāva-lakkhaṇa</em>). It may also be translated as ‘penetrative
knowledge’. (It is equivalent to <em>abhijāna.</em> Note that this is not the
same definition of <em>abhiññā</em> used to denote the five or six kinds of
supreme knowledge.)</p>
<p>By understanding clearly with direct knowledge, one has reached an
initial stage of ‘thorough knowledge’ (<em>pariññā</em>) called ‘knowledge of
recognition’ (<em>ñāta-pariññā</em>). The understanding of universal
attributes, on the other hand, is the function of wisdom called
‘investigative knowledge’ (<em>tīraṇa-pariññā</em>). {219}</p>
<p>Note also that the term <em>sāmañña-lakkhaṇa</em> (’universal characteristics’)
is not fixed to the principles of impermanence, <em>dukkha</em>, and nonself.
For example, it is sometimes stated in the scriptures that all
formations (<em>saṅkhāra</em>) possess the universal characteristic of existing
according to causes and conditions.</p>
<p>These three terms – <em>aniccatā</em>, <em>dukkhatā</em>, &amp; <em>anattatā</em> – in this
particular grammatical structure do not appear anywhere in the Tipiṭaka
as a group; instead, they are used separately, according to different
circumstances.</p>
<p>Although the term <em>aniccatā</em> is found fairly frequently in the Tipiṭaka,
it is most often used while explaining the breaking up of material
things (<em>rūpa-dhamma</em>), including in the context of physical death
(<em>maraṇa</em>). It is never used explicitly by the Buddha himself (it is
used by Ven. Sāriputta and by other disciples, and in explanations
within the Abhidhamma). The term <em>dukkhatā</em> was used by the Buddha, but
only in the context of the three kinds of <em>dukkha</em> (<em>dukkha-dukkhatā</em>,
<em>saṅkhāra-dukkhatā</em>, &amp; <em>vipariṇāma-dukkhatā</em>). The term <em>anattatā</em> does
not appear anywhere in the Tipiṭaka.</p>
<p>Because the commentators regularly mentioned and explained this
collection of three factors, they came up with a convenient abbreviation
to refer to them individually, by simply adding the term <em>ādi</em>
(’beginning with’) to <em>aniccatā</em>, e.g.: <em>aniccatādi-paṭisaṁyuttaṃ</em>,
<em>aniccatādi-lakkhaṇattayaṃ</em>, <em>aniccatādi-vasena</em>,
<em>aniccatādi-sāmaññalakkhaṇaṃ</em>, and <em>aniccatādinaṃ</em>. Only in the
sub-commentaries were these three terms combined into a distinct group,
although, even here, this presentation is not common.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#terms-pertaining-to-specific-conditionality-idappaccayatā" id="terms-pertaining-to-specific-conditionality-idappaccayatā">Terms Pertaining to Specific Conditionality (idappaccayatā)</a></h3>
<p>The principle of the first law of nature (of specific conditionality) is
acknowledged to be profound and extremely difficult to understand. From
an initial and incomprehensive examination, it appears that this
principle was almost not mentioned at all in traditional Thai texts and
literary works. Only in the last century was it included in formal
Dhamma educational systems, and at the beginning of this period the most
popular term for this principle was paṭiccasamuppāda.</p>
<p>As far as I can discern, the reason why in scholarly circles this
principle was specifically referred to as paṭiccasamuppāda stems from
Somdet Phra Mahāsamaṇa Chao Krom Phraya Vajirañāṇavarorasa establishing
the system of Dhamma studies known as nak tham. He wrote an explanation
of paṭiccasamuppāda in the book titled Dhammavibhāga Pariccheda Vol. II,
which is assigned to second level nak tham students in Dhamma studies
(pariyatti-dhamma).</p>
<p>The term paṭiccasamuppāda appears frequently in the Tipiṭaka, the
commentaries, and the sub-commentaries. It is thus apt that students of
Buddhism are familiar with it. It is noteworthy, however, that
idappaccayatā, which is a key term in this context (it usually
accompanies and precedes the term paṭiccasamuppāda) seems to have gone
unnoticed. This seems to indicate that those students engaged in this
recent system of Dhamma studies did not extend their research beyond the
course books assigned to them. Only within the past fifty years did this
latter term become more prominent. As far as I can gather, the reason
for this resurgence stems from Ven. Buddhadasa Bhikkhu’s determined
teachings on this principle, along with his frequent emphasis on the
term idappaccayatā.</p>
<p>There were two occasions when the Buddha mentioned this term
idappaccayatā. First, soon after his awakening, he stated that ordinary
people would find it extremely difficult to understand the truth that he
had realized, and therefore it would cause him hardship to try and teach
it to them. The second time he mentioned this term was in his frequent
exposition of this first law of nature. Apart from these occasions, the
term only appears in the two forms of idappaccayā and
idappaccayatā-paṭiccasamuppannesu.</p>
<p>The term paccayākāra (’mode of conditionality’), which is another
synonym for paṭiccasamuppāda and is included in the second level nak
tham textbooks, was coined later. It does not appear in the main body of
the Suttanta Piṭaka; it first appears in the Apadāna, which is a later
addition to the collection of suttas. The term appears twice in the same
section (in a heading and in the text) describing the biography of
Ven. Khemā Therī, the chief bhikkhuni disciple of the Buddha, who sat at
his righthand side and was foremost in wisdom.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn122">122</a></sup></p>
<p>Although the Vinaya Piṭaka contains a lengthy biography of the Buddha,
beginning with the period after his awakening when he was experiencing
the bliss of deliverance and contemplating the law of Dependent
Origination, there is no mention in the entire Tipiṭaka of this term
paccayākāra. {220}</p>
<p>The Abhidhamma contains a lengthy section – the Vibhaṅga (approx. 75
pages) – devoted entirely to the subject of Dependent Origination, but
nowhere in this text does the word <em>paccayākāra</em> appear. Nor does the
term <em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em> appear in this text; there are only references
to phenomena being ‘conditionally arisen’ (<em>paṭiccasamuppanna</em>) or
‘specifically conditioned &amp; conditionally arisen’
(<em>idappaccayatā-paṭiccasamuppanna</em>). The terms appear here only in
headings, which later compilers of this text created, and these headings
differ according to various editions. The Thai Siam Raṭṭha edition
contains the heading Paccayakāra Vibhaṅgo, while the Burmese
Chaṭṭhasaṅgīti edition contains the heading Paṭiccasamuppāda Vibhaṅgo.</p>
<p>In sum, the word most often used in the Tipiṭaka for this law of nature
is <em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em>, occurring either on its own or in conjunction
with <em>idappaccayatā</em>. Most of these references occur in the Suttanta
Piṭaka. Only seldom is this word used in the Vinaya Piṭaka. In the
Abhidhamma, it occurs explicitly only in the Kathāvatthu. Apart from
this, the Dhammasaṅgaṇī contains the word <em>paṭiccasamuppāda-kusalatā</em>,
and there is a single passage in the Dhātukathā (at the end of the
tabulated summary – <em>mātikā</em>) with an interesting sequence of
qualities: <em>pañcakkhandhā dvādasāyatanāni aṭṭhārasa dhātuyo cattāri
saccāni bāvīsatindriyāni paṭiccasamuppādo cattāro satipaṭṭhānā cattāro
sammappadhānā cattāro iddhipādā</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn123">123</a></sup></p>
<p>Beginning with the commentaries, the terms <em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em> and
<em>paccayākāra</em> were used frequently. The term <em>idappaccayatā</em> was also
used, but less frequently.</p>
<p>Another interesting observation is that stemming from the combined terms
<em>dhammaṭṭhitatā dhammaniyāmatā</em>, which together constitute a name for
this law of nature, there was derived another important term –
<em>dhammaṭṭhiti-ñāṇa</em>, which appears in the Buddha’s words:
<em>dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇaṃ pubbe pacchā nibbāne ñāṇaṃ</em> (’knowledge of constancy
first, knowledge of Nibbāna afterwards’, or ‘endowed first with
knowledge of constancy, knowledge of Nibbāna ensues’).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn124">124</a></sup></p>
<p>The Buddha spoke these words to Ven. Susima, who had previously been a
religious wanderer (<em>paribbājaka</em>) and had asked to be ordained in the
Buddhist Dhamma and Discipline. He maintained the misunderstanding that
arahants must all be endowed with psychic powers, for instance the
divine ear and the divine eye. The Buddha spoke this passage to free him
from this misunderstanding and to explain to him that those arahants who
are ‘liberated by way of wisdom’ (<em>paññā-vimutta</em>) realize full
awakening by generating ‘knowledge of constancy’ (<em>dhammaṭṭhiti-ñāṇa</em>),
followed by a knowledge of Nibbāna, without requiring any sort of
psychic powers.</p>
<p>Knowledge of constancy (<em>dhammaṭṭhiti-ñāṇa</em>) is equivalent to an insight
into laws of nature: the clear understanding that all phenomena (as part
of the five aggregates) are impermanent, <em>dukkha</em>, and nonself, and that
they are mutually conditioned, giving rise to results within the
origination cycle of Dependent Origination. Eventually, one discerns the
end of causes and conditions within the origination cycle and realizes
the cessation cycle, culminating in a realization of Nibbāna.</p>
<p>Although according to the Buddha’s words above, the knowledge of
constancy (<em>dhammaṭṭhiti-ñāṇa</em>) encompasses both the insight into the
Three Characteristics and into Dependent Origination culminating in the
completion of the cessation cycle, concise explanations, e.g. in the
description of the seventy-seven kinds of knowledge (<em>ñāṇa</em>) found in
the very same volume, the Buddha mentions or emphasizes only Dependent
Origination (the origination cycle).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn125">125</a></sup></p>
<p>In later texts of the Tipitaka, the knowledge of constancy
(<em>dhammaṭṭhiti-ñāṇa</em>) was more frequently mentioned, and its meaning or
emphasis was associated specifically with Dependent Origination. The
Paṭisambhidāmagga, for instance, defines it as wisdom that comprehends
conditioning factors (<em>paccaya-pariggaha</em>; this knowledge was later
referred to as <em>paccayapariggaha-ñāṇa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn126">126</a></sup> <em>Dhammaṭṭhiti-ñāṇa</em> (or
<em>paccayapariggaha-ñāṇa</em> or <em>paccayakāra-ñāṇa</em>) is also frequently
mentioned and explained in the commentaries and sub-commentaries. For
example, in these texts it is equated with ‘purity of transcending
doubts’ (<em>kaṅkhāvitaraṇa-visuddhi</em>). It is sometimes called ‘knowledge
according to reality’ (<em>yathābhūta-ñāṇa</em>), ‘right vision’
(<em>sammā-dassana</em>), or ‘insight knowledge’ (<em>vipassanā-ñāṇa</em>). It is
occasionally described as knowledge reaching the pinnacle of insight
into specific conditionality (<em>idappaccayatā</em>). The knowledge of Nibbāna
(<em>nibbāna-ñāṇa</em>) is equated with Path knowledge (<em>magga-ñāṇa</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn127">127</a></sup></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#all-encompassing-principles-of-truth" id="all-encompassing-principles-of-truth">All-encompassing Principles of Truth</a></h3>
<p>In the Buddha’s own words describing his awakening, he outlined the two
truths that he had realized. This appears very clearly in his reflection
several weeks after his awakening, when he states that he had realized
idappaccayatā-paṭiccasamuppāda and Nibbāna, truths that go against the
stream and are difficult for ordinary people to understand.
Consequently, he was disinclined to teach the Dhamma.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn128">128</a></sup> {221}</p>
<p>In the Vinaya Piṭaka the Buddha describes the events after his
awakening, after which time he experienced the bliss of liberation under
the Bodhi tree, taught the First Sermon, acquired his first disciples,
performed various ordinations resulting in the creation of the monastic
community (<em>saṅgha</em>), and finally established the monastic discipline.</p>
<p>The Buddha’s reflection cited above occurred (according to the
commentarial account) after he had enjoyed the bliss of liberation for
seven weeks, and before he departed from the place of awakening in order
to teach the Dhamma in the Deer Park at Isipatana near the city of
Varanasi.</p>
<p>Let us go back to the very beginning of this period. During the first
night of experiencing the bliss of liberation, he gave three inspired
utterances, one during each of the three watches of the night. Here, he
contemplates Dependent Origination, both in its forward and reverse
sequences (<em>paṭiccasamuppādaṃ anuloma-paṭilomaṃ manasākāsi</em>; note that
here the term <em>paṭiccasamuppāda</em> appears alone, without the accompanying
term <em>idappaccayatā</em>).</p>
<p>In contrast to later teachings, here the Buddha does not clearly name
the truths that he had realized, but it is not difficult to discern that
he is using synonyms for Dependent Origination and Nibbāna:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Verse no. 1: ‘When truths manifest to a purified one,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn129">129</a></sup> diligent
and meditative, all doubts vanish away, since he knows the truth
together with its cause’ (<em>sahetu-dhamma</em> = suffering and its origin).</p>
<p>Verse no. 2: ‘When truths manifest to a purified one, diligent and
meditative, all doubts vanish away, since he has realized the
cessation of conditioning factors’ (<em>khayaṃ paccayānaṃ</em> = Nibbāna).</p>
<p>Verse no. 3: ‘When truths manifest to a purified one, diligent and
meditative, then he dispels Māra and his forces, and remains like the
sun illuminating the sky.’</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The gist of the first verse is the forward sequence (<em>anuloma</em>) of
Dependent Origination (which is sometimes referred to in the
commentaries as the origination cycle – <em>samudaya-vāra</em>). This verse
reveals the origin of suffering – the process of causes and conditions
giving rise to suffering. In other words, it describes suffering along
with its causes.</p>
<p>The gist of the second verse is the reverse sequence (<em>paṭiloma</em>) of
Dependent Origination (which is sometimes referred to in the
commentaries as the cessation cycle – <em>nirodha-vāra</em>). This verse
reveals the cessation of suffering (<em>dukkha-nirodha</em>), the state free
from suffering, the state in which no renewed suffering arises due to
the exhaustion of all causes and conditions leading to suffering. This
refers to the end of Dependent Origination – to Nibbāna.</p>
<p>The third verse describes the state of awakening, the state of one who
has realized cessation – realized Nibbāna – one whose wisdom is clear,
spacious, and free. The commentaries explain that this verse describes
the splendour and majesty of the noble Path (<em>ariya-magga</em>).</p>
<p>This collection of three inspired verses points to and explains the same
truths expressed in the Buddha’s later reflection cited above. They
reveal how the practice for reaching the goal of Buddhism – for
realizing the supreme truth of Nibbāna – requires a comprehension of
this first law of nature (<em>dhamma-niyāma</em>), i.e. the law of Dependent
Origination. In this way, one realizes two levels of truth encompassing
all things, namely, the truth of all conditioned phenomena and the
supreme truth (<em>parama-sacca</em>) of the Unconditioned.</p>
<p>It is important to reiterate that a realization of this first law of
nature is combined with and equivalent to an understanding of the
remaining three laws of nature – of impermanence, <em>dukkha</em>, and
nonself.</p>
<p>There are many passages in the Suttanta Piṭaka in which the Buddha
recounts his going forth and his spiritual exertions up to the time of
his awakening.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn130">130</a></sup> A key passage in this context pertains to the time
when he was awakened: {222}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>When my mind was concentrated ... I directed it to knowledge of the
destruction of the taints. I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is
suffering’, ‘this is the origin of suffering’, ‘this is the cessation
of suffering’, ‘this is the way leading to the cessation of
suffering’. I directly knew as it actually is: ‘These are the taints’,
‘this is the origin of the taints’, ‘this is the cessation of the
taints’, ‘this is the way leading to the cessation of the taints’.
When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated ...</p>
<p><em>E.g.: M. I. 247-9.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This passage indicates clearly that the Buddha realized the Four Noble
Truths at the time of his awakening. This may seem to be at variance
with the passages cited above, but when one analyses these different
passages carefully, one sees that they refer essentially to the same
thing.</p>
<p>Technically, the Four Noble Truths are comprised of two pairs of truths:
<em>dukkha</em> &amp; <em>samudaya</em> and <em>nirodha</em> &amp; <em>magga</em>. According to the Buddha’s
first sermon, the Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta, which in the Vinaya Piṭaka
follows on from the Buddha’s reflections cited earlier, <em>samudaya</em>
(’origin’) refers to the three kinds of craving (<em>taṇhā</em>), and <em>nirodha</em>
(’cessation’) refers to the renouncing, abandoning, and cessation of all
such craving – to complete liberation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn131">131</a></sup> At first glance, one may
not yet see the connection here to the natural law of Dependent
Origination.</p>
<p>Craving (<em>taṇhā</em>) is a vital factor in the forward sequence of Dependent
Origination (or the cycle of origination) resulting in suffering. The
first and second noble truths thus exist as a pair. The reverse sequence
of Dependent Origination (the cycle of cessation) is the dissolution of
all conditioning factors within the dynamic of suffering – the end of
Dependent Origination. This corresponds to cessation (<em>nirodha</em>), the
third noble truth. The fourth noble truth – the Path (<em>magga</em>) – is a
formal method of spiritual practice established for people to give rise
to the natural process of the reverse sequence. The Path is thus
included in the reverse sequence of Dependent Origination. This is a
very brief summary of how these principles are interlinked.</p>
<p>The commentaries provide another classification of laws of nature, which
can be designated as a subdivision of natural laws. They use the term
<em>niyāma</em> to refer to these laws, consisting of five factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Utu-niyāma</em>: laws pertaining to the material world, in particular
to those dynamics in the natural environment related to temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bīja-niyāma</em>: laws pertaining to heredity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Citta-niyāma</em>: laws pertaining to the functions of the mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Kamma-niyāma</em>: law of kamma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Dhamma-niyāma</em>: the law of the interrelation between causes and
conditions, in particular to those laws operating independently
according to nature. For example: those things relying on conditions
for their existence must naturally come to an end; stream enterers
are naturally beyond spiritual regression; etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although this fifth factor of <em>dhamma-niyāma</em> is a key principle in the
teachings, which was explained frequently by the Buddha, and for which
there are numerous examples, it is surprising that the commentators in
this context do not explain it in the same way. In their explanations,
they simply refer to the normal attributes of a bodhisatta.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn132">132</a></sup> For
example: when a bodhisatta is conceived, born, and awakened, it is
normal for the ten-thousand world systems to shake; when a bodhisatta
enters his mother’s womb, it is natural that she is endowed with virtue
and free from any illness.</p>
<p>In the Mahāpadāna Sutta, which lists sixteen general rules pertaining to
the circumstances of a bodhisatta, the term <em>dhammatā</em> is used, rather
than <em>dhamma-niyāma</em>. Although these two terms are synonymous, their
meanings are not identical; they simply overlap. {223}</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-3-me-and-mine" id="appendix-3-me-and-mine">Appendix 3: ‘Me and Mine’</a></h2>
<p>The attachment to a sense of ‘me’ and ‘mine’ is firmly embedded in the
human mind. It has a deep impact on people’s behaviour, on their
wellbeing, and on human relationships, and it is connected to almost
every social problem. This attachment to a sense of self provides a core
focus for Dhamma practice: it must be attended to correctly and many
teachings address this issue. Many unique terms and expressions are used
to designate this form of attachment. Following is a summary of such
terms and expressions, organized into groups:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Group 1: <em>etaṃ mama, esohamasmi, eso me attā-ti</em>: ‘this is mine, I am
this, this is my self.’</em></p>
<p>Group 2: <em>ahanti vā mamanti vā asmīti vā</em>: ‘(the belief in) “I”, (the
belief in) “mine”, and (the belief), “I exist”.’</p>
<p>Group 3: <em>ahaṅkāra mamaṅkāra mānānusaya</em>: ‘(the belief in) “I”, (the
belief in) “mine”, and an underlying tendency of conceit.’</p>
<p>Group 4: <em>mamāyita</em> (or: <em>mamatta</em>) and <em>asmimāna</em>: the belief in
“mine”, (’the belief in “I”), and the conceit “I am”.’</p>
<p>Group 5: <em>attā</em>, <em>attaniya</em>, (and <em>asmīti</em>): the self, things
associated with the self, (and the belief ‘I exist’).</p>
<p>Group 6: <em>taṇhā</em>, <em>māna</em>, and <em>diṭṭhi</em>: craving, conceit, and fixed
views.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Group 1:</strong> these are the most frequently found terms relating to an
attachment to self. Most often this group is found in teachings
encouraging an analysis of human beings as consisting of the five
aggregates or of other elements like the six senses or the six forms of
contact, or in teachings that promote an investigation of the three
characteristics, leading to an understanding of things that prevents the
attachment: ‘this is mine’, ‘I am this’, or ‘this is my self’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn133">133</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Group 2:</strong> this group is an abbreviation of group #1 above: <em>ahanti</em>
(’a belief in “I” ‘) = <em>eso me attā</em>; <em>mamanti</em> (’a belief in “mine” ‘)
= <em>etaṃ mama</em>; <em>asmīti</em> (a belief such as ‘I am this’ or ‘I still
exist’) = <em>esohamasmi</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn134">134</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Group 3:</strong> this is another abbreviation of group #1: <em>ahaṅkāra</em> =
<em>eso me attā</em>; <em>mamaṅkāra</em> = <em>etaṃ mama</em>; <em>mānānusaya</em> = <em>esohamasmi</em>.
{224} These terms are most often found in the phrase: ‘There is an
absence of (or ‘freedom from’, or ‘eradication of’) “I-making”,
“mine-making” and an underlying tendency of conceit in regard to this
body with its consciousness and all external signs.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn135">135</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Group 4:</strong> the term <em>mamāyita</em> is most often used to mean ‘an
attachment as “mine” ‘ or ‘an object attached to as “mine” ‘ and is thus
equivalent to <em>etaṃ mama</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn136">136</a></sup> Occasionally it is defined as both a
belief in ‘I’ and a belief in ‘mine’ (equivalent to <em>etaṃ mama &amp; eso me
attā</em>, or to <em>taṇhā</em> &amp; <em>diṭṭhi</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn137">137</a></sup> <em>Mamatta</em> (or <em>mamattā</em>) has an
identical meaning to <em>mamāyita</em>, but tends to appear in verses paired
with <em>mamāyita</em> or in place of <em>mamāyita</em>,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn138">138</a></sup> or as a definition of
<em>mamāyita</em>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn139">139</a></sup> <em>Asmimāna</em> is defined as ‘the conceit “I am” ‘: a
sense of ‘I’ or the thought ‘I exist’. In Pali it is usually described
as simply <em>māna</em>, but the Abhidhamma classifies it as one of seven
different kinds of <em>māna</em>. <em>Asmimāna</em> is a refined form of
conceit,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn140">140</a></sup> which only arahants have abandoned; non-returners have
not yet done so.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn141">141</a></sup> The Abhidhamma distinguishes <em>asmimāna</em> from
other, coarser forms of conceit, like scorn and arrogance, which are
abandoned by awakened beings of lower levels. <em>Asmimāna</em> is usually
mentioned as a quality that Dhamma practitioners should eradicate.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn142">142</a></sup>
Essentially, the term <em>asmimāna</em> is identical to <em>esohamasmi</em> and it can
be simply called <em>māna</em>: (the most refined form of) conceit.</p>
<p><strong>Group 5:</strong> the terms in this group do not refer to attachment but
rather to things that are attached to, or to the state of affairs
arising due to attachment. If one makes a broad comparison with group
#1, <em>attā</em> is equivalent to <em>eso me attā</em> &amp; <em>esohamasmi</em>, while
<em>attaniya</em> is equivalent to <em>etaṃ mama</em>. Strictly speaking, however, the
term <em>attā</em> is confined to the view of possessing or existing as a
‘self’ (i.e. it pertains to ‘views’ – <em>diṭṭhi</em>). It therefore refers
only to <em>eso me attā</em>, not to <em>esohamasmi</em>. To encompass the entire
meaning of the first group, one needs to add the term <em>asmīti</em> to this
fifth group. It is possible to translate <em>attā</em> as ‘I’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn143">143</a></sup> and
<em>attaniya</em> as ‘mine’, but the meaning of the expression ‘I’ is not very
precise or constant and can shift to encompass either of the two beliefs
in group #1 (<em>esohamasmi</em> and <em>eso me attā</em>).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn144">144</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Group 6:</strong> the three unwholesome qualities (craving, conceit, and
view) are sometimes collectively referred to as <em>papañca</em> or
<em>papañca-dhammā</em>: ‘encumbrances’, ‘mental proliferation’, ‘things
leading to excess’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn145">145</a></sup> These qualities give rise to myriad,
complicated perceptions (<em>papañca-saññā</em>), as described in chapter 2.
{225}</p>
<p>They are grouped together here following a commentarial explanation. One
can compare and match these unwholesome qualities with the views and
attachments contained in the preceding groups as shown on
Table <a href="#tbl-craving-conceit-views">Craving, Conceit and Views</a>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn146">146</a></sup></p>
<div class="figure">
<p><span class="caption">Craving, Conceit and Views</span><a id="tbl-craving-conceit-views"></a>
<img src="./includes/images/diagrams/craving-conceit-views.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
<p>The English terms ‘me’ and ‘mine’ (or ‘I’ and ‘mine’) do not entirely
cover the meanings of these three groups; it is necessary to add another
expression: ‘I’, ‘mine’, and ‘this am I’. In any case, translations for
the second group (the ‘māna’ group) are sometimes imprecise and unusual.
One solution in the face of such flexible terminology is to use only the
two terms ‘I’ and ‘mine’, and then to define ‘I’ so that it covers both
<em>diṭṭhi</em> and <em>māna</em>. When it refers to a belief in a fixed sense of
personal identity, then it is equivalent to <em>diṭṭhi</em>; when it refers to
personal status, or to a personal identity used for comparison with
others, for personal evaluation, or as a source of pride, then it is
equivalent to <em>māna</em>. The term ‘mine’ is an accurate translation for the
first group (the ‘taṇhā’ group).</p>
<p><em>Diṭṭhi</em>, present in the form of <em>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</em> &amp; <em>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</em>
(the first and third fetters – <em>saṁyojana</em>), has been abandoned by
stream-enterers. <em>Taṇhā</em> (in the form of <em>kāma-rāga</em> – the fourth
fetter) has been abandoned by non-returners. <em>Taṇhā</em> (in the form of
<em>kāma-rāga</em>, <em>rūpa-rāga</em> &amp; <em>arūpa-rāga --</em> the fourth, sixth and seventh
fetters) and <em>māna</em> have been abandoned by arahants.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn147">147</a></sup></p>
<p>Following this interpretation one can give the following summary: the
fixed view of a sense of self is abandoned at stream-entry, while the
conceit ‘I am’ and attachment to a sense of personal ownership are
abandoned when realizing arahantship.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn148">148</a></sup> {226}</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-4-birth-and-death-in-the-present-moment" id="appendix-4-birth-and-death-in-the-present-moment">Appendix 4: Birth and Death in the Present Moment</a></h2>
<p>The following sutta passage may provide insight to those who wish to
research the cycle of birth and death (saṁsāra-vaṭṭa) as it occurs in
the present moment – as it occurs in this present lifetime:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>‘The festering forms of self-conceiving do not accumulate for a person
established in four qualities [wisdom, truth, relinquishment, and
peace], and when such defiled self-conceiving is not accumulated he
is called a sage at peace.’</p>
<p>So was it said; and in reference to what was it said? ‘I am’ is a
conceiving, ‘I am not’ is a conceiving, ‘I shall be’ is a conceiving,
‘I shall not be’ is a conceiving, ‘I shall be possessed of form’ is a
conceiving, ‘I shall be formless’ is a conceiving, ‘I shall be
percipient’ is a conceiving, ‘I shall be non-percipient’ is a
conceiving, ‘I shall be neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient’ is a
conceiving.</p>
<p>Bhikkhu, conceiving is a disease, conceiving is an abscess, conceiving
is a dart. By overcoming all self-conceivings one is called a sage at
peace. And the sage at peace is not born, does not age, does not die;
he is not anxious and does not crave. For there exists no cause by
which he might be born. Not being born, how could he age? Not aging,
how could he die? Not dying, how could he be anxious? Not being
anxious, how could he crave?</p>
<p>So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘The festering
forms of self-conceiving do not accumulate for a person established in
four qualities, and when such defiled self-conceiving is not
accumulated he is called a sage at peace.’ Bhikkhu, bear in mind this
brief exposition of the six elements.’</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-5-abhidhamma-interpretation-of-dependent-origination" id="appendix-5-abhidhamma-interpretation-of-dependent-origination">Appendix 5: Abhidhamma Interpretation of Dependent Origination</a></h2>
<p>The Abhidhamma describes many variations to the process of Dependent
Origination, according to the state of mind (citta), i.e. as wholesome,
unwholesome, or ‘indeterminate’,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn149">149</a></sup> and according to the level of
mind, i.e. as dwelling in the sense sphere, the fine-material sphere, or
the immaterial sphere, or as transcendent.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn150">150</a></sup> The factors of
Dependent Origination may vary according to these states of mind and are
not always identical to the factors mentioned in the suttas. For
example, in some wholesome states of mind the process commences with
volitional formations without a mention of ignorance, or it may begin
with a wholesome root-cause (<em>kusala-mūla</em>) as a substitute for
ignorance. Of particular note, craving is only found in unwholesome
states of mind; in other states it is replaced by pasāda
(’satisfaction’, ‘joy’, ‘confidence’) or left out entirely.</p>
<p>Because the Abhidhamma examines the mind on a momentary basis, it
therefore only analyzes the factors present in each specific moment.
Factors such as ignorance or craving, which may be temporarily
suppressed, are not identified by name; they are inferred by the
presence of other clearly manifest factors, or else they are completely
overlooked.</p>
<p>The Abhidhamma describes the various factors of Dependent Origination
both in forward and in reverse: ignorance conditions volitional
formations and volitional formations condition ignorance; volitional
formations condition consciousness and consciousness conditions
volitional formations; etc. Here I will only present the primary
categories for consideration: {227}</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-6-nirodha-cessation" id="appendix-6-nirodha-cessation">Appendix 6: Nirodha (’Cessation’)</a></h2>
<p>The term ‘cessation’ has become the standard translation for
nirodha.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn153">153</a></sup> When alternative translations for nirodha are used,
people may raise objections or they become confused, thinking that these
alternatives are derived from other Pali words. In Buddhadhamma, I too
have relied on the term ‘cessation’ for the sake of convenience, and to
avoid the misunderstanding that another Pali word is being referred to
(and also because I have not found a suitable, concise replacement). But
there are many occasions where the term ‘cessation’ itself may lead to
misunderstanding and is technically the incorrect translation.</p>
<p>The word ‘cessation’ in English generally means the destruction or end
of something that has already arisen. <em>Nirodha</em> in Dependent Origination
(and in the third Noble Truth – <em>dukkhanirodha-ariyasacca</em>), however,
means that something does not arise because no causes exist for it to
arise. For example, the phrase <em>avijjā-nirodhā saṅkhāra-nirodho</em> is
translated as: ‘Because ignorance ceases, volitional formations cease’.
In fact, this phrase means that because ignorance does not exist, or
does not arise, or there are no problems associated with ignorance,
volitional formations do not exist, do not arise, and there are no
problems associated with volitional formations. It does not necessarily
mean that existing ignorance must be terminated in order to terminate
existing volitional formations.</p>
<p>There are occasions when <em>nirodha</em> is accurately translated as
‘cessation’, for instance when referring to the nature of conditioned
phenomena, and when acting as a synonym for <em>bhaṅga</em> (’breaking up’),
<em>anicca</em> (’impermanence’), <em>khaya</em> (’destruction’), and <em>vaya</em>
(’decay’). For example: <em>Bhikkhus, these three feelings are impermanent,
conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, subject to
dissolution, subject to vanishing, subject to cessation.</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn154">154</a></sup> (Every
factor of Dependent Origination has these attributes mentioned in this
quotation.) Having arisen, conditioned phenomena automatically must
decline, according to the nature of causes and conditions. One need not
try to make them decline; they will decline of their own accord. The
practical application of this teaching is to see that all that arises
must cease.</p>
<p>Although it describes a natural, objective process, the teaching of
<em>nirodha</em> in the third Noble Truth (= <em>paṭiccasamuppāda-nirodhavāra</em>)
emphasizes practical application. There are two interpretations of
<em>nirodha</em> in this context:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn155">155</a></sup> the first derives from the prefix <em>ni-</em>
(’non-existence’; ‘without’) + <em>rodha</em> (= <em>cāraka</em> = ‘prison’,
‘confinement’, ‘restriction’, ‘obstruction’, ‘impediment’), translated
as ‘free from limitation’, ‘free from restriction’, ‘free from
confinement’: i.e. free from <em>saṁsāra</em>. The second interpretation
equates <em>nirodha</em> with <em>anuppāda</em>: ‘non-arising’.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn156">156</a></sup> In this context
<em>nirodha</em> does not mean cessation or dissolution (<em>bhaṅga</em>).</p>
<p>Although the translation of <em>nirodha</em> as ‘cessation’ is not always
accurate, I have so far been unable to find a concise term to use
instead and therefore use the customary translation. It is important,
however, to understand the meaning of this word in different contexts.
For this reason, these alternative translations for the cessation cycle
of Dependent Origination are valid: ‘With an absence of ignorance, there
is an absence of volitional formations’; ‘with freedom from ignorance,
there is freedom from volitional formations’; ‘when ignorance no longer
bears fruit, volitional formations cease to bear fruit’; ‘when no
problems exist as a consequence of ignorance, no problems exist as a
consequence of volitional formations’.</p>
<p>There are further complications regarding translation of terms in the
origination cycle of Dependent Origination. The Pali terms cover a wider
range of meaning than can be captured by single English counterparts.
For example, the teaching: <em>Avijjā-paccayā saṅkhārā</em> ... <em>jātipaccayā
jarāmaraṇaṃ</em> in Pali can also mean: ‘Because ignorance exists in this
way, volitional formations exist in this way; because volitional
formations exist in this way, consciousness exists in this way ...
because becoming exists in this way, birth exists in this way; because
there is birth, there is aging-and-death.’ {230}</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-8-bhava-taṇhā-and-vibhava-taṇhā" id="appendix-8-bhava-taṇhā-and-vibhava-taṇhā">Appendix 8: Bhava-taṇhā and Vibhava-taṇhā</a></h2>
<p>Translation of the three kinds of craving (kāma-<em>taṇhā</em>, bhava-<em>taṇhā</em>,
and vibhava-<em>taṇhā</em>), especially the second and third kinds, may cause
problems due to insufficient understanding of these terms and
conflicting opinions. The following points may help clarify this matter:</p>
<p>Although there are suttas in which the three kinds of craving are
clearly mentioned, for example in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn157">157</a></sup>
the Saṅgīti Sutta and the Dasuttara Sutta,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn158">158</a></sup> nowhere in the suttas
are the definitions for these three clearly outlined or directly
addressed. We therefore must depend on the explanations found in the
Abhidhamma and the commentaries. However, because people sometimes
gather sketchy or incomplete information, or they are unable to clearly
interpret such information, there have arisen divergent and conflicting
views on this subject.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that there are no explicit definitions in the suttas
for these three kinds of craving, there are some teachings by the Buddha
and some related passages that cast light on the meanings of these
terms. Here I will present evidence from the suttas, the Abhidhamma, and
the commentaries for contemplation.</p>
<p>The Buddha mentions the three kinds of craving in the Taṇhā Sutta of the
Itivuttaka. Although he does not present explicit definitions, he utters
a verse that can be used to further understand their meanings. A literal
translation of this sutta (free from commentarial interpretation)
appears as follows: {231}</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, there are these three cravings. What three? The craving for
sense pleasures, the craving for existence, and the craving for
non-existence....</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Bound with the bondage of craving,<br />
People’s minds delight in becoming and non-becoming (bhavābhave).<br />
Bound by the fetters of Māra, with no safety from bondage,<br />
These beings go through the cycle of rebirth, headed for birth and
death.<br />
But those in the world who have destroyed craving, free from the
craving for becoming and non-becoming,<br />
Reaching the end of the taints, have gone to the other shore.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It. 50.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Another sutta in the Itivuttaka describes the two ‘views’ –
<em>bhava-diṭṭhi</em> &amp; <em>vibhava-diṭṭhi</em> – and by doing so it indirectly
describes bhava-<em>taṇhā</em> &amp; vibhava-<em>taṇhā</em> as well:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhus, both devas and humans are possessed by two views. Some are
bogged down, some overreach, while those with vision see.</p>
<p>And how, monks, are some bogged down?</p>
<p>Devas and humans delight in becoming (bhavārāmā), rejoice in becoming
(bhava-ratā), take pleasure in becoming (bhava-sammuditā). When the
Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma for the cessation of becoming
(bhava-nirodha), the hearts of those devas and humans do not leap
forward, do not gain confidence, do not become settled, do not yield.
Thus are some bogged down.</p>
<p>And how, monks, do some overreach?</p>
<p>Some devas and humans are afflicted, depressed, and disgusted by
becoming. They delight in non-becoming,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn159">159</a></sup> saying: ‘My good sir,
with the breaking up of the body at death, this self is annihilated,
destroyed, and no longer exists. This state is supreme, excellent and
true.’ Thus do some overreach.</p>
<p>And how, monks, do those with vision see?</p>
<p>In this case, a monk sees the state of being as the state of
being.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn160">160</a></sup> When he sees the state of being as the state of being, he
practises for disenchantment (nibbidā), dispassion (virāga), and
cessation (nirodha) in regard to the state of being. Thus do those
with vision see.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Whoever sees being as being,<br />
And sees the state beyond being,<br />
Surrenders to the Truth,<br />
Through the exhaustion of lust for existence.<br />
With full understanding of the state of being,<br />
One is free from craving,<br />
For both existence and extinction.<br />
With the end of becoming in the state of existence,<br />
A monk comes not to further birth.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Diṭṭhi Sutta: It. 43-4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>There are two noteworthy points concerning this sutta:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Buddha mentions craving and views in tandem because they are
related and interdependent. One type of person delights in becoming,
yearns for existence (<em>bhava-rama</em>, <em>bhava-abhirama</em> =
<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>), and holds the firm conviction that this state of
existence is desirable and is a place of stability for the ‘self’
(<em>bhava-diṭṭhi</em>). Another type of person loathes existence, delights
in non-existence, desires extinction (<em>vibhava-abhinanda</em> =
<em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>), and firmly believes that the ‘self’ will expire
(<em>vibhava-diṭṭhi</em> = <em>uccheda-diṭṭhi</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sutta differentiates between <em>vibhava</em> (the absence of
existence; non-existence; extinction), which is a belief connected
to wrong view, and <em>bhava-nirodha</em> (the end of becoming), which is
the goal of Buddha-Dhamma. <em>Vibhava</em> is the opposite of <em>bhava</em> –
these are the two extremes explained in this sutta: some people get
stuck at the extreme of becoming, others at the extreme of
extinction. The Buddha taught the escape from these two extremes.
His teachings emphasize <em>bhava-nirodha</em>, which does not fall into
either extreme but rather rests in the middle. If one understands
this concept, then one understands the Middle Teaching and the
Middle Way. {232}</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Craving and views are distinct qualities and yet they are very similar:
they are often paired and they are interdependent. When one views
something in a positive light, one wants to acquire that thing. When one
wants to get something, one sees it as something worthy of getting, and
due to a lack of understanding of the object one creates various
opinions about it. In the definitions of craving below, <em>diṭṭhi</em> is used
to clarify the meaning of <em>taṇhā</em>: a particular kind of craving is
directly related to a particular kind of view. This explanation
notwithstanding, craving and views should be recognized as two distinct
qualities.</p>
<p>There is a passage in verse in the Purābheda Sutta of the Sutta Nipāta,
along with related explanations in the Mahāniddesa and the commentaries,
that clarifies the meaning of the terms <em>bhava-taṇhā</em> and
<em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>One who understands the truth, who is independent (free from craving
and views), who does not rely on anything (whose mind is emancipated),
has no craving for existence or non-existence. Such a person I call
one who is calmed.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn161">161</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Sn. 167-8.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The important clause in this passage is: <em>Bhavāya vibhavāya vā taṇhā</em>,
which can be divided into <em>bhavāya taṇhā</em> (craving for existence) and
<em>vibhavāya taṇhā</em> (craving for non-existence).</p>
<p>These two terms are expansions on the terms <em>bhava-taṇhā</em> and
<em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>. The Mahāniddesa interprets this passage of the Sutta
Nipāta by defining <em>taṇhā</em> as the craving for sights, smells, sounds,
tastes, tactile objects, and mental objects, and it interprets <em>bhavāya</em>
and <em>vibhavāya</em> in several ways: (1) <em>bhavāya</em> is equivalent to
<em>bhava-diṭṭhi</em> and <em>vibhavāya</em> is equivalent to <em>vibhava-diṭṭhi</em>; (2)
<em>bhavāya</em> equals <em>sassata-diṭṭhi</em> and <em>vibhavāya</em> equals
<em>uccheda-diṭṭhi</em> (this interpretation is essentially the same as the
preceding one); (3) <em>bhavāya</em> is defined as a craving for repeated
existence, for repeated spheres of existence (<em>gati</em>), for repeated
arising, for repeated rebirth, for repeated birth of an individuality.
In this third interpretation <em>vibhavāya</em> is not mentioned, but based on
the three definitions of <em>bhavāya</em> one may define <em>vibhavāya</em> as the
craving for non-existence or for extinction.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn162">162</a></sup></p>
<p>The Abhidhamma offers several definitions for <em>taṇhā</em>. In some places
only <em>bhava-taṇhā</em> is explained, in which case it is paired with
<em>avijjā</em>:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Of these two qualities, what is ‘<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>’? Pleasure in
existence, delight in existence, enjoyment in existence, desire for
existence, love for existence, craving for existence, infatuation with
existence, obsession with existence. This is called ‘<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>.’</p>
<p><em>Dhs. 227; Vbh. 358.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Another passage explains the three kinds of craving thus:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Of these three kinds of craving, what is craving for existence
(<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>)? Desire, infatuation, delight, satisfaction,
enjoyment, fascination, and mental preoccupation, accompanied by views
of existence (<em>bhava-diṭṭhi</em>). This is called craving for existence.
And what is craving for non-existence (<em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>)? Desire,
infatuation, delight, satisfaction, enjoyment, fascination, and mental
preoccupation, accompanied by views of annihilation
(<em>uccheda-diṭṭhi</em>). This is called craving for non-existence. Craving
apart from this is called sense craving (<em>kāma-taṇhā</em>).</p>
<p>[Alternatively], of these three cravings, what is sense craving?
Desire, infatuation ... mental preoccupation, accompanied by the
elements of sensuality (<em>kāma-dhātu</em>). This is called sense craving.
Desire, infatuation ... mental preoccupation, accompanied by the
fine-material and immaterial elements. This is called craving for
existence. Desire, infatuation ... mental preoccupation, accompanied
by views of annihilation. This is called craving for non-existence.</p>
<p><em>Vbh. 365.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The commentary to the first sutta from the Itivuttaka mentioned above
explains <em>bhavābhave</em> as ‘(the mind entangled in) minor and major states
of existence’, and offers another definition for <em>bhava</em> as an
eternalist view and <em>abhava</em> as an annihilationist view.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn163">163</a></sup> The mind
is entangled in existence and non-existence, in an eternalist viewpoint
and an annihilationist viewpoint, and thus <em>bhava</em> and <em>vibhava</em> here
refer to <em>bhava-taṇhā</em> and <em>vibhava-taṇhā</em>. The commentary to the second
sutta from the Itivuttaka mentioned above explains <em>bhavābhave</em> as
‘minor and major states of existence’, or an adherence, for example, to
an annihilationist view.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn164">164</a></sup> Another section of this same commentary
explains <em>bhavābhavo</em> thus: <em>bhava</em> = <em>sampatti</em> (’prosperity’,
‘growth’) and <em>abhava</em> = <em>vipatti</em> (’decrease’, ‘decline’).<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn165">165</a></sup> {233}</p>
<p>The explanation of the Purābheda Sutta (see above) found in the
commentaries of the Sutta-Nipāta and of the Mahāniddesa offer this
interpretation: <em>Bhavāya vibhavāya vāti sassatāya ucchedāya vā</em>. This
interpretation can be translated as: ‘(Craving for) existence or
non-existence, that is, for permanence or for extinction.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn166">166</a></sup> (Some
translators add the passage ‘for an eternalist view or an
annihilationist view’ here, to correspond with other texts.)</p>
<p>The commentary of the Paṭisambhidāmagga gives two clear explanations of
the three kinds of craving, including a complete reference to the
definitions presented in the Abhidhamma. The first explanation defines
<em>bhava-taṇhā</em>, which is paired with <em>avijjā</em>, as: ‘The desire for states
of existence, for example the sense realm.’<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn167">167</a></sup> It refers to the
passages in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī and the Vibhaṅga cited earlier,<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn168">168</a></sup> and
explains the three kinds of craving by referring to another passage in
the Vibhaṅga, also cited earlier.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn169">169</a></sup> Finally it states:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>The commentaries state:</p>
<p>‘Lust associated with the five strands of sensuality is called
kāma-taṇhā; lust for the fine-material and immaterial spheres,
attachment to jhāna, lust connected to an eternalist view, and the
desire generated by the power of becoming is called bhava-taṇhā; and
the lust connected to an annihilationist view is called
vibhava-taṇhā.’</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The commentary to the Saṅgīti Sutta contains the same explanation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn170">170</a></sup></p>
<p>The second explanation describes the three kinds of craving thus:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p><em>Kāma-taṇhā</em> is lust for sensuality (<em>kāme taṇhā</em>). The term
<em>kāma-taṇhā</em> here refers to lust (<em>rāga</em>) associated with the five
strands of sensuality. <em>Bhava-taṇhā</em> is lust for existence (<em>bhave
taṇhā</em>). The term <em>bhava-taṇhā</em> refers to lust connected to an
eternalist view, which is generated by the force of desire for
existence; it refers to lust for fine-material and immaterial states
of existence, and to attachment to <em>jhāna</em>. <em>Vibhava-taṇhā</em> is lust
for non-existence (<em>vibhave taṇhā</em>). The term <em>vibhava-taṇhā</em> refers
to lust connected to an annihilationist view.</p>
<p><em>PsA. I. 158.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This explanation is also found in the commentary to the Vibhaṅga.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn171">171</a></sup></p>
<p>The Visuddhimagga usually explains important subjects in keeping with
the other commentaries, but on the subject of the three kinds of
craving, it says very little. It explains these three cravings only in
the section on the one hundred and eight kinds of craving, which offers
a different perspective:</p>
<div class="sutta">
<blockquote>
<p>Each of these six kinds of craving (for sights, sounds, smells,
tastes, tactile objects and mind objects) is reckoned threefold
according to its manner of occurrence, as sense craving, craving for
becoming, or craving for non-becoming. Indeed, when the craving for
visual forms enjoys in the manner of sense-desire enjoyment a visual
object that has come into the focus of the eye, it is called sense
craving. When the craving for visual forms is accompanied by the view
that the visual object is lasting and constant, it is called craving
for becoming, because the lust associated with an eternalist view is
called craving for becoming. But when the craving for visual forms is
accompanied by the annihilationist view that this visual object breaks
up and is destroyed, it is called craving for non-becoming, because
the lust associated with an annihilationist view is called craving for
non-becoming.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn172">172</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Vism. 567-8; same as VbhA. 179.</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>The explanation in the Saddhammapakāsinī (the commentary to the
Paṭisambhidāmagga) integrates the definitions for the three kinds of
craving in a clear and satisfactory way, by incorporating the
definitions from the various texts, both the Pali Canon and the
commentaries. Here is a simple presentation of these definitions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Kāma-taṇhā</em>: craving for sensuality; lust associated with the five
strands of sensuality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Bhava-taṇhā</em>: craving for existence; lust for the fine-material and
immaterial spheres of existence; attachment to jhāna; desire
associated with an eternalist view, which is expressed in the desire
for existence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Vibhava-taṇhā</em>: craving for non-existence; desire associated with
an annihilationist view, which is expressed in the desire for an
absence of existence or for extinction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that <em>vibhava</em> (the absence of existence; the end of existence;

<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-9-detailed-description-of-consciousness" id="appendix-9-detailed-description-of-consciousness">Appendix 9: Detailed Description of Consciousness</a></h2>
<p>A detailed doctrinal description of consciousness: the thirty-two
mundane kinds of consciousness (the five kinds of consciousness of
wholesome fruition – kusala-vipāka, the five kinds of consciousness of
unwholesome fruition – akusala-vipāka, and the twenty-two kinds of
mind-consciousness). Alternatively: the thirteen kinds of consciousness
(the five kinds of consciousness of wholesome fruition, the five kinds
of consciousness of unwholesome fruition, the two ‘mind elements’ –
mano-dhātu, and the mind-consciousness element unaccompanied by a root
cause and accompanied by joy –
manoviññāṇadhātu-ahetuka-somanassasahagata) arising in the course of an
individual existence (pavatti-kāla: between conception and death), plus
the remaining nineteen kinds of consciousness arising in both the course
of an individual existence and at the moment of conception.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#appendix-10-metaphysical-dilemmas" id="appendix-10-metaphysical-dilemmas">Appendix 10: Metaphysical Dilemmas</a></h2>
<p>There are many reasons why the Buddha refused to answer these
metaphysical questions (formerly they were referred to as ‘knowledge
concerning the self’ – adhyātma-vidyā). Most importantly, these
questions originate from a wrong view, for example from the belief in a
‘self’, and they therefore do not correspond with the truth. As the
Buddha mentioned above, they are ‘invalid’ questions. Secondly, the
answers to these questions are not accessible through reasoning. Such an
attempt is made in vain, like trying to get people to visualize an image
with their ears. Since these questions cannot be answered by logic,
intellectual debate about them does not generate any practical value.</p>
<p>The Buddha emphasized those things that have practical relevance to our
everyday lives and therefore he dismissed these metaphysical
speculations. He encouraged the questioner to turn to practical issues
and to not waste time. For questions that can truly be answered, the
Buddha urged people to apply practical means to reach the truth rather
than get lost in debate and blind speculation.</p>
<p>The Buddha lived at a time when there was an intense interest in these
questions and when leaders of many religious sects were engaged in such
debate. It is fair to say that these were signature questions and ideas
of people at that time. People, however, were so preoccupied by these
questions that they became alienated from the truths of their own
existence. There being no benefit to engaging with these people at this
level of debate, the Buddha’s strategy was to remain silent, thus not
fuelling the debates and instead spurring people to turn to those things
he was teaching. See chapter 19 of Buddhadhamma on the Four Noble
Truths.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#fn173">173</a></sup></p>

<p>Restraint of the senses (<em>indriya-saṁvara</em>) does not mean sense
deprivation – for example shutting ones eyes to the world. At early
stages of practice, it implies a degree of caution and skill when
receiving sense impressions, not allowing the mind to be overwhelmed
by evil unwholesome states. At higher levels of realization, one can
develop the sense bases and gain mastery over sense impressions; one
has the ability to control one’s responses according to one’s
wishes. See the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta: M. III. 298-302.</p>

important Buddhist principle is that well-developed moral conduct is
conducive to concentration. One attribute of coarse language is that
it is an obstacle to concentration (<em>asamādhi-saṁvattanikā</em>), and an
objective of polite speech is to act as a support for concentration.
